Bioculture,"Bioculture is the combination of biological and cultural factors that affect human behavior. It is an area of study bounded by the medical sciences, social sciences, landscape ecology, cultural anthropology, biotechnology, disability studies, the humanities, and the economic and global environment. Along these lines, one can see the biosphere — the earth as it is affected by the human — as the adaptation of the natural to the human and biocultures as the inter-adaptation of the human to the new technologies and ways of knowing characterized by the 21st century’s attitude toward the body. It assumes that in bioculture there is a diverse way to know the workings of the body and mind, and that these are primarily culturally derived, and an expert's way of knowing produces specific strong results. However, the results do not have an exclusive purview over the body and mind. Plus, it seeks to develop and encourage not only the experts but also parts of people's bodies and minds as the subject of study.

Alternative definitions
An alternative definition of the term bioculture is all the practical aspects of the use of living things in culture, including agriculture, production of food and clothing, forestry, animal breeding and training, the pet trade, use of living things in science, zoos and aquariums, animal sports, and the raising of game for sport hunting.

Existence
The term bioculture does not exist as such in the English or Spanish dictionary. BioCultura is a trademark registered in 1983 by the Asociación Vida Sana. The Asociación Vida Sana, elaborated in 1981 the bases for the development of ecological agriculture in Spain through the booklets of norms of ecological agriculture, thus contributing to the health of consumers and, on the other, to the decontamination of the land , water and air, stopping the pollution of the techniques of industrialized agriculture, without counting on the no less obvious and considerable economic and social advantages that these alternatives offer. In 1983 he began to organize the BioCultura fair in Madrid with the support of the city council. The aim was to offer an opportunity to the first organic producers to make their products known to consumers. And they coined the term BioCultura from the prefix Bio joined to the word culture. The trademark was registered in the Patent and Trademark Office. The use and popularity of the brand has caused it to be used as a vocable to determine the sector of the ""bio or eco culture"", although it is a brand. After 40 years leading the universe of ecological, sustainable culture and responsible consumption in Spain, BioCultura creates BioCultura ON, now for the entire Spanish-speaking community of the world.

Ethics in Bioculture
Moral ethical behavior deals with how humans behave with each other,  likewise Bioculture ethics deals with how humans treat animals and plants. Ethics in Bioculture come into question especially in situations, where the animals and plants are in art",science
Belle Époque,"The Belle Époque (French pronunciation: [bɛlepɔk]) or La Belle Époque (French for 'The Beautiful Era') was a period of French and European history that began after the end of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 and continued until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Occurring during the era of the French Third Republic, it was a period characterised by optimism, enlightenment, romanticism, regional peace, economic prosperity, conservatism, nationalism, colonial expansion, and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In this era of France's cultural and artistic climate (particularly in Paris of that time), the arts markedly flourished, and numerous masterpieces of literature, music, theatre and visual art gained extensive recognition.
The Belle Époque was so named in retrospect, when it began to be considered a continental European ""Golden Age"" in contrast to the horrors of the Napoleonic Wars and World War I. The Belle Époque was a period in which, according to historian R. R. Palmer, ""European civilisation achieved its greatest power in global politics, and also exerted its maximum influence upon peoples outside Europe.""

Popular culture and fashions
Two devastating world wars and their aftermath made the Belle Époque appear to be a time of joie de vivre (joy of living) in contrast to 19th century hardships. It was also a period of stability that France enjoyed after the tumult of the early years of the Third Republic, featuring defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the uprising of the Paris Commune, and the fall of General Georges Ernest Boulanger. The defeat of Boulanger, and the celebrations tied to the 1889 World's Fair in Paris, launched an era of optimism and affluence. French imperialism was in its prime. It was a cultural center of global influence, its educational, scientific and medical institutions were at the leading edge of Europe.
It was not entirely the reality of life in Paris or in France, however. France had a large economic underclass who never experienced much of the Belle Époque's wonders and entertainments. Poverty remained endemic in Paris's urban slums and rural peasantry for decades after the Belle Époque ended. Conflicts between the government and the Roman Catholic Church were regular during the period. Some of the artistic elite saw the Fin de siècle in a pessimistic light.

Those who were able to benefit from the prosperity of the era were drawn towards new forms of light entertainment during the Belle Époque, and the Parisian bourgeoisie, or the successful industrialists called the nouveaux riches, became increasingly influenced by the habits and fads of the city's elite social class, known popularly as Tout-Paris (""all of Paris"", or ""everyone in Paris""). The Casino de Paris opened in 1890. For Paris's less affluent public, entertainment was provided by cabarets, bistros and music halls.
The Moulin Rouge cabaret is a Paris landmark still open for business today. The Folies Bergère was another landmark venue. B",history

Artificial intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.
High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: ""A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.""
Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the AI boom. The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of AI and its long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.

Armenia without Armenians,"""Armenia without Armenians"" is a phrase with different meanings.

Armenian genocide
Some Armenian and non-Armenian scholars use the phrase in reference to the aftermath of the Armenian genocide of 1915, which left the Turkish-controlled parts of the Armenian homeland without significant Armenian population.

Russian Empire
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several Russian officials proposed the policy of ""Armenia without Armenians"", most notably Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, foreign minister in 1895–96.
During World War I, the Russian army occupied Western Armenia with the help of Armenian volunteer units. In 1916, the Russian government disbanded the Armenian volunteer units. General Nikolai Yudenich, who led the Russian army into the Armenian-populated areas of the Ottoman Empire during the Caucasian Campaign of World War I, proposed a plan of deporting the remaining Armenians from their ancestral homes. The Russian government seriously considered the possibility of repopulating the Armenian lands by Russian peasants and Cossacks.

Emigration from Armenia
In the early 21st century, the phrase is often used to refer to emigration from Armenia. In 2009 the Russian government began a migration program, called ""Compatriots"", which encourages Armenians to settle in Russia. Sociologist Ruben Yeganyan, First Nagorno-Karabakh War veteran Sargis Hatspanyan, and political analyst Ruben Mehrabyan stated that the program leaves Armenia without Armenians. In 2013 Hatspanyan linked what he saw as Russia's policy of an ""Armenia without Armenians"" to the Armenian government's decision to join the Eurasian Union and the possibility of a mass emigration to Russia.

Branches of science,"The branches of science, also referred to as sciences, scientific fields or scientific disciplines, are commonly divided into three major groups:

Formal sciences: the study of formal systems, such as those under the branches of logic and mathematics, which use an a priori, as opposed to empirical, methodology. They study abstract structures described by formal systems.
Natural sciences: the study of natural phenomena (including cosmological, geological, physical, chemical, and biological factors of the universe). Natural science can be divided into two main branches: physical science and life science (or biology).
Social sciences: the study of human behavior in its social and cultural aspects.
Scientific knowledge must be grounded in observable phenomena and must be capable of being verified by other researchers working under the same conditions.
Natural, social, and formal science make up the fundamental sciences, which form the basis of interdisciplinarity - and applied sciences such as engineering and medicine. Specialized scientific disciplines that exist in multiple categories may include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own terminologies and expertises.

Formal sciences
The formal sciences are the branches of science that are concerned with formal systems, such as logic, mathematics, theoretical computer science, information theory, systems theory, decision theory, statistics.
Unlike other branches, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the real world (empirical knowledge), but rather with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules.  Hence there is disagreement on whether the formal sciences actually constitute as a science.  Methods of the formal sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of scientific models dealing with observable reality, and major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in the empirical sciences.

Logic
Logic (from Greek: λογική, logikḗ, 'possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative') is the systematic study of valid rules of inference, i.e. the relations that lead to the acceptance of one proposition (the conclusion) on the basis of a set of other propositions (premises). More broadly, logic is the analysis and appraisal of arguments.
It has traditionally included the classification of arguments; the systematic exposition of the logical forms; the validity and soundness of deductive reasoning; the strength of inductive reasoning; the study of formal proofs and inference (including paradoxes and fallacies); and the study of syntax and semantics.
Historically, logic has been studied in philosophy (since ancient times) and mathematics (since the mid-19th century).  More recently, logic has been studied in cognitive science, which draws on computer science, linguistics, philosophy and psychology, among other disciplines.

Equivalence (trade),"Equivalence is a term applied by the Uruguay Round Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. World Trade Organization (WTO) Member countries shall accord acceptance to the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures of other countries (even if those measures differ from their own or from those used by other Member countries trading in the same product) if the exporting country demonstrates to the importing country that its measures achieve the importer’s appropriate level of sanitary and phytosanitary protection.

History
In June 2021 a trade dispute threatened to erupt between the UK and the von der Leyen Commission over the Northern Irish Protocol (NIP) which flowed from Brexit. The position of Lord Frost and the Johnson government was that trade equivalence with the European Union over SPS measures could be maintained with ""a recognition of mutually high standards"", whereas his opposite number Maros Sefcovic insisted that Northern Ireland join the Common Veterinary Area which resulted from the SUEVA under a dynamic alignment. President Biden had even been drawn into the diplomatic conflict because his National Security Advisor feared a breakdown in public order. A leaked memo obtained by the Times of London ""suggested that if the UK signed up to EU rules on agricultural standards to ease problems with the NIP Mr Biden would ensure it did not 'negatively affect the chances of reaching a US/UK trade deal'"".

Methodological nationalism,"In social science, methodological nationalism is an intellectual orientation and pattern in scholarly research that conceives of the nation-state as the sole unit of analysis or as a container for social processes. This concept has largely been developed by Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, who specifically define it as ""the assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern world"". Methodological nationalism has been identified in many social science subfields, such as anthropology, sociology, and the interdisciplinary field of migration studies. Methodological Nationalism, as a practice within Social Science, has been further critiqued by scholars such as Saskia Sassen, who contends that the nation-state and its borders are an insufficient unit of analysis and that the national is at times the ""terrains of the global"".

Three types of methodological nationalism
According to Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, there are three types of methodological nationalism in social science scholarship: ignoring or disregarding the importance of nationalism for modern societies, naturalization, and confining studies to geopolitical boundaries of a particular nation-state. These types may co-occur or occur separately. When they co-occur, they may reinforce each other.
Speranta Dumitru distinguished between other three different versions of methodological nationalism: state-centrism (unjustified supremacy granted to the nation-state), territorialism (understanding space as divided in territories), and groupism (equating society with the nation-state’s society). She argued that methodological nationalism heavily biases the philosophy of migration.

Methodological nationalism and migration studies
Methodological nationalism and its conception of nation-states has been a component of both contemporary and historical methodologies in migration studies, insofar as certain studies have adhered to it or diverged from its theoretical foundations. This adherence has been acknowledged or otherwise criticized  in numerous studies. Moreover, the historical prevalence of methodological nationalism within social science has been explored by scholarship which argues that many turn-of-the-century writings on globalization have  ""conflated the necessary
conceptual critique of methodological nationalism with the empirical claim of the
nation-state’s diminishing relevance"".
On the other hand, research on  transnationalism and transmigrants has contemporary examples of divergence and criticism of methodological nationalism as an enduring practice in scholarship. Recent studies in transnationalism have conceived of the nation-state as one agent in a complex relationship with many global actors. Migration Studies that conceive of society as extending beyond national boundaries, then, sever this link between nation-state and society.

Arab street,"The Arab street (Arabic: الشارع العربي, ash-shāriʿ al-ʿarabī) is an expression referring to the spectrum of public opinion in the Arab world, often as opposed or contrasted to the opinions of Arab governments. In some contexts it refers more specifically to the lower socioeconomic strata of Arab society. It is used primarily in the United States and Arab countries.
While it is sometimes assumed, particularly in the United States, to have been borrowed from Arabic political discourse, its evolution has followed a circular course from Arabic to English and then back. Lebanese newspapers began referring to just ""the street"" during the 1950s; later in the decade reports in The New York Times used the term in English to explain Gamal Abdel Nasser's broad appeal not just in his native Egypt but across the Arab world. Later commentators added the ""Arab"" and eventually dropped the scare quotes to create the current usage, which became widespread in American media during the First Palestinian Intifada in 1987. Arab media began using it themselves a decade later. However, its usage still differs between the two languages. In the Western English-language media, only Arab popular sentiment is referred to as the ""street""; Arabic commentators use the expression in the same sense to refer to not just public opinion in their countries but in the West as well.
Due to the many negative connotations attached to the use of ""street"" as a modifier, the use of the term in English has been criticized as fostering stereotypes of a population easily roused to violence. The ""Arab street"" thus alternately justifies the need for an authoritarian ruler, or constrains the potentially moderate actions of those rulers. In the wake of the Arab Spring early in the 2010s, the concept of the Arab street has been revisited and challenged. The revolutions that toppled governments have, to some, shown how deficient and outdated Western understandings of Arab public opinion, shaped by the concept of the ""Arab street"", had been and have even led some to suggest it no longer be used. Others, including some Arabs, saw the uprisings as vindicating the importance of public opinion in their cultures and changing the popular concept of the street within them.

Definition
Attempts to directly define the Arab street have usually equated it with Arab public opinion. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, who once covered the Middle East and frequently writes about the region, called it ""the broad mass of public opinion"" there in 2002, as distinct from extremist opinion, which he calls the ""Arab basement"". As of 2013, Collins English Dictionary defines ""the Arab street"" as an informal term for ""public opinion in the Arab world.""
Nevertheless, even as the term came into wide use, there was disagreement about its exact meaning. In 2002 a U.S. State Department official, reporting on a meeting between President George W. Bush and the leaders of Japan and Pakistan, said that the latter, Pervez Musha",politics
History of Abkhazia,"The history of Abkhazia, a region in the South Caucasus, spans more than 5,000 years from its settlement by the lower-paleolithic hunter-gatherers to its present status as a partially recognized state.

Prehistoric settlement
Lower Paleolithic hunting-gathering encampments formed the first known settlements on the territory of modern-day Abkhazia. The earliest examples have been unearthed at the sites of Iashkhtva, Gumista, Kelasuri, and Ochamchire. Upper Paleolithic culture settled chiefly on the coastline. Mesolithic and Neolithic periods brought larger permanent settlements and marked the beginning of farming, animal husbandry, and the production of ceramics. The earliest artifacts of megalithic culture appeared in the early 3rd millennium BC and continued into the Bronze Age as the so-called dolmens of Abkhazia, typically consisting of four upright mass stones and a capstone, some of them weighing as much as 50 tonnes. A dolmen from the Eshera archaeological site is the best-studied prehistoric monument of this type. The Late Bronze Age saw the development of more advanced bronze implements and continued into the Iron Age as a part of the Colchian culture (c. 1200-600 BCE), which covered most of what is now western Georgia and part of northeastern Anatolia.

Abkhazia in antiquity
The written history of Abkhazia largely begins with the coming of the Milesian Greeks to the coastal Colchis in the 6th-5th centuries BC. They founded their maritime colonies along the eastern shore of the Black Sea, with Dioscurias being one of the most important centers of trade. This city, said to be so named for the Dioscuri, the twins Castor and Pollux of classical mythology, is presumed to have subsequently developed into the modern-day Sukhumi. Other notable colonies were Gyenos, Triglitis, and later Pityus, arguably near the modern-day coastal towns of Ochamchire, Gagra, and Pitsunda, respectively.
The peoples of the region were notable for their number and variety, as classical sources testify. Herodotus, Strabo, and Pliny appreciate the multitude of languages spoken in Dioscurias and other towns. The mountainous terrain tended to separate and isolate local peoples from one another and encouraged the development of dozens of separate languages and dialects complicating the ethnic makeup of the region. Even the most well-informed contemporary authors are very confused when naming and locating these peoples and provide only very limited information about the geography and population of the hinterland. Furthermore, some classic ethnic names were presumably collective terms, and supposed considerable migrations also took place around the region. Various attempts have been made to identify these peoples with the ethnic terms employed by classical authors. Most scholars identify Pliny the Elder's Apsilae of the 1st century and Arrian’s Abasgoi of the 2nd century with the probable proto-Abkhaz- and Abaza-speakers respectively, while Georgian scholars consider them ",history

Cornish Bronze Age,"The Cornish Bronze Age is an era of the prehistory of Cornwall that spanned the period from c. 2400 BCE to c. 800 BCE. It was preceded by the Cornish Neolithic, and followed by the Cornish Iron Age. It is characterized by the introduction and widespread use of copper and copper-alloy (bronze) weapons and tools.
Significant social and economic changes occurred in Cornwall over the course of the Bronze Age. The earliest stage coincided with the arrival of the Bell Beaker culture, the adoption of new ceramic styles, innovations in ritual and funerary customs, and the earliest evidence for exploitation of local tin and gold resources. Throughout the Early Bronze Age, the main focus was on ritual activity and the construction of ceremonial monuments in the uplands, with the few known domestic buildings being relatively fragile and temporary structures. This changed in the Middle Bronze Age, with a decline in monument construction, the expansion of livestock and arable farming, and a pronounced increase in the number of settlements, which by this stage consisted of much more substantial roundhouses. At the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, there was an apparent abandonment of upland settlements, a change in lowland roundhouse construction technique, and a change in pottery style, suggesting increasing influence from South-Central Britain.
Cornwall was part of an extensive trade and cultural network from at least the Early Bronze Age, exchanging goods and ideas with the communities along the Atlantic Façade, the Wessex culture, and to a lesser extent more distant societies in Central Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. Trevisker Ware ceramics from Cornwall were transported to other parts of southern Britain, and the style was copied by potters in Ireland and Brittany. Cornwall was an important source for tin and gold in the Bronze Age, and is the most likely provenance for these metals in a substantial number of artefacts and semi-finished products found from this period in the rest of Britain, Ireland, Germany, and the Middle East.

Chronology
The Bronze Age is defined by the widespread adoption of bronze, an alloy of tin and copper which is found in Britain and Ireland from c. 2200–2100 BCE. The Bronze Age ends around the early to mid first millennium BCE, at which point ironworking is introduced, followed by a substantial decrease and eventual collapse in the production, circulation, and use of bronze tools and weapons and the beginning of the Iron Age. Bronze Age Britain and Ireland is usually dated to c. 2150–800 BCE, subdivided into Early Bronze Age (EBA, c. 2150–1600 BCE), Middle Bronze Age (MBA, c. 1600–1150 BCE) and Late Bronze Age (LBA, c. 1150-800/600 BCE). Recent reviews have tended to include the Chalcolithic ('copper-using', or 'Beaker') phase with the Early Bronze Age.
In 1986, Patricia Christie outlined a chronology of the Cornish Bronze Age based on Colin Burgess's thirteen industrial stages, but with different regional type-find name",history
Economic epidemiology,"Economic epidemiology is a field at the intersection of epidemiology and economics. Its premise is to incorporate incentives for healthy behavior and their attendant behavioral responses into an epidemiological context to better understand how diseases are transmitted. This framework should help improve policy responses to epidemic diseases by giving policymakers and health-care providers clear tools for thinking about how certain actions can influence the spread of disease transmission.
The main context through which this field emerged was the idea of prevalence-dependence, or disinhibition, which suggests that individuals change their behavior as the prevalence of a disease changes. However, economic epidemiology also encompasses other ideas, including the role of externalities, global disease commons and how individuals’ incentives can influence the outcome and cost of health interventions.
Strategic epidemiology is a branch of economic epidemiology that adopts an explicitly game theoretic approach to analyzing the interplay between individual behavior and population wide disease dynamics.

Prevalence-dependence
The spread of an infectious disease is a population-level phenomenon, but decisions to prevent or treat a disease are typically made by individuals who may change their behavior over the course of an epidemic, especially if their perception of risk changes depending on the available information on the epidemics  – their decisions will then have population-level consequences. For example, an individual may choose to have unsafe sex or a doctor may prescribe antibiotics to someone without a confirmed bacterial infection. In both cases, the choice may be rational from the individual's point of view but undesirable from a societal perspective.
Limiting the spread of disease at the population level requires changing individual behavior, which in turn depends on what information individuals have about the level of risk. When risk is low, people will tend to ignore it. However, if the risk of infection is higher, individuals are more likely to take preventive action. Moreover, the more transmissible the pathogen, the greater the incentive is to make personal investments for control.
The converse is also true: if there is a lowered risk of disease, either through vaccination or because of lowered prevalence, individuals may increase their risk-taking behavior. This effect is analogous to the introduction of safety regulations, such as seatbelts in cars, which because they reduce the cost of an accident in terms of expected injury and death, could lead people to drive with less caution and the resulting injuries to nonoccupants and increased nonfatal crashes may offset some of the gains from the use of seatbelts.
Prevalence-dependent behavior introduces a crucial difference with respect to the way individuals respond when the prevalence of a disease increases. If behavior is exogenous or if behavioral responses are assumed to be inelastic with ",economics

Social studies,"In many countries' curricula, social studies is the combined study of humanities, the arts, and social sciences, mainly including history, economics, and civics. The term was coined by American educators around the turn of the twentieth century as a catch-all for these subjects, as well as others which did not fit into the models of lower education in the United States such as philosophy and psychology. One of the purposes of social studies, particularly at the level of higher education, is to integrate several disciplines, with their unique methodologies and special focuses of concentration, into a coherent field of subject areas that communicate with each other by sharing different academic ""tools"" and perspectives for deeper analysis of social problems and issues. Social studies aims to train students for informed, responsible participation in a diverse democratic society. It provides the necessary background knowledge in order to develop values and reasoned opinions, and the objective of the field is civic competence. A related term is humanities, arts, and social sciences, abbreviated HASS.

Branches of social studies
Social studies is not a subject unto itself, instead functioning as a field of study that incorporates many different subjects. It primarily includes the subjects of history, economics, and civics. Through all of that, the elements of geography, sociology, ethics, psychology, philosophy, anthropology, art and literature are incorporated into the subject field itself. The field of study itself focuses on human beings and their respective relationships. With that, many of these subjects include some form of social utility that is beneficial to the subject field itself. The whole field is rarely taught; typically, a few subjects combined are taught. Recognition of the field has, arguably, lessened the significance of history, with the exception of U.S. History. Initially, only History and Civics were significant parts of the high school curriculum; eventually, Economics became a significant part of the high school curriculum, as well. While History and Civics were already established, the significance of Economics in the high school curriculum is more recent. History and Civics are similar in many ways, though they differ in class activity. There was some division between scholars on the topic of merging the subjects, though it was agreed that presenting a full picture of the world to students was extremely important.

College level
Social studies as a college major or concentration remains uncommon, although such a degree is offered at Harvard University. Harvard first introduced social studies as a formal field of study in 1960, through the work of a committee led by Stanley Hoffman, and today known as the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, guitarist Tom Morello, and theater director Diana Paulus all concentrated in social studies during their time at Harvard.

Imagination Age,"The Imagination Age is a theorized period following the Information Age where creativity and imagination become the primary creators of economic value (in contrast, the main activities of the Information Age were analysis and rational thought). It has been proposed that new technologies like virtual reality and user created content will change the way humans interact with each other and create economic and social structures.
The AI boom of the 2020s has increased the ubiquity of information. The relevant neologism is the Fourth Industrial Revolution, popularized in 2016 based on transformative developments shifting the nature of industrial capitalism.
One conception is that the rise of an immersive virtual reality (the metaverse or the cyberspace) will raise the value of ""imagination work"" done by designers, artists, et cetera, over rational thinking as a foundation of culture and economics.

Origins of the term
The terms Imagination Age as well as Age of Imagination were first introduced in an essay by designer and writer Charlie Magee in 1993. His essay, ""The Age of Imagination: Coming Soon to a Civilization Near You"" proposes the idea that the best way to assess the evolution of human civilization is through the lens of communication.

The most successful groups throughout human history have had one thing in common: when compared to their competition they had the best system of communication. The fittest communicators—whether tribe, citystate, kingdom, corporation, or nation—had (1) a larger percentage of people with (2) access to (3) higher quality information, (4) a greater ability to transform that information into knowledge and action, (5) and more freedom to communicate that new knowledge to the other members of their group.
Imagination Age, as a philosophical tenet heralding a new wave of cultural and economic innovation, appears to have been first introduced by artist, writer and cultural critic Rita J. King in November 2007 essay for the British Council entitled, ""The Emergence of a New Global Culture in the Imagination Age"", where she began using the phrase, ""Toward a New Global Culture and Economy in the Imagination Age"":Rather than exist as an unwitting victim of circumstance, all too often unaware of the impact of having been born in a certain place at a certain time, to parents firmly nestled within particular values and socioeconomic brackets, millions of people are creating new virtual identities and meaningful relationships with others who would have remained strangers, each isolated within their respective realities.
King further refined the development of her thinking in a 2008 Paris essay entitled, ""Our Vision for Sustainable Culture in the Imagination Age"" in which she states,

Active participants in the Imagination Age are becoming cultural ambassadors by introducing virtual strangers to unfamiliar customs, costumes, traditions, rituals and beliefs, which humanizes foreign cultures, contributes to a sense of belonging to o",history

Handball,"Handball (also known as team handball, European handball, Olympic handball or indoor handball) is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each (six outcourt players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the opposing team. A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.
Modern handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 metres (131 by 66 ft), with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a 6-metre (20 ft) zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while ""diving"" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball, Czech handball (which were more common in the past) and beach handball. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Body contact is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft protective bands, pads and mouth guards.
The modern set of rules was published in 1917 by Karl Schelenz, Max Heiser, and Erich Konigh, on 29 October in Berlin, which is seen as the date of birth of the sport. The rules have had several revisions since. The first official handball match was played in 1917 in Germany. Karl Schelenz modified the rules in 1919. The first international games were played (under these rules) with men in 1925 (between Germany and Belgium) and with women in 1930 (between Germany and Austria).
Men's handball was first played at the Olympics in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin outdoors, and the next time at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich indoors; handball has been an Olympic sport since then. Women's handball was added at the 1976 Summer Olympics.
The International Handball Federation was formed in 1946 and, as of 2016, has 197 member federations. The sport is most popular in Europe, and European countries have won all medals but one in the men's world championships since 1938. In the women's world championships, only two non-European countries have won the title: South Korea and Brazil. The game also enjoys popularity in East Asia, North Africa and parts of South America.

Origins and development
Games similar to handball were played in Ancient Greece and are represented on amphorae and stone carvings. Although detailed textual reference is rare, there are numerous descriptions of ball games being played where players throw the ball to one another; sometimes this is done in order to avoid interception by a player on the opposing team. Such games were played widely and served as both a form of exercise and a social event.
There is evidence of ancient Roman women playing a version of handball called expulsim ludere. There are records of handball-like games in",sports
Middle Ages,"In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted approximately from the 5th to the late 15th centuries, similarly to the post-classical period of global history. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and transitioned into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.
Population decline, counterurbanisation, the collapse of centralised authority, invasions, and mass migrations of tribes, which had begun in late antiquity, continued into the Early Middle Ages. The large-scale movements of the Migration Period, including various Germanic peoples, formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century, North Africa and the Middle East—once part of the Byzantine Empire—came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate, an Islamic empire, after conquest by Muhammad's successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with classical antiquity was incomplete. The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire, Rome's direct continuation, survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the Corpus Juris Civilis or ""Code of Justinian"", was rediscovered in Northern Italy in the 11th century. In the West, most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions. Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise the remaining pagans across Europe continued. The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, briefly established the Carolingian Empire during the later 8th and early 9th centuries. It covered much of Western Europe but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions: Vikings from the north, Magyars from the east, and Saracens from the south.
During the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased significantly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages.
This period also saw the collapse of the unified Christian church with the East–West Schism of 1054. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation-states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholast",history
Economics of nuclear power plants,"Nuclear power construction costs have varied significantly across the world and over time. Large and rapid increases in costs occurred during the 1970s, especially in the United States. Recent cost trends in countries such as Japan and Korea have been very different, including periods of stability and decline in construction costs.
New nuclear power plants typically have high capital expenditure for building plants. Fuel, operational, and maintenance costs are relatively small components of the total cost. The long service life and high capacity factor of nuclear power plants allow sufficient funds for ultimate plant decommissioning and waste storage and management to be accumulated, with little impact on the price per unit of electricity generated. Additionally, measures to mitigate climate change such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading, favor the economics of nuclear power over fossil fuel power. Nuclear power is cost competitive with the renewable generation when the capital cost is between $2000 and $3000/kW.

Overview
The economics of nuclear power are debated. Some opponents of nuclear power cite cost as the main challenge for the technology.  Ian Lowe has also challenged the economics of nuclear power. 
Nuclear supporters point to the historical success of nuclear power across the world, and they call for new reactors in their own countries, including proposed new but largely uncommercialized designs, as a source of new power. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) while endorsing nuclear technology as a low carbon, mature energy source (addressing greenhouse gas emissions), notes that nuclear's share of global generation has been in decline for over 30 years, listing barriers such as operational risks, uranium mining risks, financial and regulatory risks, unresolved waste management issues, nuclear weapon proliferation concerns, and adverse public opinion.
Solar power has very low capacity factors compared to nuclear, and solar power can only achieve so much market penetration before (expensive) energy storage and transmission become necessary. This is because nuclear power ""requires less maintenance and is designed to operate for longer stretches before refueling"" while solar power is in a constant state of refueling and is limited by a lack of fuel that requires a backup power source that works on a larger scale.
In the United States, nuclear power faces competition from the low natural gas prices in North America. Former Exelon CEO John Rowe said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the United States ""don’t make any sense right now"" and won't be economic as long as the natural gas surplus persists.
The price of new plants in China is lower than in the Western world.
In 2016, the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, directed the New York Public Service Commission to consider ratepayer-financed subsidies similar to those for renewable sources to keep nuclear power stations (which accounted for one third of the state's",economics
Moose biathlon,"Moose biathlon (Finnish: Hirvenhiihto) is a winter sport variation of biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing, range estimation of paper targets resembling a moose, and rifle shooting using fullbore biathlon rifles. The Finnish Hunters' Association holds competitions, which were first developed in Finland in the 1970s. Today, competitions are held in Finland and Sweden with a goal of becoming a Nordic discipline. There are over 10,000 competitors in Sweden and Finland, with over 600 competitors participating in the yearly Finnish Championship.
The skiing event is performed in classic style over a distance of 7–9 kilometres (4.3–5.6 mi), while competitors carry the rifle. However, competitors under the age of 16 are not required to carry the rifle themselves. Range estimation and shooting take place at designated spots along the ski course. The shooting component consists of ten rounds fired from a standing position at a distance of 100 metres (330 ft). The rifle must comply with legal requirements for hunting moose. During the range estimation component, competitors must judge the distance to two moose figures placed somewhere between 50 and 200 metres (160 and 660 ft).
The winner of the Moose Biathlon is determined by a point system, with a maximum of 1200 points available throughout the competition. The shooting component awards up to 600 points, calculated by multiplying the target scores by six. The range estimation component has 300 points available, with two points deducted for each meter of error. The skiing component awards the fastest competitor 300 points, with other competitors receiving points based on how far behind the fastest skier they finish. One point is deducted per 10 seconds. For example, if a competitor finishes 50 seconds behind the fastest skier, they are awarded 295 points from the skiing component of the competition. In most races, the oldest competitors receive full skiing points to avoid life-threatening illnesses.
A relay race version of Moose Biathlon exists, where each team member fires five rounds at a moose target and estimates the range of only one moose figure instead of two. Penalties apply for missed shots or errors in range estimation.
In contrast, Moose Shooting with Running (Finnish: Hirvenjuoksu) is a summer variation of Moose Biathlon where skiing is replaced with a 4–5 kilometres (2.5–3.1 mi) run. Firearms are not carried during the run but are instead placed in a rack near the shooting location.

Factitious airs,"Factitious airs was a term used for synthetic gases which emerged around 1670 when Robert Boyle coined the term upon isolating what is now understood to be hydrogen. Factitious means ""artificial, not natural"", so the term means ""man-made gases"".

Background
Robert Boyle coined the term Factitious Air upon isolating hydrogen in 1670. Henry Cavendish (1731–1810) used the term ""factitious air"" to refer to ""any kind of air which is contained in other bodies in an unelastic state, and is produced from thence by art"".
An archaic definition from 1747  for the production of factitious air was defined as being caused by: ""1- by flow Degrees from Putrefactions and Fermentations of all Kinds; or 2- more expeditiously by some Sorts of chymical Dissolutions of Bodies; or 3- and lastly, almost instantaneously by the Explosion of Gunpowder, and the Mixture or some Kinds of Bodies. Thus, if Paste or Dough with Leaven be placed in an exhausted Receiver, it will, after some Time, by Fermentation, produce a considerable quantity of Air, which will appear very plainly by the Sinking the Quicksilver in the Gage. Thus also any Animal or Vegetable Substance, putrifying in Vacuo, will produce the same Effect.""
There are significant inconsistencies in the archaic nomenclature due to the limited knowledge of chemistry and primitive analytical technology of the era (i.e. based on the chemistry, it is clear the terms were mistakenly assigned to more than one gas by different investigators). Furthermore, in most cases the gases were not pure.

Factitious Airs
Names used for factitious airs may have included:

Ammonia
ammonical gas
ammoniac
volatile alkali
alkaline air
gaseous ammonia
azoturetted hydrogen

Carbon Dioxide
Fixed Air
Source:
Fixed air, or fixible air, is an ancient term for carbon dioxide
Joseph Priestley credited Joseph Black for discovering and coining ""fixed air"", which was thought to exist in a fixed state in alkaline salts, chalk, and other calcareous substances. Black considered substances containing fixed air to be ""mild"", and upon expulsion of the gas by heating the resulting state is ""caustic"" by corroding or burning plants and animals (e.g. CO2 released by chalk upon decomposition to calcium oxide). In other words, the fixed air (also known as fixible air) was thought to be fixated within a corrosive molecule.
Priestley likewise credited the discovery of fixed air to contributions from several scientists including: David Macbride, John Pringle, William Brownrigg (regarded carbonated water to have an acidulous taste), Stephen Hales, and many others.
Henry Cavendish provided a definition: ""By fixed air, I mean that particular species of factitious air, which is separated from alkaline substances by solution in acids or by calcination"". Cavendish essentially defined potassium oxide or calcium oxide as a base, which can contain a fixated air within its composition, setting the stage for the historical definition of carbonate.

Chilean rodeo,"Rodeo is a traditional equestrian sport in Chile, declared the national sport in 1962.
Chilean rodeo is different from the rodeo found in North America.  
The sport, in its modern form, is strictly regulated. Chilean Horses are used exclusively and riders are required to wear traditional huaso clothing.  Rancagua hosts the annual Campeonato Nacional de Rodeo, the nationwide rodeo championship. The greatest rider in the sport's history is considered to be Ramón Cardemil, who won the national title seven times; the last champions were Juan Carlos Loaiza and Eduardo Tamayo Órdenes. Riders practice in the countryside throughout Chile, but the sport is most popular in the central zone. Even so, huasos have been known to travel hundreds of miles to compete in competitions.
In 2004, more spectators attended rodeo events than professional football matches.
Currently, rodeo is one of the most played sports in Chile, some sources argue only second to soccer. The Chilean Rodeo developed in rural areas all over the country, most prominently in the central area, where there is a rural demographic. However, the location of the most notable sites of play, called medialunas, are in large cities in Chile. This shift is because of the expansion of the rodeo in the middle of the twentieth century.

Description
The game consists of a horse collar, composed of two huasos and two horses, who must stop a young bull within three chances to receive different scores.
Rodeos are held inside circular enclosures called rodeo rings. There are two skills in the event. Firstly, cow runs and the movement of the reins, this being the most popular, where the objective is to horse collar – using two huasos (skilled horse riders) mounted on Chilean horses – a herd using a steer of thatch. The second aim is to pass eight equestrian tests.
The highest scoring move is the flank save which earns four points, then the free paddle save which is worth three points, and finally the paddle save which earns two points. Players can have points deducted if the riders cut across or pass the ring.
Currently, the sport is governed by strict regulation that, among other rules, says only registered Chilean horses can compete, ridden by huasos in uniform. The official season begins in September and lasts until April, with around 320 rodeos throughout Chile. The season ends with the National Championship of the Chilean Rodeo, taking place each year in the rodeo ring Medialuna Monumental de Rancagua and attended by the best riders and horses qualifying during the season.

History
The game's origins go back to Imperial Spain's colonial era (1598–1810), as part of traditional Chilean peasant festivals.

Establishment
The birth of the Chilean Rodeo dates back to the sixteenth century during the rule of Governor García Hurtado de Mendoza, a cavalry officer trained in the play and administration of skill games. He was also an admirer of Moorish equestrian art. In those years the cattle in Chile were not wel",sports

Chattering classes,"The chattering classes is a politically active, socially concerned and highly educated section of the ""metropolitan middle class"", especially those with political, media, and academic connections. It is a generally derogatory term, often used by pundits and political commentators.

United Kingdom
It is sometimes used to refer to a liberal elite, but its first use by British journalist Frank Johnson in 1980 appeared to include a wider range of pundits. Indeed, the term is used by people all across the political spectrum to refer to the journalists and political operatives who see themselves as the arbiters of conventional wisdom. As such, the notion of ""chattering classes"" can be seen as an antonym to the older idea of an unrepresented silent majority, made notable by the U.S. Republican Party President Richard Nixon.

United States
In the United States, the term has come to be used by both the left and right and to describe political opponents, with Stephen Perrault of the Merriam-Webster dictionary suggesting that the term has ""connotations of idleness, of useless talk, that the noun 'chatter' does. ... These people don't amount to much—they like to hear themselves talk.""

Geoeconomics,"Geoeconomics (sometimes geo-economics) is the study of the spatial, temporal, and political aspects of economies and resources. Although there is no widely accepted singular definition, the distinction of geoeconomics separately from geopolitics is often attributed to Edward Luttwak, an American strategist and military consultant, and Pascal Lorot, a French economist and political scientist.
The Singapore Economic Forum has emphasized the increasingly dynamic, complex aspects of leaders' decisions in the “Age of Geoeconomics”. Policy makers and CEOs alike have to ""assess constantly techno-economic returns and legal-political risks on a combined geoeconomic plane."" Azerbaijani economist Vusal Gasimli defines geo-economics as the study of the interrelations of economics, geography and politics in the ""infinite cone"" rising from the center of the earth to outer space (including the economic analysis of planetary resources).
In Geopolitics, a common approach involves three levels of analysis. Geoeconomics can employ this three-layer approach as well. There is a policy layer, as in international political economy; an integration layer, as in economic geography and industrial organization; and a transaction layer, as in the transactions exemplified in financial economics.

""The logic of conflict in the grammar of commerce""
Luttwak argues that the same logic that underlies military conflict also pertains to international commerce:

States seek to collect as much in revenue as their fiscal codes prescribe and are not content to let other states tax commercial activity in the former's purview. This is a zero-sum game.
States predominantly regulate economic activity to maximize outcomes within their own borders, rather than for a disinterested transnational purpose, even when the outcome is suboptimal for other states. The logic of state regulation then conforms, in part, to logic of conflict.
States and blocs of states strive to restrict their payouts and services to their own residents. Moreover, states design their infrastructure projects to optimize domestic utility, regardless of how other states are affected, as opposed to the transnational utility.
States or blocs of states promote technological innovation to maximize benefits within their own boundaries, rather than for the sake of innovation itself.

Geoeconomics vs. geopolitics
There is not yet an authoritative definition of geoeconomics that is clearly distinct from geopolitics. The challenge of separating geopolitics and geoeconomics into separate spheres is due to their interdependence: interactions among nation-states as indivisible sovereign units exercising political power, and the predominance of neoclassical economics' ""logic of commerce"" that ostensibly separates market dynamics from political power. The following descriptions of geoeconomics indicate the challenge of distinguishing it from the field of geopolitics:

Chatham House: ""the use of economic tools to advance geopolitical objec",economics
Black advance,"The term black advance is used by political strategists to refer to an attempt to disrupt the advance operations of political opponents during an election campaign.
Notable examples have included the theft of speeches, break-ins of offices to secure political information, infiltration of advance staff working a particular event, disinformation campaigns to cause lower attendance at rallies, and disrupting rallies through various means.

Notable Examples
In a California senatorial race, a university student named Dick Tuck was given the task of being the local ""advance"" person for a Richard Nixon speech, even though Tuck worked for the Helen Gahagan Douglas campaign. Tuck accepted the job and proceeded to book a huge auditorium, invite only a handful of people, stalled for a lot of time with a long-winded introduction, and informed the crowd Nixon would speak on the International Monetary Fund, which Nixon did not know much about.
At the end of the rally, Nixon asked Tuck what his name was, then said, ""Dick Tuck, you've made your last advance.""  Tuck became legendary for what amounted to diligent, low-grade obstruction of Nixon's campaign.  In one instance, he switched the signs on two different buses, one labeled ""Nixon"" and one labeled ""VIP's."" The switch caused Nixon to be delivered to a hotel rather than a live television appearance.
In another case, Tuck interfered with a ""photo-op,"" by commissioning new signage in Chinese to accompany some ""Welcome Nixon"" signs at a Chinatown, San Francisco, rally.  Tuck's signs read, in Chinese, ""What about the huge loan?"" in a reference to a loan that Howard Hughes had made to Nixon's brother Donald.  Tuck was reportedly dismayed that  ""huge"" was the closest the Chinese characters could come to spelling out the word ""Hughes.""

Obshchestvovedeniye,"Obshestvovédeny or Obshchestvovédeniye (Russian: Обществоведение) is a social science and eponymous academic subject in a Soviet school. As a subject, it was taught from the 1960s to 1991 throughout the USSR and covered all the three constituent parts of Marxism–Leninism. These component parts of Marxism, according to Lenin and his Soviet adherents, are Marxist-Leninist philosophy (dialectical and historical materialism), political economy, and scientific communism.

Overview
Soviet Union
For the first time the school program was approved by the People's Commissariat for Education in 1925. The peculiarity of the subject was to develop a system of views on the world among students of secondary schools, covering all the phenomena occurring in it and giving students a unified understanding and explanation of these phenomena through the prism of Marxist-Leninist philosophy (In other words, the subject was also a complex of social Sciences, but from a Marxist point of view). In the USSR education system, social studies was a mandatory course for all senior-class secondary-school students and represented the world as Soviet officials wanted their young people to see and understand it.  In order to indoctrinate students about Communism, the course contained ""much distortion, half-truth, and deliberate falsification."": b  The Soviet textbook of social studies included:

1. Dialectical and historical materialism — the basis of the scientific worldview.
2. Socialism — the first phase of Communist society.
3. The Communist party — the leading and guiding force of Soviet society.
4. Ways of gradual development of socialism into communism.
5. XX century — the century of the triumph of communism.

Russia
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in the Russian school and CIS schools since 1992 the subject was canceled. The factual information previously contained in the subject began to be taught within the framework of history.
Since 2000, the subject has been returned to secondary school as a complex of Sciences, including: philosophy, sociology, social psychology, law, economics and political science.
As an independent educational subject has been preserved in Belarus.

Algorithmic radicalization,"Algorithmic radicalization is the concept that recommender algorithms on popular social media sites such as YouTube and Facebook drive users toward progressively more extreme content over time, leading to them developing radicalized extremist political views. Algorithms record user interactions, from likes/dislikes to amount of time spent on posts, to generate endless media aimed to keep users engaged. Through echo chamber channels, the consumer is driven to be more polarized through preferences in media and self-confirmation.
Algorithmic radicalization remains a controversial phenomenon as it is often not in the best interest of social media companies to remove echo chamber channels. To what extent recommender algorithms are actually responsible for radicalization remains disputed; studies have found contradictory results as to whether algorithms have promoted extremist content.

Social media echo chambers and filter bubbles
Social media platforms learn the interests and likes of the user to modify their experiences in their feed to keep them engaged and scrolling, known as a filter bubble. An echo chamber is formed when users come across beliefs that magnify or reinforce their thoughts and form a group of like-minded users in a closed system. Echo chambers spread information without any opposing beliefs and can possibly lead to confirmation bias. According to group polarization theory, an echo chamber can potentially lead users and groups towards more extreme radicalized positions. According to the National Library of Medicine, ""Users online tend to prefer information adhering to their worldviews, ignore dissenting information, and form polarized groups around shared narratives. Furthermore, when polarization is high, misinformation quickly proliferates.""

On May 14, 2022, 18-year old Payton S. Gendron carried out a mass-shooting in Buffalo, New York. The shooter stated in his manifesto that the internet was the source of his radical beliefs: ""There was little to no influence on my personal beliefs by people I met in person.""
Around March 19, 2024, a New York state judge ruled Reddit and YouTube must face lawsuits in connection with the mass shooting over accusations that they played a role in the radicalization of the shooter.

Facebook
Facebook's algorithm focuses on recommending content that makes the user want to interact. They rank content by prioritizing popular posts by friends, viral content, and sometimes divisive content. Each feed is personalized to the user's specific interests which can sometimes lead users towards an echo chamber of troublesome content. Users can find their list of interests the algorithm uses by going to the ""Your ad Preferences"" page. According to a Pew Research study, 74% of Facebook users did not know that list existed until they were directed towards that page in the study.

History of agricultural science,"The history of agricultural science is a sub-field of the history of agriculture which looks at the scientific advancement of techniques and understanding of agriculture. Early study of organic production in botanical gardens was continued in with agricultural experiment stations in several countries.
Fertilizer is a major contribution to agriculture history increasing the fertility of the soil and minimizing nutrient loss. Scientific study of fertilizer was advanced significantly in 1840 with the publication Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agrikulturchemie und Physiologie (Organic Chemistry in Its Applications to Agriculture and Physiology) by Justus von Liebig. One of Liebig's advances in agricultural science was the discovery of nitrogen as an essential plant nutrient.

Fertilizer
The first method of soil nourishment utilized compost. Composting used rotten organic materials to replenish the soil of its nutrients and dates back to tenth and twelfth century Arab writings. Composting was a normal and widely used practice of fertilization, up into the twentieth century.
Johann Friedrich Mayer was the first scientist to publish experiments on the use of gypsum as a fertilizer, but the mechanism that made it function as a fertilizer was contested by his contemporaries.
Agricultural science developed when analytical chemistry began to address organic compounds. Fertilization with decomposed plants sometimes gave a whiff of ammonia, which suggested a role for nitrogen in biological growth. Gerardus Mulder tried to determine the chemical formula for albumin and similar biological substances, but Justus von Liebig is usually cited as the early visionary of protein structure. For instance, he assigned his student Eben Horsford  the task of comparing the nitrogen content of grains. More significantly, Liebig analysed biological growth as constrained by limiting factors such as a shortage of phosphorus, potassium or nitrogen. His view is called Liebig's law of the minimum. As the nineteenth century progressed so did soil science and its promulgation by farm journals such as those published by Luther Tucker.
The production of synthetic ammonia was acquired by Fritz Haber and Carl Bosh. Haber discovered the reaction process to produce ammonia and Bosh was able to pressurize it to complete the process. Together Haber and Bosch came up with the Haber-Bosch process that fixated nitrogen to produce ammonia that is used in most fertilizers. In 1918 Fritz Haber received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the invention of this process. Carl Bosch also received a Nobel Prize in 1918, but for high-pressure studies. Without the pressure studies this process wouldn't be possible.
In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the Hatch Act of 1887, which used the term ""agricultural science"". The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. Later on, the Smith–Hughes Act of 1917 ",science
List of tram accidents,"This is a worldwide list of accidents involving trams (or streetcars in U.S. English) in which there was significant damage to the tramcar, or involving severe injury or death to those in the tramcar.  Pedestrian fatalities are outside the scope of this list.

Argentina
On 12 July 1930, electric tram no. 75 on Line 105 travelling from Temperley to Lanús in Greater Buenos Aires, Argentina, plunged into the Matanza River when the driver attempted to cross the Bosch Bridge without realising that the central bascule was raised. 56 out of 60 passengers died and only 4 survived, making this the deadliest tram accident anywhere in the world.

Australia
In January 1864, well-known Anglo-Australian musician and composer Isaac Nathan was hit and killed by a Sydney horse tram when his clothing was caught in the door, whilst he was attempting to alight. Nathan is reputed to be one of the first tram fatalities in the Southern Hemisphere (many sources claim that it was the first such accident).
On 28 September 1913, a Rockhampton steam tram and its trailer capsized on a sharp bend while returning from the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens resulting in three fatalities.  One man died instantly, while two women later died from their injuries in hospital.
On 21 August 1924, a coupled set of Sydney tram E-class cars ran out of control near McMahon's Point, derailed and crashed into a house.  There were two fatalities, and the trams were extensively damaged.
On 22 May 2017, a Melbourne tram was hit by a truck in Parkville, hospitalising 14.

Austria
On 2 August 1960, a tram ran away in Vienna, Austria and collided with another at a crossroads. Eighteen people were killed and 104 were injured.
On 21 April 2015, twelve people were injured after two trams collided in Vienna.

Hawaiian lava sledding,"Hawaiian lava sledding  (Hawaiian: heʻe hōlua, ""sled surfing"") is a traditional sport of the Native Hawaiians.  Similar to wave surfing, heʻe hōlua involves the use of a narrow (12 ft or 3.7 m long, 6 in or 15 cm wide) wooden sled (papa hōlua).  The sled is used standing up, lying down, or kneeling, to ride down man-made or naturally occurring courses (kahua hōlua) of rock, often reaching speeds of 50 mph (80 km/h) or greater.  In the past, Hawaiian lava sledding was considered both a sport and a religious ritual for honoring the gods.

Sleds
Papa hōlua are composed of a pair of runners and a superstructure (platform). The runners are made from hard native woods, traditionally that of kauila (Alphitonia ponderosa or Colubrina oppositifolia), uhiuhi (Caesalpinia kavaiensis), or māmane (Sophora chrysophylla).  The runners have up-curved fore edges, straight aft edges, and rounded lower edges. Crosspieces keep the runners apart.  The superstructure, two rails smaller in diameter than the runners and spaced apart by pieces of bamboo, sits on top of the crosspieces. The runners, crosspieces, and rails are bound together with sennit cordage.  The rails are wrapped in white kapa cloth and the rail frame is covered in lauhala matting. Oil from kukui (Aleurites moluccana) nuts coats either the course or the runners to provide lubrication.

Courses
A kahua hōlua foundation, which is made of rocks, is built in a depression on a hillside. The foundation is covered in packed-in dirt and an outer layer of pili grass (Heteropogon contortus) or kō (Saccharum officinarum) flower tassels.  Courses are wide enough for a single sled and are not sloped at the bottom.  A skilled rider can travel 150–200 yd (140–180 m) on the course, reaching the flat portion.

Advocacy group,"Advocacy groups, also known as lobby groups, interest groups, special interest groups, pressure groups, or public associations, use various forms of advocacy or lobbying to influence public opinion and ultimately public policy. They play an important role in the development of political and social systems.
Motives for action may be based on political, economic, religious, moral, commercial or common good-based positions. Groups use varied methods to try to achieve their aims, including lobbying, media campaigns, awareness raising publicity stunts, polls, research, and policy briefings. Some groups are supported or backed by powerful business or political interests and exert considerable influence on the political process, while others have few or no such resources.
Some have developed into important social, and political institutions or social movements. Some powerful advocacy groups have been accused of manipulating the democratic system for narrow commercial gain, and in some instances have been found guilty of corruption, fraud, bribery, influence peddling and other serious crimes. Some groups, generally the ones with less financial resources, may use direct action and civil disobedience, and in some cases are accused of being a threat to the social order or ""domestic extremists"". Research is beginning to explore how advocacy groups use social media to facilitate civic engagement, and collective action.

History in Great Britain
Beginnings
The early growth of pressure groups was connected to broad economic and political changes in England in the mid-18th century, including political representation, market capitalization, and proletarianization. The first mass social movement catalyzed around the controversial political figure, John Wilkes. As editor of the paper The North Briton, Wilkes vigorously attacked the new administration of Lord Bute and the peace terms that the new government accepted at the 1763 Treaty of Paris at the end of the Seven Years' War. Charged with seditious libel, Wilkes was arrested after the issue of a general warrant, a move that Wilkes denounced as unlawful – the Lord Chief Justice eventually ruled in Wilkes favour. As a result of this episode, Wilkes became a figurehead to the growing movement for popular sovereignty among the middle classes – people began chanting, ""Wilkes and Liberty"" in the streets.
After a later period of exile, brought about by further charges of libel and obscenity, Wilkes stood for the Parliamentary seat at Middlesex, where most of his support was located. When Wilkes was imprisoned in the King's Bench Prison on 10 May 1768, a mass movement of support emerged, with large demonstrations in the streets under the slogan ""No liberty, no King."" Stripped of the right to sit in Parliament, Wilkes became an Alderman of London in 1769, and an activist group called the Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights began aggressively promoting his policies. This was the first ever sustained social adv",politics
History of Sacavém,"The history of Sacavém is the history of a town that, due to its strategic location —at the crossroads of the roads leading to Lisbon from the north and east— has been present in almost all the key dates of Portuguese history. Sacavém is a freguesia belonging to the municipality of Loures, very close to the municipality of Lisbon, crossed by the Trancão river and bordered to the south by the Mar da Palha.
It is a very ancient population, existing in Roman times a bridge that survived, at least, until the 16th century (according to Francisco de Holanda). From the time of the Moorish occupation remained, apparently, the toponym of Arab origin (شقبان, Šaqabān); immediately after the siege and subsequent conquest of Lisbon by the Christians in 1147, it seems that a battle took place in this locality (the Battle of the River Sacavém), although today it is considered legendary.
During the Middle Ages, Sacavém was a royal manor, whose beneficiaries were the admiral Manuel Pessanha, the queen Dª Leonor Teles and later the constable Nuno Álvares Pereira. After the latter's death, the property passed to the House of Bragança, under whose rule it would remain until the Revolution of October 5, 1910 and the proclamation of the Portuguese Republic.
Severely damaged by the earthquake of 1755, Sacavém began a slow decline that lasted for about a century, until 1850, when its industrialisation began —with the creation of the famous Sacavém tile factory, which spread the name of the city throughout the country and abroad— as well as the construction of the railroad. This situation contributed to a population increase until the mid-70s of the 20th century, which also favored the development of several associations and sports clubs.
At the end of the 80's, the parish obtained its current geographical configuration, with the separation of Portela de Sacavém and Prior Velho. On June 4, 1997, Sacavém finally saw all its potential value recognized, being elevated to the category of town. Months later, the Vasco da Gama Bridge was inaugurated, connecting the city to Montijo, becoming a landmark in the city's urban landscape.

Prehistory, Roman and Germanic rule
Neolithic / Copper Age
Human presence in the Sacavém region has been proven for several centuries. About this, Pinho Leal wrote in his monumental work Portugal Antigo e Moderno (Ancient and Modern Portugal):""Sacavém is undoubtedly a very ancient population, and already existed in Roman times.""In fact, it seems to have been occupied already in prehistoric times (during the Neolithic period and, most probably, during the Copper Age, from when there seem to date three polished stone axes); there is news of the existence of a cave under the Largo do Terreirinho, next to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Health, which, when excavated during the 80's of the 20th century revealed the existence of prehistoric vestiges.

Internet censorship and surveillance
There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without judicial oversight.
The law provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government and elected officials generally respect these rights in practice. The independent media are active and express a wide variety of views without restriction. However, there have been incidents of local officials harassing or threatening journalists and others who criticized the government. Journalists complain about defamation lawsuits that the government threatens or files against the press for statements made about public officials or private figures in the public arena.
Defamation carries both criminal and civil penalties. Some journalists practice self-censorship on stories related to drug trafficking or allegations of business and political corruption, likely due to past patterns of retribution against activists and journalists engaged in investigative reporting. The law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, but the government does not always respect these prohibitions in practice.

Positivism,"Positivism is a philosophical school that holds that all genuine knowledge is either true by definition or positive – meaning a posteriori facts derived by reason and logic from sensory experience. Other ways of knowing, such as intuition, introspection, or religious faith, are rejected or considered meaningless.
Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought, modern positivism was first articulated in the early 19th century by Auguste Comte. His school of sociological positivism holds that society, like the physical world, operates according to scientific laws. After Comte, positivist schools arose in logic, psychology, economics, historiography, and other fields of thought. Generally, positivists attempted to introduce scientific methods to their respective fields. Since the turn of the 20th century, positivism, although still popular, has declined under criticism within the social sciences by antipositivists and critical theorists, among others, for its alleged scientism, reductionism, overgeneralizations, and methodological limitations. Positivism also exerted an unusual influence on Kardecism.

Etymology
The English noun positivism in this meaning was imported in the 19th century from the French word positivisme, derived from positif in its philosophical sense of 'imposed on the mind by experience'. The corresponding adjective (Latin: positivus) has been used in a similar sense to discuss law (positive law compared to natural law) since the time of Chaucer.

Background
Kieran Egan argues that positivism can be traced to the philosophy side of what Plato described as the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, later reformulated by Wilhelm Dilthey as a quarrel between the natural sciences (German: Naturwissenschaften) and the human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften).
In the early nineteenth century, massive advances in the natural sciences encouraged philosophers to apply scientific methods to other fields. Thinkers such as Henri de Saint-Simon, Pierre-Simon Laplace and Auguste Comte believed that the scientific method, the circular dependence of theory and observation, must replace metaphysics in the history of thought.

Positivism in the social sciences
Comte's positivism
Auguste Comte (1798–1857) first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in The Course in Positive Philosophy, a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed in 1844 by A General View of Positivism (published in French 1848, English in 1865). The first three volumes of the Course dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasized the inevitable coming of social science. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. For him, the phy",science
Modified vaccinia Ankara,"Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is an attenuated (weakened) strain of the vaccinia virus. It is being used as a vaccine (called MVA-BN, brand names: Imvanex in the EU, Imvamune in Canada, and Jynneos in the US) against smallpox and mpox, having fewer side effects than smallpox vaccines derived from other poxviruses. 
This third-generation smallpox vaccine has the advantage that it cannot reproduce complete virions in human cells, ""the block of the MVA life cycle occurs at the step of virion assembly resulting in assembly of immature virus particles that are not released from the infected cell.""
By inserting antigen genes into its genome, modified vaccinia Ankara virus is also used as an experimental viral vector for vaccines against non-poxvirus diseases.

Development as a poxvirus vaccine
The traditional smallpox vaccine, which was used in the smallpox eradication campaign 1958–1977, consists of a live vaccinia virus which can replicate in humans but usually does not cause disease. It can however sometimes lead to serious side effects. Modified vaccinia Ankara virus is a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus that was developed in Munich, Germany between 1953 and 1968. It was produced by more than 500 serial passages of vaccinia virus (from a wild strain discovered by the Turkish vaccine institute of Ankara) in chicken embryo fibroblasts. After testing the safety and effectiveness as a vaccine, it was approved in Germany in 1977, and then given to about 120,000 people until 1980, when smallpox vaccinations ended in Germany. No severe adverse events were seen during this time.
It was later found that through the passaging, modified vaccinia virus Ankara had lost about 10% of the ancestral vaccinia genome and with it the ability to replicate efficiently in most mammalian cells. While it can enter host cells, express its genes and replicate its genome, it fails to assemble virus particles that are released from the cell.
The vaccine was further developed and manufactured by the Danish company Bavarian Nordic, resulting in the vaccine MVA-BN, which is unable to replicate in human cells. The vaccine is given subcutaneously in two doses, at least 28 days apart. It was approved in Canada in 2013, as a smallpox vaccine and in 2020 also against mpox and related orthopoxvirus infections. It was approved in the European Union in 2013, as a vaccine against smallpox and in the US in September 2019, against smallpox and mpox. On 13 September 2024, the WHO has granted prequalification status to the MVA-BN vaccine, as the first vaccine approved for use against mpox.
In August 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorization for intradermal (rather than subcutaneous) mpox vaccination using a lower dose of Jynneos, which would increase the number of available doses up to five-fold. The vaccination would still be given in two doses, 28 days apart. A 2015 study had tested a regimen of one-fifth dose given intradermally.

Theoretical computer science,"Theoretical computer science is a subfield of computer science and mathematics that focuses on the abstract and mathematical foundations of computation.
It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. The ACM's Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT) provides the following description:

TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, algorithmic game theory, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra. Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.

History
While logical inference and mathematical proof had existed previously, in 1931 Kurt Gödel proved with his incompleteness theorem that there are fundamental limitations on what statements could be proved or disproved.
Information theory was added to the field with a 1948 mathematical theory of communication by Claude Shannon. In the same decade, Donald Hebb introduced a mathematical model of learning in the brain. With mounting biological data supporting this hypothesis with some modification, the fields of neural networks and parallel distributed processing were established. In 1971, Stephen Cook and, working independently, Leonid Levin, proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are NP-complete – a landmark result in computational complexity theory.
Modern theoretical computer science research is based on these basic developments, but includes many other mathematical and interdisciplinary problems that have been posed, as shown below:

Topics
Algorithms
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.
An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function.  Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing ""output"" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.

Automata theory
Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science, under discrete mathematics (a section of mathematics and also of computer science). Automata comes from the Greek word αὐτόματα meaning ""self-acting"".

Gouren,"Gouren is a style of folk wrestling which has been established in Brittany for several centuries. It is practiced mainly in Brittany, but also in some neighboring regions, in particular through international meetings organized by the FILC (Fédération Internationale des Luttes Celtiques), for example in Cornwall, in Scotland and a Gouren skol has opened in New Orleans, in the United States.
In today's France, Gouren is overseen by the Fédération de Gouren which has an agreement with the Fédération Française de Lutte (French Wrestling Federation).
Gouren is a standing wrestling art with a shirt on mat (""pallen""). As soon as one of the wrestlers touches the ground with a part of the body other than his feet, the fight is stopped, the protagonists get up, then resume the fight after shaking hands.

History
Origins
Wrestling (gouren in Breton) was used by most European armies before the use of firearms. Thus, when Briton immigrants settled massively in Armorica in the 4th century, it is probable that they brought with them martial techniques which, added to local ones, gradually led to the gouren that arose in the late Middle Ages. If it was undoubtedly originally mainly practiced by the nobles and the people of arms, the gouren was then borrowed, mainly after the Renaissance and the arrival of firearms, by the common people, as a popular fun practice. The archives tell us that many “minor nobles” excelled in this art, sometimes fighting with peasants or millers. Its organization was generally subject to seigniorial authorizations and it preserved from its noble origins the aiguillettes, gloves and doublets, trophies which were offered to victors until the French Revolution.
The term gouren is mentioned as early as 1464 in the Catholicon, the very first trilingual dictionary.
Writings by Ambroise Paré describe the Breton wrestling in 1543 as it was then practiced in western Brittany.

XIXth century
The 19th century saw municipal authorities organize numerous ""tournaments"", often at the time of the National Day, in order to show that a new authority was now in place, but also within the framework of official parish festivals under the control of the municipalities. However, the population of rural parishes also continued to organize ""local struggles"", in an almost ritualistic manner, at the time of chapel pardons. Gouren was then the only ""sport"" in the countryside and seen as an element of social and identity recognition for their parishes of origin.

“On the departmental road to Rosporden, raising a flood of dust, a fairly large number of peasants go to the party. (...) In the village, an even denser crowd blocks the road which forms the main street. (...) However, the dancing has already started in the middle of the street, disturbed at every moment by the stampede of arrivals. Two innkeepers have, in front of their stalls where the cider flows freely, each installed on a minstrels' platform. There are two on each platform, one playing the Binioù, t",sports
History of Smooth Island (Tasmania),"This article outlines the history of Smooth Island, popularly known as Garden Island, in Norfolk Bay, Tasmania. The names come from the island's gently undulating topography and lush vegetation in comparison with the stony mainland. It has been privately owned since 1864.

History
Before European settlement
Prior to European settlement, the Forestier Peninsula to the east of Smooth Island is believed to have been occupied by the Pydairrerme band of the Oyster Bay (Paredarerme) tribe of Aboriginal Tasmanians. They spoke the Paredarerme language. There is no recorded evidence of any remaining Paredarerme people in the region after the 1830s.

European settlement
In 1793 Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez (of the Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux expedition) was the first European to discover Smooth Island. The island is found on d'Entrecasteaux's maps, though it is unnamed.
On 15 December 1798 Matthew Flinders was the first Briton to set foot on Smooth Island. He stopped to take bearings and spent two nights on the island. He described his impression of the island:

[They] moved on to another island which, from a distance, appeared unusually attractive. At close quarters, the island seemed every bit as beautiful as it did from afar. Its surface was smooth and the texture of its soil contained a richness which is rarely found in uncultivated land. It was estimated that there must have been at least one hundred acres of good, yielding agricultural ground. But the unhappy and unforseen part of this seemingly natural course taken by the sloop was the denial of the sighting by the ship's personnel of an isthmus which would have been of great importance to them. But ""Smooth Island"", as they so aptly named it, was indeed delectable and aforded them two delightful days in exploring its scenery and absorbing its charm and beauty. They observed that the Aborigines paid this scenic spot many visits because of its garden-like qualities as compared with the stony-like terrain of the mainland which, although well-wooded and contained many kangaroos, seemed harsh and uninviting in comparison to their ""Garden Island"", a title it eventually acquired.
Flinders charted the island and his passage through the region on the map Chart of Terra Australis – By M Flinders – 1798–1799 – South Coast, Sheet VI. He described his initial impression of sailing eastwards from Doughboy Island in Frederick Henry Bay towards Norfolk Bay:

The country on the eastern side of the bay, is stony; and, wherever we landed, is wretchedly barren. The islands have a better appearance. Smooth Island, contains about one hundred acres of ground, that might answer for a garden: its soil is shallow and sandy.
  He appeared surprised by the nautical ability of the Aboriginal Tasmanians:
The natives of Frederick Henry Bay, have some mode of conveyance by water; for they had visited Betsey's Island, the Isle of Caves, Smooth Island, and Gull Island; and, perhaps, the others. It has been a received opinion,",history
Edwardian era,"In the United Kingdom, the Edwardian era was a period in the early 20th century that spanned the reign of King Edward VII from 1901 to 1910. It is commonly extended to the start of the First World War in 1914, during the early reign of King George V.
The era is dated from the death of Queen Victoria in January 1901, which marked the end of the Victorian era. Her son and successor, Edward VII, was already the leader of a fashionable elite that set a style influenced by the art and fashions of continental Europe. Samuel Hynes described the Edwardian era as a ""leisurely time when women wore picture hats and did not vote, when the rich were not ashamed to live conspicuously, and the sun never set on the British flag.""
The Liberals returned to power in 1906 and made significant reforms. Below the upper class, the era was marked by significant shifts in politics among sections of society that had largely been excluded from power, such as labourers, servants, and the industrial working class. Women started (again) to play more of a role in politics.

Perceptions
The Edwardian period is sometimes portrayed as a romantic golden age of long summer days and garden parties, basking in a sun that never set on the British Empire. This perception was created in the 1920s and later by those who remembered the Edwardian age with nostalgia, looking back to their childhoods across the abyss of the Great War. The Edwardian age was also seen as a mediocre period of pleasure between the great achievements of the preceding Victorian age and the catastrophe of the following war.
Recent assessments emphasise the great differences between the wealthy and the poor during this period and describe the age as heralding great changes in political and social life. Historian Lawrence James argued that the leaders felt increasingly threatened by rival powers such as Germany, Russia, and the United States. Nevertheless, the sudden arrival of World War I in the summer of 1914 was largely unexpected, except by the Royal Navy, because it had been prepared and readied for war.

Politics
There was a growing political awareness among the working class, leading to a rise in trade unions, the Labour movement and demands for better working conditions. The aristocracy remained in control of top government offices.

Conservative Party
The Conservatives – at the time called ""Unionists"" – were the dominant political party from the 1890s until 1906. The party had many strengths, appealing to voters supportive of imperialism, tariffs, the Church of England, a powerful Royal Navy, and traditional hierarchical society. There was a powerful leadership base in the landed aristocracy and landed gentry in rural England, plus strong support from the Church of England and military interests. Historians have used election returns to demonstrate that Conservatives did surprisingly well in working-class districts. They had an appeal as well to the better-off element of traditional working-class Britons in ",history
Amarna Period,"The Amarna Period was an era of Egyptian history during the later half of the Eighteenth Dynasty when the royal residence of the pharaoh and his queen shifted from the old capital of Thebes (Waset) to Akhetaten (literally 'Horizon of the Aten') in what is now modern Amarna.  This move occurred during the reign of Amenhotep IV, who changed his name to Akhenaten (1353–1336 BC) in order to reflect the dramatic change of Egypt's polytheistic religion into one where the sun disc Aten was worshipped over all other gods.  Toward the end of a Akhenaten's reign, he had a mysterious co-regent, Smenkhkare, about which very little is known; similarly, Neferneferuaten, a female ruler (perhaps the wife of Smenkhkare, or even Nefertiti herself?) also exercised influence.
Akhenaten, Smenkhkare, and Neferneferuaten were succeeded by Akhenaten's son Tutankhamun, only around nine-years old.  The Egyptian pantheon was swiftly restored under his reign.  Due to his youth, his viziers and advisors appear to have done most of the job of governance.  Much of the government moved to Memphis, Egypt during Tutankhamun's reign, reducing Akhetaten's importance.  Both of Tutankhamun's daughters predeceased him, and he died without an heir; he was succeeded as Pharoh by Ay.  Ay's short reign of three years was followed by Horemheb, who ordered the city of Akhetaten torn down.  Horemheb excised as much of the Amarna Period as he could from official histories and monuments, considering it an aberration.  According to Horemheb's revised monuments, he directly succeeded Amenhotep III, essentially erasing 30 years of history.

Religious developments
Akhenaten instigated the earliest verified expression of a form of monotheism, although the origins of a pure monotheism are the subject of continuing debate within the academic community. Some state that Akhenaten restored monotheism while others point out that he merely suppressed a dominant solar cult by the assertion of another, while never completely abandoning several other traditional deities. Scholars believe that Akhenaten's devotion to his deity, Aten, offended many in power below him, which contributed to the end of this dynasty; he later suffered damnatio memoriae. Although modern students of Egyptology consider the monotheism of Akhenaten the most important event of this period, the later Egyptians considered the so-called Amarna period an unfortunate aberration.

The period saw many innovations in the name and service of religion. Egyptians of the time viewed religion and science as one and the same. Previously, the presence of many gods explained the natural phenomena, but during the Amarna period there was a rise in monotheism. With people beginning to think of the origins of the universe, Amun-Re was seen as the sole creator and Sun-god. The view of this god is seen through the poem entitled ""Hymn to the Aten"": When your movements disappear and you go to rest in the Akhet, the land is in darkness, in the manner of death.",history
Cadre (politics),"In political contexts, cadre (, also UK: , also US: ) consists of persons with leadership skills within a political organization. In some socialist states, cadre is a group of people trained to carry out the goals of the party-state and disseminate and enforce the official ideology. These groups are meant to stimulate loyalty by mobilizing citizens and encouraging ideological and policy consensus. Cadres can be deployed in the field or employed in the office by the ruling party, the state, or the secret police. They are often created to break apart existing class hierarchies among citizens of the party-state. Cadres were in service in a number of varying countries, such as the Soviet Union and Ethiopia during the Derg. At present, the People's Republic of China maintains a cadre system.

Revolutionary socialist usage
For revolutionary socialists including Leninists, a cadre is a group of committed, active, and experienced intellectuals who share political beliefs and participate in the revolutionary movements they see the most promise in. The term can also refer to a member of said group.Cadres decide everything!

China
Romania
The Socialist Republic of Romania was an example of the use of cadres in communism, and an exploration of their role in Romania can give an overall picture of the importance of cadres.

Cadres were vital to spreading the ideology of Marxism–Leninism in Romania because cadres were the medium through which official party ideology was transmitted between countries. A cadre can and has been used by more countries than just Russia; their primary role makes them indispensable in ideology shift among a population. They functioned in two fashions throughout Romania (in particular), first to spread the communist ideology throughout the country and monitor communism's opinions among the rural populations to ensure that the Romanians viewed communism popularly. Collectivization relied on cadres to keep the system in order. However, due to the shortage of cadres, massive government surveillance and inconsistent policies produced an environment full of distrust and abuse. As a result, the cadre system consumed itself as frustration, distrust, and violence increased. These operational struggles were made worse by the fact that the cadres already had their work cut out for them due to the relative difficulty the party experienced in spreading their ideological base. The Romanian Communists attempted to execute a top-down conversion of their citizenry to communism, as opposed to a grassroots-style upheaval that was the case in Russia. This led to a situation where the workers and operatives they needed to most enthusiastically buy in were some of their strongest opposition most of the time. The state saw its operatives increasingly turn inwards and ensure their own well-being, frequently at the cost of other members of the party. There were even instances where the members would incriminate other cadres behaving the same way in the attemp",politics
Economics of scientific knowledge,"The economics of scientific knowledge is an approach to understanding science which is predicated on the need to understand scientific knowledge creation and dissemination in economic terms.
The approach has been developed as a contrast to the sociology of scientific knowledge, which places scientists in their social context and examines their behavior using social theory. The economics of scientific knowledge typically involves thinking of scientists as having economic interests with these being thought of as utility maximisation and science as being a market process. Modelling strategies might use any of a variety of approaches including the neoclassical, game theoretic, behavioural (bounded rationality) information theoretic and transaction costs. Boumans and Davis (2010) mention Dasgupta and David (1994) as being an interesting early example of work in this area.

Chairo (slang),"Chairo (feminine chaira) is a pejorative epithet that originated in Mexico to describe an individual who holds a far-left ideology, specifically any person who thoughtlessly defends, idolizes, and fawns over a populist politician and demagogue with an attitude similar to that of a religious fanatic.
The term ""chairo"" has indeed evolved over time and carries a specific cultural and political connotation in Mexico. Originally, it was used in the 1980s and 1990s to describe teenagers who were seen as naive or who espoused what others considered foolish or impractical ideas. The term is derived from ""chaqueta mental"" or ""chaira mental,"" which metaphorically suggests someone who is ""mentally masturbating""—essentially, indulging in unrealistic or impractical thoughts.
In contemporary usage, particularly in political discourse, ""chairo"" has taken on a more pointed meaning. It is often used pejoratively to describe individuals who are perceived as being overly idealistic, gullible, or supportive of populist or socialist policies. Critics use the term to suggest that these individuals believe in simplistic solutions to complex problems, such as the idea that wealth redistribution or government intervention alone can solve societal issues without personal effort or responsibility. The implication is that ""chairos"" are disconnected from reality, believing that being poor is somehow virtuous or that they are entitled to the wealth of others without contributing meaningfully to society.
This term is often used in a highly polarized political context, and its usage can be contentious. It reflects broader debates about economic policies, social justice, and the role of government in addressing inequality. As with many slang terms, its meaning can vary depending on the speaker and the context in which it is used.
Similar terms in other Spanish-speaking countries include perroflautas in Spain, zurdos in Argentina and comunachos in Chile.

Etymology
In the 1960s, a chairo or chaqueto was a term used to refer to an adolescent who was believed to masturbate in excess and as a result was self-absorbed or distracted.
The words have connection to chaqueta mental, literally mental jerk-off.
In her blog at El Universal, the blogger Tamara De Anda relates how she and her friends first tried to popularize chairo in high school to describe ""neo-hippie"" students that would take up camp in the best part of the school's garden. 
However, this account is not accurate. The term *chairo* did not originate in this way, nor was it tied to a specific group of ""neo-hippie"" students in high school. The story appears to be a fictionalized or exaggerated retelling, existing only in her mind. It was likely created to add a personal anecdote to the term's history or to claim credit for its popularization. Ironically, this could serve as a good example of what *chairo* means: someone who believes something to be true, but it only exists in their imagination. In this sense, she embodies the",politics

Richard C. Lillehei,"Richard C. Lillehei (10 December 1927 - 1 April 1981) was an American transplant surgeon who performed the world's first successful simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant in 1966 (sometimes quoted as 1967) and the first known human intestinal transplantation. He came from a renowned medical family in Minneapolis; his father was a dentist and his brothers were cardiologist James Lillehei and cardiothoracic surgeon C. Walton Lillehei. The Lillehei Surgical Society is named in honour of the three brothers.

Early life and education
Richard Carlton Lillehei was the son of a dentist from Minneapolis and the younger brother of cardiothoracic surgeon C. Walton Lillehei and cardiologist James Lillehei.
He completed his early education from West Side High School in Edina, Minnesota and in 1948 graduated from the University of Minnesota. After graduating in medicine in 1951 from the University's medical school, he spent two years at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and gained his PhD in Surgery from the University of Minnesota in 1960.

Pancreas transplantation
On 17 December 1966, Lillehei assisted William Kelly in transplanting part of a pancreas and a whole kidney into a 28-year-old woman with type I diabetes and renal disease. Postoperative problems led to a decision to remove the graft, and she died soon after. On New Year's Eve 1966, Lillehei led the world's first successful simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant. It involved transplanting the whole pancreas, accompanying duodenum and one kidney. The recipient survived four and a half months.
By 1973, he had performed 13 pancreas transplants.
His other fields of research included shock treatment, organ procurement, open-heart surgery and kidney transplantation.

Personal and family
Lillehei married B.J. (Elizabeth Jeanne) and they had four sons, Richard C., Ted, John and James.

Death and legacy
In 1986, the Lillehei Surgical Society was founded in the names of the three Lillehei brothers.
Every two years an award is given to the most outstanding clinician in the field of pancreas transplantation.

The Top 100 Drugs,"The Top 100 Drugs: Clinical Pharmacology and Practical Prescribing is a pocket-size medical manual focusing on the most commonly prescribed medicines by the British National Health Service (NHS). It was first published by Churchill Livingstone, Elsevier, in 2014, revised in a second edition in 2018, and again in 2022 in a third edition. It is authored by four clinical pharmacologists from St George's Hospital, London; Andrew Hitchings, Dagan Lonsdale, Daniel Burrage and Emma Baker.
The drugs are described in alphabetical order, with each drug or drug class on a double page. Each is subsequently explained in terms of clinical pharmacology and practical prescribing. Intravenous fluids are dealt with later in the book, followed by a self-assessment.
The book received a review in Pulse, and in 2018 was listed as an essential reference book for junior doctors by the Pharmaceutical Journal.

Development and publication
The Top 100 Drugs is a medical manual which aims to reduce risks in prescribing. It includes a list of commonly prescribed medicines by the British NHS, for undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in the UK. It was first published as an e-book by Churchill Livingstone, Elsevier, in 2014. A second edition was published in 2018.
The first edition was based on the 100 most frequently prescribed drugs by the NHS in 2006–2009, first described in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology in 2011 by Emma Baker, who identified the drugs with how they appear in the British National Formulary (BNF). The book is authored by Baker and three other clinical pharmacologists from St George's Hospital; Andrew Hitchings, Dagan Lonsdale and Daniel Burrage, and takes into account suggestions from junior doctors. The list was revised in 2015, using data collected from a larger dataset to check that no significant changes had occurred, and formed the basis of the second edition, in which 11 drugs were replaced and the number of self-assessment questions doubled. A third edition was released in 2022.

John Brian Walker,"John Brian Walker (1924 – 15 October 2014) was a British general practitioner with a prior career in eye surgery. After studying at New College, Oxford and while studying medicine at The London Hospital in 1945, he was one of the London medical students who were sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp shortly after its liberation by British troops, to assist in the feeding of the severely malnourished and dying inmates, under the supervision of nutritionist Arnold Peter Meiklejohn. After gaining his medical degree, he was drafted into the army and sent to east Africa, where he became an eye surgeon. Following demobilisation, he returned to London with his wife Mary and took on his father's general practice. Walker was also known for his skill in sailing with the Hornet dinghy fleet throughout the 1950s to 1970s.

Early life
John Brian Walker was born in Catford, London. After studying at New College, Oxford and while studying medicine at The London Hospital in 1945, he was one of the London medical students who were sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp shortly after its liberation by British troops, to assist in the feeding of the severely malnourished and dying inmates, under the supervision of nutritionist Arnold Peter Meiklejohn.
After gaining his medical degree, he was drafted into the army and sent to east Africa, where he became an eye surgeon and married Mary, a Royal London Hospital nurse. Following the demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War, he returned to London with Mary and ran his father's general practice. They had one son and a daughter.

Later life
Walker was also known for his skill in sailing with the Hornet dinghy fleet throughout the 1950s to 1970s. With Mary, they ran a ""cadet week"" at Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, to help young people learn to sail. They later had an Alan Buchanan 44 foot yacht built. It was launched in 1991 and they spent many summers sailing it around the Mediterranean.

Death
On 15 October 2014, he died from congestive cardiac failure at home in Cornwall. Mary had died before him and his son died in 2011. On 1 November 2014, a memorial was held at the Harbour Club in Portscatho, Cornwall. He donated his body to a medical school for the study of anatomy. He was outlived by one daughter, Stefanie.

Information theory,"Information theory is the mathematical study of the quantification, storage, and communication of information. The field was established and formalized by Claude Shannon in the 1940s, though early contributions were made in the 1920s through the works of Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley. It is at the intersection of electronic engineering, mathematics, statistics, computer science, neurobiology, physics, and electrical engineering.
A key measure in information theory is entropy. Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip (which has two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy, less uncertainty) than identifying the outcome from a roll of a die (which has six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are mutual information, channel capacity, error exponents, and relative entropy. Important sub-fields of information theory include source coding, algorithmic complexity theory, algorithmic information theory and information-theoretic security.
Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding/data compression (e.g. for ZIP files), and channel coding/error detection and correction (e.g. for DSL). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the Voyager missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the Internet and artificial intelligence. The theory has also found applications in other areas, including statistical inference, cryptography, neurobiology, perception, signal processing, linguistics, the evolution and function of molecular codes (bioinformatics), thermal physics, molecular dynamics, black holes, quantum computing, information retrieval, intelligence gathering, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, anomaly detection, the analysis of music, art creation, imaging system design, study of outer space, the dimensionality of space, and epistemology.

Overview
Information theory studies the transmission, processing, extraction, and utilization of information. Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty. In the case of communication of information over a noisy channel, this abstract concept was formalized in 1948 by Claude Shannon in a paper entitled A Mathematical Theory of Communication, in which information is thought of as a set of possible messages, and the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the channel noise. Shannon's main result, the noisy-channel coding theorem, showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the channel capacity, a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent.

Chalcolithic,"The Chalcolithic ( KAL-kə-LI-thik) (also called the Copper Age and Eneolithic) was an archaeological period characterized by the increasing use of smelted copper. It followed the Neolithic and preceded the Bronze Age. It occurred at different periods in different areas, but was absent in some  parts of the world, such as Russia, where there was no well-defined Copper Age between the Stone and Bronze Ages. Stone tools were still predominantly used during this period.
The Chalcolithic covers both the early cold working (hammering) of near pure copper ores, as exhibited by the likes of North American Great Lakes Old Copper complex, from around 6,500 BC, through the later copper smelting cultures. The archaeological site of Belovode, on Rudnik mountain in Serbia, has the world's oldest securely dated evidence of copper smelting at high temperature, from c. 5,000 BC. The transition from Copper Age to Bronze Age in Europe occurred between the late 5th and the late 3rd millennium BC. In the Ancient Near East the Copper Age covered about the same period, beginning in the late 5th millennium BC and lasting for about a millennium before it gave rise to the Early Bronze Age.
A study in the journal Antiquity from 2013 reporting the discovery of a tin bronze foil from the Pločnik archaeological site dated to c. 4,650 BC, as well as 14 other artefacts from Bulgaria and Serbia dated to before 4,000 BC, showed that early tin bronze was more common than previously thought and developed independently in Europe 1,500 years before the first tin bronze alloys in the Near East. In Britain, the Chalcolithic is a short period between about 2,500 and 2,200 BC, characterized by the first appearance of objects of copper and gold, a new ceramic culture and the immigration of Beaker culture people, heralding the end of the local late Neolithic.

Terminology
The multiple names result from multiple definitions of the period. Originally, the term Bronze Age meant that either copper or bronze was being used as the chief hard substance for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Ancient writers, who provided the essential cultural references for educated people during the 19th century, used the same name for both copper- and bronze-using ages.
The concept of the Copper Age was put forward by Hungarian scientist Ferenc Pulszky in the 1870s, when, on the basis of the significant number of large copper objects unearthed within the Carpathian Basin, he suggested that the previous threefold division of the Prehistoric Age – the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages – should be further divided with the introduction of the Copper Age.
In 1881, John Evans recognized that use of copper often preceded the use of bronze, and distinguished between a transitional Copper Age and the Bronze Age proper. He did not include the transitional period in the Bronze Age, but described it separately from the customary stone / bronze / iron system, at the Bronze Age's beginning. He did not, however, present it as a ",history
Calisthenics (Australia),"In Australia, calisthenics (also known as Australian calisthenics) is a team-based competitive performing art taking elements of rhythmic gymnastics and ballet combined with a strong emphasis on theatricality (both musical and dramatic), costume, dance and musical interpretation. Since the 1950s Calisthenics has been an entirely female art form, however males have recently been re-introduced in the younger age groups. The art form was created entirely in Australia and can be easily differentiated from traditional calisthenics by its focus on competition and choreographed theatrical performance instead of simple synchronized exercise. The word itself comes from the Greek words for beauty and strength. Calisthenics is currently practiced in all states except Tasmania and has recently been introduced in New Zealand.

Format
Calisthenics consists of performing a variety of 'items' which are usually presented at eisteddfod-like stage competitions. Currently the items performed in Calisthenics are: Figure March, Club Swinging, Free Exercises, Rod Exercises, Aesthetics, and a couple other 'Fancy Items'. Fancy items are those items which typically focus on the theatrical performance other aspects, and are included on a rotational basis (i.e. not all performed every year). Fancy items include Song and Dance, Rhythmic (similar to Aesthetics), Stage Medley, Dance Arrangement, Folk Dance and Calisthenics Revue, usually the same moves in different sequence per song. At the most elite level, Calisthenics competitors are required to have some knowledge of flexibility, strength, balance and control, precision, technique, execution and an idea of Choreography is also required.
Competitors wear costumes often designed and sewn by the parents for the year's competition items. The competitors also wear heavy theatrical make up to emphasize expressions on stage. Team competition is the main form of competition, however solo competitions including ""Graceful Solo"" (a solo similar to that of Aesthetics) and ""Solo and Duo"" (a solo that is similar to that of Free Exercises, but must be an equal blend of that and dance) are also a part of the performance art. For example, one of the highlights of the year for the elite solo competitor is a competition category called ""Most Graceful Girl"".

Age groups
Competitors are currently grouped into six sections based on their age as at 31 December in the year that the competition is held. The Australian Calisthenic Federation (ACF) rules state in relation to age ""Flexible rule for each state"" but quotes the following groupings in the rule book:

Tinies (7 and under)
Sub-juniors (10 and under)
Juniors (13 and under)
Intermediates (16 and under)
Seniors (17 years and over - no maximum)
Masters (26 years and over)

Cryptography,"Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós ""hidden, secret""; and γράφειν graphein, ""to write"", or -λογία -logia, ""study"", respectively), is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, physics, and others. Core concepts related to information security (data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation) are also central to cryptography. Practical applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.
Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting readable information (plaintext) to unintelligible nonsense text (ciphertext), which can only be read by reversing the process (decryption). The sender of an encrypted (coded) message shares the decryption (decoding) technique only with the intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the names ""Alice"" (or ""A"") for the sender, ""Bob"" (or ""B"") for the intended recipient, and ""Eve"" (or ""E"") for the eavesdropping adversary. Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II, cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and their applications more varied.
Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed ""computationally secure"". Theoretical advances (e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms) and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated and, if necessary, adapted. Information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, such as the one-time pad, are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.
The growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the Information Age. Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export. In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for docume",science
Middle Babylonian period,"The Middle Babylonian period, also known as the Kassite period, in southern Mesopotamia is dated from c. 1595 – c. 1155 BC and began after the Hittites sacked the city of Babylon. The Kassites, whose dynasty is synonymous with the period, eventually assumed political control over the region and consolidated their power by subjugating the Sealand dynasty c. 1475 BC. After the subjugation of the Sealand dynasty, the Kassites unified the region of Babylonia into a single political entity. At the height of the Middle Babylonian period, the Kassite kings were engaging in commerce, trade, and organising diplomatic marriages with the kings of Egypt and other regional powers. However, after a period of gradual decline, the Middle Babylonian period collapsed with the fall of the Kassite dynasty c. 1155 BC. The collapse came as a result of an Assyrian invasion (c. 1232 – c. 1225 BC), that temporarily displaced the Kassites from their rule over southern Mesopotamia. Finally, the Elamites conducted various raids and eventually invaded Babylonian c. 1158 BC, which brought the Kassite dynasty and Middle Babylonian period to an end.
There are however differing chronologies of the period proposed by some contemporary scholars, with some suggesting that the Middle Babylonian period only proceeded the collapse of the Kassite period of c. 1150 BC. While other scholars take the whole period of c. 1595 – c. 626 BC as constituting the Middle Babylonian period.

Sack of Babylon (c. 1595 BC)
Prior to 1595 BC, during the Old Babylonian period, the region of southern Mesopotamia was in a period of gradual decline and political uncertainty after the successors of Hammurabi were unable to maintain their kingdom. The successors had lost control of the lucrative trade routes between the northern and southern regions of Babylonia to the First Sealand dynasty which had detrimental economic ramifications. In c. 1595 BC, the Hittite king Mursili I invaded the region of southern Mesopotamia after having defeated the powerful neighbouring kingdom of Aleppo. The Hittites proceeded to sack the city of Babylon which ended the Hammurabi dynasty and Old Babylonian period. However, the Hittites chose not to subjugate Babylon or the surrounding regions and instead withdrew from the conquered city up the Euphrates River to their homeland ""Hatti-land"". The Hittite's decision to invade southern Mesopotamia and sack the city of Babylon is subject to debate among contemporary historians. It is suggested that the successors of Hammurabi were either allied with Aleppo, or the sudden Hittite expansion indicates that their motives were ""land, manpower, control of [trade] routes and access to valuable ore-deposits"".

Dark age and Kassite unification (c. 1595 – c. 1475 BC)
Following the Hittites withdrawal from Babylon, the region was plunged into further political turmoil. During this period, the Kassites, who were a relatively unknown group of people in Babylonia, emerged as the preeminent authori",history
Blacklisting,"Blacklisting is the action of a group or authority compiling a blacklist of people, countries or other entities to be avoided or distrusted as being deemed unacceptable to those making the list; if people are on a blacklist, then they are considered to have done something wrong, or they are considered to be untrustworthy. As a verb, blacklist can mean to put an individual or entity on such a list. A blacklist is synonymous with a list of banned persons or organizations, and is the opposite of a whitelist.

Origins of the term
The English dramatist Philip Massinger used the phrase ""black list"" in his 1639 tragedy The Unnatural Combat.
After the restoration of the English monarchy brought Charles II of England to the throne in 1660, a list of regicides named those to be punished for the execution of his father. The state papers of Charles II say ""If any innocent soul be found in this black list, let him not be offended at me, but consider whether some mistaken principle or interest may not have misled him to vote"". In a 1676 history of the events leading up to the Restoration, James Heath (a supporter of Charles II) alleged that Parliament had passed an Act requiring the sale of estates, ""And into this black list the Earl of Derby was now put, and other unfortunate Royalists"".
Edward Gibbon wrote in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776) of Andronicus that ""His memory was stored with a black list of the enemies and rivals, who had traduced his merit, opposed his greatness, or insulted his misfortunes"".

History
Employment
The first published reference to blacklisting of an employee dates from 1774. This became a significant employment issue in American mining towns and company towns, where blacklisting could mean a complete loss of livelihood for workers who went on strike. The 1901 Report of the Industrial Commission stated ""There was no doubt in the minds of workingmen of the existence of the blacklisting system, though it was practically impossible to obtain evidence of it."" It cited a news report that in 1895 a former conductor on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad committed suicide, having been out of work ever since a strike: ""Wherever he went, the blacklist was ahead of him"".
Though the USA National Labor Relations Act of 1935 outlawed punitive blacklists against employees who supported trade unions or criticised their employers, the practice continued in common use in the USA. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 made amendments which sustained blacklisting by affirming the right of employers to be anti-union, and by requiring trade union leaders to make loyalty oaths which had the same effect as the Hollywood blacklist. Since then, lawsuits for unfair dismissal have led to blacklisting being covert or informal, but it remains common.

Fair trade cocoa,"Fair trade cocoa is an agricultural product harvested from a cocoa tree using a certified process which is followed by cocoa farmers, buyers, and chocolate manufacturers, and is designed to create sustainable incomes for farmers and their families.  Companies that use fair trade certified cocoa to create products can advertise that they are contributing to social, economic, and environmental sustainability in agriculture.

Background
In the 1990s, exactly 1 percent of the world's cocoa was produced on small, family managed farms, primarily in West Africa and Latin America. Local collectors and intermediaries purchase and transport the cocoa to exporters and processors. Many farmers are unaware of the final destination and value of their cocoa.  Low prices and increasing need for fertilizer often created  labor shortage, leading to slave labor in many West African countries with cocoa production.
Fair trade cocoa certification was created to overcome these problems. The first fair trade certification of a cocoa product was arranged by the Max Havelaar Foundation of the Netherlands in 1994.   The product was Green & Black's Maya Gold Chocolate, which was made with cocoa from Belize.  The Max Havelaar Foundation was also the first Fairtrade Certification Mark.  The Dutch foundation has now incorporated itself into Fairtrade International (FLO), a nonprofit organization with 25 member countries that use fair trade certification labels.
In 2002, Fair Trade USA, which at that time had been incorporated into Fair Trade International (FLO), started certifying fair trade cocoa products sold in the United States.   In September 2011, Fair Trade USA split from Fair Trade International (FLO).
In 2001, the issue of forced labour in cocoa production was brought to the public's attention by a series of articles published in the United States by Sudarsan Raghavan, Sumana Chaterjee, and the Knight Ridder news agency.  They included interviews with victims of child trafficking for cocoa production.   Noting that the United States has laws against importing goods produced using slave labor, Congressman Eliot Engel and Senator Tom Harkin proposed to enact a ""slave-free"" label for chocolate.  The United States cocoa industry lobbied against this, and the mandatory labeling proposal was reduced to a voluntary system. Under this system, known as the Harkin–Engel Protocol, chocolate producers pledged that by 1 July 2005, they would use ""standards ... consistent with applicable federal law, that ensure cocoa beans and their derivative products have been produced without the worst forms of child labor.""
A major study of the issue in 2016, published in Fortune magazine in the U.S., concluded that approximately 2.1 million children in West Africa ""still do the dangerous and physically taxing work of harvesting cocoa"". The report was doubtful as to whether the situation can be improved.

History of science and technology,"The history of science and technology (HST) is a field of history that examines the development of the understanding of the natural world (science) and humans' ability to manipulate it (technology) at different points in time. This academic discipline also examines the cultural, economic, and political context and impacts of scientific practices; it likewise may study the consequences of new technologies on existing scientific fields.

Academic study of history of science
History of science is an academic discipline with an international community of specialists. Main professional organizations for this field include the History of Science Society, the British Society for the History of Science, and the European Society for the History of Science.
Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science is, how it functions, and whether it exhibits large-scale patterns and trends.

History of the academic study of history of science
Histories of science were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with William Whewell's History of the Inductive Sciences (1837), as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public.
Auguste Comte proposed that there should be a specific discipline to deal with the history of science.
The development of the distinct academic discipline of the history of science and technology did not occur until the early 20th century. Historians have suggested that this was bound to the changing role of science during the same time period.
After World War I, extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world.
In the decades since the end of World War II, history of science became an academic discipline, with graduate schools, research institutes, public and private patronage, peer-reviewed journals, and professional societies.

Formation of academic departments
In the United States, a more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was initiated by George Sarton's publications, Introduction to the History of Science (1927) and the journal Isis (founded in 1912). Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress.
The study of the history of science continued to be a small effort until the rise of Big Science after World War II. With the work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard University, the history of science began to become an established subdiscipline of history in the United States.
In the United States, the influential bureaucrat Vannevar Bush, and the president of Harvard, James Conant, both encouraged the study of the history of science as a ",technology

Picnic horse racing,"Picnic horse racing, or more usually picnic races or more  colloquially ""the picnics"" refer to amateur Thoroughbred horse racing meetings, predominantly in Australia. The meetings are organised by amateur clubs, the jockeys are amateur riders, or sometimes former professional jockeys. The horses competing are generally of a standard insufficient to be competitive at professional meetings. They are often trained by hobby trainers. 
The meetings are more of a social occasion and are often held on Public Holidays, or on days when major metropolitan races such as the Melbourne Cup are held.

Exact sciences,"The exact sciences or quantitative sciences, sometimes called the exact mathematical sciences, are those sciences ""which admit of absolute precision in their results""; especially the mathematical sciences.   Examples of the exact sciences are mathematics, optics, astronomy, and physics, which many philosophers from Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant to the logical positivists took as paradigms of rational and objective knowledge.  These sciences have been practiced in many cultures from antiquity to modern times.   Given their ties to mathematics, the exact sciences are characterized by accurate quantitative expression, precise predictions and/or rigorous methods of testing hypotheses involving quantifiable predictions and measurements.
The distinction between the quantitative exact sciences and those sciences that deal with the causes of things is due to Aristotle, who distinguished mathematics from natural philosophy and considered the exact sciences to be the ""more natural of the branches of mathematics.""  Thomas Aquinas employed this distinction when he said that astronomy explains the spherical shape of the Earth by mathematical reasoning while physics explains it by material causes.  This distinction was widely, but not universally, accepted until the scientific revolution of the 17th century.  Edward Grant has proposed that a fundamental change leading to the new sciences was the unification of the exact sciences and physics by Kepler, Newton, and others, which resulted in a quantitative investigation of the physical causes of natural phenomena.
Linguistics and comparative philology have also been considered exact sciences, most notably by Benjamin Whorf.

Technosignature,"Technosignature or technomarker is any measurable property or effect that provides scientific evidence of past or present technology. Technosignatures are analogous to biosignatures, which signal the presence of life, whether intelligent or not. Some authors prefer to exclude radio transmissions from the definition, but such restrictive usage is not widespread. Jill Tarter has proposed that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) be renamed ""the search for technosignatures"". Various types of technosignatures, such as radiation leakage from megascale astroengineering installations such as Dyson spheres, the light from an extraterrestrial ecumenopolis, or Shkadov thrusters with the power to alter the orbits of stars around the Galactic Center, may be detectable with hypertelescopes.  Some examples of technosignatures are described in Paul Davies's 2010 book The Eerie Silence, although the terms ""technosignature"" and ""technomarker"" do not appear in the book.
In February 2023, astronomers reported, after scanning 820 stars, the detection of 8 possible technosignatures for follow-up studies.

Astroengineering projects
A Dyson sphere, constructed by life forms dwelling in proximity to a Sun-like star, would cause an increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the star system's emitted spectrum. Hence, Freeman Dyson selected the title ""Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation"" for his 1960 paper on the subject. SETI has adopted these assumptions in its search, looking for such ""infrared heavy"" spectra from solar analogs. Since 2005, Fermilab has conducted an ongoing survey for such spectra, analyzing data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite.
Identifying one of the many infra-red sources as a Dyson sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson sphere and natural sources. Fermilab discovered 17 ""ambiguous"" candidates, of which four have been named ""amusing but still questionable"". Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which remain unconfirmed. In October 2012, astronomer Geoff Marcy, one of the pioneers of the search for extrasolar planets, was given a research grant to search data from the Kepler telescope, with the aim of detecting possible signs of Dyson spheres.

Orbital paths, transit signatures, stellar activity and star-system composition
Shkadov thrusters, with the hypothetical ability to change the orbital paths of stars in order to avoid various dangers to life such as cold molecular clouds or cometary impacts, would also be detectable in a similar fashion to the transiting extrasolar planets searched by Kepler. Unlike planets, though, the thrusters would appear to abruptly stop over the surface of a star rather than crossing it completely, revealing their technological origin. In addition, evidence of targeted extrasolar asteroid mining may also reveal extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). Furthermore, it has been suggested that information could be hidden within",technology
Geographical exploration,"Geographical exploration, sometimes considered the default meaning for the more general term exploration, refers to the practice of discovering remote lands and regions of the planet Earth. It is studied by geographers and historians.
Two major eras of exploration occurred in human history: one of convergence, and one of divergence. The first, covering most of Homo sapiens history, saw humans moving out of Africa, settling in new lands, and developing distinct cultures in relative isolation. Early explorers settled in Europe and Asia; 14,000 years ago, some crossed the Ice Age land bridge from Siberia to Alaska, and moved southbound to settle in the Americas. For the most part, these cultures were ignorant of each other's existence. The second period of exploration, occurring over the last 10,000 years, saw increased cross-cultural exchange through trade and exploration, and marked a new era of cultural intermingling, and more recently, convergence.
Early writings about exploration date back to the 4th millennium B.C. in ancient Egypt. One of the earliest and most impactful thinkers of exploration was Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Between the 5th century and 15th century AD, most exploration was done by Chinese and Arab explorers. This was followed by the Age of Discovery after European scholars rediscovered the works of early Latin and Greek geographers. While the Age of Discovery was partly driven by European land routes becoming unsafe, and a desire for conquest, the 17th century saw exploration driven by nobler motives, including scientific discovery and the expansion of knowledge about the world. This broader knowledge of the world's geography meant that people were able to make world maps, depicting all land known. The first modern atlas was the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, published by Abraham Ortelius, which included a world map that depicted all of Earth's continents.: 32

Concept
Exploration is the process of exploring, which has been defined as:

To examine or investigate something systematically.
To travel somewhere in search of discovery.
To examine diagnostically.
To (seek) experience first hand.
To wander without any particular aim or purpose.

Notable historical periods of human exploration

The Phoenicians (1550 BCE–300 BCE) traded throughout the Mediterranean Sea and Asia Minor though many of their routes are still unknown today. The presence of tin in some Phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to Britain. According to Virgil's Aeneid and other ancient sources, the legendary Queen Dido was a Phoenician from Tyre who sailed to North Africa and founded the city of Carthage.

Appearance of impropriety,"The appearance of impropriety is a phrase referring to a situation which to a layperson without knowledge of the specific circumstances might seem to raise ethics questions.  For instance, although a person might regularly and reliably collect money for her employer in her personal wallet and later give it to her employer, her putting it in her personal wallet may appear improper and give rise to suspicion of commingling. It is common practice in the business and legal communities to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

1 Thessalonians 5:22, in the King James Version of the Bible, says ""Abstain from all appearance of evil.""

Australian rules football,"Australian rules football, also called Australian football or Aussie rules, or more simply football or footy, is a contact sport played between two teams of 18 players on an oval field, often a modified cricket ground. Points are scored by kicking the oval ball between the central goal posts (worth six points), or between a central and outer post (worth one point, otherwise known as a ""behind"").
During general play, players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are kicking, handballing and running with the ball. There are rules on how the ball can be handled; for example, players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground. Throwing the ball is not allowed, and players must not get caught holding the ball. A distinctive feature of the game is the mark, where players anywhere on the field who catch the ball from a kick (with specific conditions) are awarded unimpeded possession. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid. Players can tackle using their hands or use their whole body to obstruct opponents. Dangerous physical contact (such as pushing an opponent in the back), interference when marking, and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks, distance penalties, or suspension for a certain number of matches depending on the severity of the infringement. The game features frequent physical contests, spectacular marking, fast movement of both players and the ball, and high scoring.
The sport's origins can be traced to football matches played in Melbourne, Victoria, in 1858, inspired by English public school football games. Seeking to develop a game more suited to adults and Australian conditions, the Melbourne Football Club published the first laws of Australian football in May 1859.
Australian football has the highest spectator attendance and television viewership of all sports in Australia, while the Australian Football League (AFL), the sport's only fully professional competition, is the nation's wealthiest sporting body. The AFL Grand Final, held annually at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, is the second-highest-attended club championship event in the world. The sport is also played at amateur level in many countries and in several variations. Its rules are governed by the AFL Commission with the advice of the AFL's Laws of the Game Committee.

Name
Australian rules football is known by several nicknames, including Aussie rules, football and footy. In some regions, where other codes of football are more popular, the sport is most often called AFL after the Australian Football League, while the league itself also uses this name for local competitions in some areas.

Era of Fragmentation,"The Era of Fragmentation (Tibetan: སིལ་ཆད་དུ་འཆད་པ; Chinese: 吐蕃分裂時期) was an era of disunity in Tibetan history lasting from the death of the Tibetan Empire's last emperor, Langdarma, in 842 until Drogön Chögyal Phagpa became the Imperial Preceptor of the three regions of Tibet in 1253, following the Mongol conquest in the 1240s. During this period, the political unity of the Tibetan Empire collapsed following a civil war between Yumtän (Yum brtan) and Ösung (’Od-srung), after which followed numerous rebellions against the remnants of imperial Tibet and the rise of regional warlords.

Civil war and the decline of imperial Tibet
The last king of the unified Tibetan Empire, Langdarma, was assassinated in 842 possibly by a Buddhist hermit monk named Pelgyi Dorje of Lhalung, or other sources state he died from fright. The death left two possible heirs, the two princes Yumtän and Ösung, that fought for the throne and initiated a civil war. This civil war weakened the political authority of the Tibetan monarchy, dissolving Tibet into separate tribes and small kingdoms.
The successors of Ösung controlled the western region of Ngari, while the successors of Yumtän controlled the central region  of Ü. The son of Ösung was Pälkhortsän (Dpal 'khor brtsan) (865–895 or 893–923), who had two sons, Trashi Tsentsän (Bkra shis brtsen brtsan) and Thrikhyiding (Khri khyi lding), also called Kyide Nyigön (Skyid lde nyi ma mgon) in some sources. Thrikhyiding migrated to the western Tibetan region of upper Ngari (Stod Mnga ris) and married a woman of high central Tibetan nobility, with whom he founded a local dynasty that would go on to create the kingdoms of Purang-Guge, Maryul, and Zanskar.

Revolts and autonomy
The dissolution of a centralized empire returned imperial Tibet to a multitude of separate, autonomous kingdoms, each ruled by a local leader, as were the local polities before Songsten Gampo.  The leaders constantly fought for political dominance, utilizing their private armies and military fortresses. Between 842 and 1247, no central authority was in control of Tibet and relatively smaller kingdoms like Guge, Derge, Nangchen, and Maryul (Ladakh) emerged. The period ended with the Mongol conquest of Tibet and the subsequent Yuan rule of Tibet and patronage of the Sakya school.
Traditional accounts of the period focus on religion. The Era of Fragmentation is depicted as a low point in the development of Tibetan Buddhism, with the Nyingma school's monastic orders facing persecution and internal exile. Nyingma monasteries were alleged to have only persevered in Amdo, then largely dominated by non-Tibetan peoples and conquered by a Tibetan polity in the 10th century.
In Amdo and during the brief reign of Langdarma, three Nyingma school monks fled to there, possibly to Mount Dantig. Their disciple Muzu Selbar (Wylie: mu zu gsal 'bar), later known as the scholar Gongpa Rapsel (Wylie: dgongs pa rab gsal, 953-1035), was responsible for the revival of the Nyingma sch",history
Germ theory's key 19th century figures,"In the mid to late nineteenth century, scientific patterns emerged which contradicted the widely held miasma theory of disease. These findings led medical science to what we now know as the germ theory of disease. The germ theory of disease proposes that invisible microorganisms (bacteria and viruses) are the cause of particular illnesses in both humans and animals. Prior to medicine becoming hard science, there were many philosophical theories about how disease originated and was transmitted. Though there were a few early thinkers that described the possibility of microorganisms, it was not until the mid to late nineteenth century when several noteworthy figures made discoveries which would provide more efficient practices and tools to prevent and treat illness. The mid-19th century figures set the foundation for change, while the late-19th century figures solidified the theory.

Mid-19th century figures and their discoveries
Florence Nightingale
Florence Nightingale, like the majority of people living in the Victorian time period, believed in the miasma theory of disease. Though she was a mathematician and statistician, she was asked by the British secretary of war to join a nursing service during The Crimean War. When Nightingale arrived in Scutari, Turkey, the conditions of the British army hospital were gruesome and putrid. She noticed the leading cause of mortality for soldiers was not battle, but rather infection and illness. Though she still believed at that time ""foul air"" caused disease (miasma theory), she began a cleaning protocol to improve the air quality. There were men and areas of the hospital covered in feces. The plumbing and sewer system were both broken and their water supply at the hospital was mixed with sewer water. There was an infestation of both vermin and insects. Nightingale reported these concerns to the British Sanitary Commission so they could help with these large items on her agenda to fix. Nightingale also implemented a laundry service for both bedsheets and clothing, she proposed handwashing procedures for nurses, patient bathing practices were introduced, clean bandages were obtained, and healthy meals were provided.
When Florence Nightingale first came to the hospital, the doctors and staff were not interested in hearing her ideas. They were also disinterested in the use of female nurses. However, when the hospital became understaffed and overpopulated, Nightingale and the 38 other women who came to serve, were then allowed to make these changes. Prior to Nightingale and her team, the mortality rate at the hospital was roughly 40%. However, with these new practices in place the number fell to 2%  This became public and was printed in the British news. Nightingale, who wandered the hospital at night checking on patients, became known as ""The lady with the lamp"" and acquired new found prominence within her country.
Nightingale wrote about her experience at the hospital when she returned to England. Notes on Mat",medicine
Alternative medicine,"Alternative medicine is any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of medicine despite lacking biological plausibility, testability, repeatability or evidence of effectiveness. Unlike modern medicine, which employs the scientific method to test plausible therapies by way of responsible and ethical clinical trials, producing repeatable evidence of either effect or of no effect, alternative therapies reside outside of mainstream medicine and do not originate from using the scientific method, but instead rely on testimonials, anecdotes, religion, tradition, superstition, belief in supernatural ""energies"", pseudoscience, errors in reasoning, propaganda, fraud, or other unscientific sources. Frequently used terms for relevant practices are New Age medicine, pseudo-medicine, unorthodox medicine, holistic medicine, fringe medicine, and unconventional medicine, with little distinction from quackery.
Some alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the established science of how the human body works; others appeal to the supernatural or superstitious to explain their effect or lack thereof. In others, the practice has plausibility but lacks a positive risk–benefit outcome probability. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols (such as placebo-controlled trials, blind experiments and calculation of prior probability), providing invalid results. History has shown that if a method is proven to work, it eventually ceases to be alternative and becomes mainstream medicine.
Much of the perceived effect of an alternative practice arises from a belief that it will be effective, the placebo effect, or from the treated condition resolving on its own (the natural course of disease). This is further exacerbated by the tendency to turn to alternative therapies upon the failure of medicine, at which point the condition will be at its worst and most likely to spontaneously improve. In the absence of this bias, especially for diseases that are not expected to get better by themselves such as cancer or HIV infection, multiple studies have shown significantly worse outcomes if patients turn to alternative therapies. While this may be because these patients avoid effective treatment, some alternative therapies are actively harmful (e.g. cyanide poisoning from amygdalin, or the intentional ingestion of hydrogen peroxide) or actively interfere with effective treatments.
The alternative medicine sector is a highly profitable industry with a strong lobby, and faces far less regulation over the use and marketing of unproven treatments. Complementary medicine (CM), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), integrated medicine or integrative medicine (IM), and holistic medicine attempt to combine alternative practices with those of mainstream medicine. Traditional medicine practices become ""alternative"" when used outside their original settings and without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Alternativ",medicine

History of Taiwan (1945–present),"As a result of the surrender and occupation of Japan at the end of World War II, the islands of Taiwan and Penghu were placed under the governance of the Republic of China (ROC), ruled by the Kuomintang (KMT), on 25 October 1945. Following the February 28 massacre in 1947, martial law was declared in 1949 by the Governor of Taiwan, Chen Cheng, and the ROC Ministry of National Defense.  Following the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the ROC government retreated from the mainland as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The KMT retreated to Taiwan and declared Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC. For many years, the ROC and PRC each continued to claim in the diplomatic arena to be the sole legitimate government of ""China"". In 1971, the United Nations expelled the ROC and replaced it with the PRC.
In 1987, martial law was lifted and Taiwan began a democratisation process, beginning with the abolition of the Temporary Provisions and culminating with the first direct president election in 1996. By 2000, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power and began to pursue Taiwanese independence and identity.
Due to Taiwan's ambiguous political status, the ROC has participated in a number of international organizations under the name ""Chinese Taipei"". Under its One-China policy, the PRC holds that the ROC ceased to exist and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the PRC despite the fact that it has never controlled the island. Moreover, the PRC refuses diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC. However, the ROC still controls Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, Lienchiang, and other minor islands.

Chronology
Early postwar society
The Second World War's hostilities came to a close on 2 September 1945, with the defeat of the Empire of Japan and Nazi Germany. Taiwan, which had been ceded to Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, was placed under the control of the Kuomintang-led Republic of China (ROC) by the promulgation of General Order No. 1 and the signing of the Instrument of Surrender on that day.
He Yingqin, the ROC representative at the Japanese surrender ceremonies, established the Office of the Chief Executive of Taiwan Province separate from the provincial-level executive system on mainland China. After the establishment of the provincial executive office, Chen Yi was appointed Chief Executive. Chen proclaimed 25 October to be Retrocession Day. However, because Japan had not formally relinquished the sovereignty of Taiwan at that time, Allies of World War II did not recognize the unilateral annexation of Taiwan by the Republic of China.
Chen Yi's administration was marred by corruption, as well as a lack of discipline in the military police assigned to occupation duties, resulting in a severe undermining of the chain of command. With the rampant corruption in his administration, Chen Yi began to monopolize power. In addition to this, the island's post-wa",history
Pesäpallo,"Pesäpallo (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈpesæˌpɑlːo]; literally meaning ""nest ball"", Swedish: Boboll, colloquially known in Finnish as pesis and also referred to as Finnish baseball) is a fast-moving bat-and-ball sport that is often referred to as the national sport of Finland and has some presence in other places including Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, and Canada's  northern Ontario (the latter two countries have significant Nordic populations). It is similar to brännboll, rounders, lapta, and baseball.
Pesäpallo, a combination of traditional ball-batting team games and North American baseball, was invented by Lauri ""Tahko"" Pihkala in the 1920s. It has changed with the times and grown in popularity. On 14 November 1920, it was played the first time at Kaisaniemi Park in Helsinki.
The basic idea of pesäpallo is similar to that of baseball: the offense tries to score by hitting the ball successfully and running through the bases, while the defense tries to put the batter and runners out. One of the most important differences between pesäpallo and baseball is that the ball is pitched vertically, which makes hitting the ball, as well as controlling the power and direction of the hit, much easier. This gives the offensive game more variety, speed, and tactical aspects compared to baseball. The fielding team is forced to counter the batter's choices with defensive schemes and anticipation.
The manager has an important role in pesäpallo, leading the offense by giving signals to the players using a multicoloured fan. The defensive team play is directed by the manager's orders and hand signals by the fielders.
Pesäpallo was a demonstration sport at the 1952 Summer Olympics, held in Helsinki, Finland.

Rules
A regular pesäpallo game is played in two periods of four innings each. A period is won by the team which scores more runs in its offensive half-innings. If the periods are tied, there will be an extra inning; if needed, there is a round (similar to a penalty shoot-out) where each team tries to bring a player home from the third base.
During an inning, both teams take turns playing offense (batting) and defense (fielding).
The defensive team has nine players on the field. The offensive team can use three jokers (similar to designated hitters) during one half-inning in addition to the nine players in the regular batting order. The offensive team can continue batting until three players have been put out or one round of the batting order has been completed without at least two runs scored. The batter and the pitcher face each other in the home base, on opposite sides of the circular plate. The pitch is delivered by throwing the ball directly upwards above the plate, at least one meter over the head of the pitcher.
The batter has three strikes available during their turn at bat. A fair hit does not require the batter to reach base; all three strikes can be used before the batter must reach first base. A pitch counts as a strike if the batter takes ",sports
Food science,"Food science (or bromatology) is the basic science and applied science of food; its scope starts at overlap with agricultural science and nutritional science and leads through the scientific aspects of food safety and food processing, informing the development of food technology.
Food science brings together multiple scientific disciplines. It incorporates concepts from fields such as chemistry, physics, physiology, microbiology, and biochemistry. Food technology incorporates concepts from chemical engineering, for example.
Activities of food scientists include the development of new food products, design of processes to produce these foods, choice of packaging materials, shelf-life studies, sensory evaluation of products using survey panels or potential consumers, as well as microbiological and chemical testing. Food scientists may study more fundamental phenomena that are directly linked to the production of food products and its properties.

Definition
The Institute of Food Technologists defines food science as ""the discipline in which the engineering, biological, and physical sciences are used to study the nature of foods, the causes of deterioration, the principles underlying food processing, and the improvement of foods for the consuming public"". The textbook Food Science defines food science in simpler terms as ""the application of sciences and engineering to study the physical, chemical, and biochemical nature of foods and the principles of food processing"".

Disciplines
Some of the subdisciplines of food science are described below.

Food chemistry
Food chemistry is the study of chemical processes and interactions of all biological and non-biological components of foods. The biological substances include such items as meat, poultry, lettuce, beer, and milk.
It is similar to biochemistry in its main components such as carbohydrates, lipids, and protein, but it also includes areas such as water, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, food additives, flavors, and colors. This discipline also encompasses how products change under certain food processing techniques and ways either to enhance or to prevent them from happening.

Food physical chemistry
Food physical chemistry is the study of both physical and chemical interactions in foods in terms of physical and chemical principles applied to food systems, as well as the application of physicochemical techniques and instrumentation for the study and analysis of foods.

Food engineering
Food engineering is the industrial processes used to manufacture food. It involves coming up with novel approaches for manufacturing, packaging, delivering, ensuring quality, ensuring safety, and devising techniques to transform raw ingredients into wholesome food options.

Food microbiology
Food microbiology is the study of the microorganisms that inhabit, create, or contaminate food, including the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage.  ""Good"" bacteria, however, such as probiotics, are becoming increasingly impo",science
Beach handball,"Beach handball is a team sport where two teams pass and bounce or roll a ball, trying to throw it in the goal of the opposing team. The game is similar to standard handball, but it is played on sand instead of on a solid floor. Because the ball loses most of its bounce on sand, there is little to no dribbling, and players instead perform more passing as the rules of travelling still apply.

Description
Matches are played as two 10-minute sets, with a half-time of 5 minutes. If teams are tied at the end of a regular set then the teams play for a golden goal. If the teams are tied at the end of 2 sets then the teams will participate in a tiebreaker. The tie break involves a goalie throwing the ball to their own player while that player attempts to score one-on-one with the opposing goalie. During regular play, if the goalkeeper scores a goal this counts as two points, compared to a normal goal scored by an outfield player which counts as 1 point. Creative or spectacular goals, such as 360-degree jumps and alley-oops, are awarded with two points, as well as in-flights and 6-meter throws.
The first European Championships was played in the year 2000.
As of September 2014, Brazil is ranked the number 1 country in the world, and is the winner of the world championship in both men's and women's divisions at the 2014 Beach Handball World Championships.

Attire
In 2021, the Norway women's national beach handball team was fined €1500 for being improperly dressed after the women wore bike shorts instead of bikini bottoms at a European championship match in Bulgaria. Critics derided the fine and the underlying rule. Although the Norwegian Handball Federation announced they would pay the fines, pop singer Pink offered to pay for them. Later, in November 2021, the International Handball Federation changed their dress rules to allow female players to wear some kinds of shorts, specifying ""Female athletes must wear short tight pants with a close fit"".

Solar power by country,"Many countries and territories have installed significant solar power capacity into their electrical grids to supplement or provide an alternative to conventional energy sources.
Solar power plants use one of two technologies:

Photovoltaic (PV) systems use solar panels, either on rooftops or in ground-mounted solar farms, converting sunlight directly into electric power.
Concentrated solar power (CSP, also known as ""concentrated solar thermal"") plants use solar thermal energy to make steam, that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine.
The worldwide growth of photovoltaics is extremely dynamic and varies strongly by country. In April 2022, the total global solar power capacity reached 1 TW. In 2022, the leading country for solar power was China, with about 390 GW, accounting for nearly two-fifths of the total global installed solar capacity. As of 2022, there are more than 40 countries around the world with a cumulative PV capacity of more than one gigawatt, including Canada, South Africa, Chile, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Austria, Argentina and the Philippines.
The top installers of 2022 included China, the United States, and India. Japan, Brazil, the Netherlands, France, Mexico and Germany were also among the top installers of 2022. The available solar PV capacity in Australia is now sufficient to supply more than 15% of the nation's electrical energy while Honduras, Italy, Spain, Germany and Greece can produce between 9% and 14% of their respective annual domestic electricity consumption.
After an almost two decade long hiatus, the deployment of CSP resumed in 2007.
However, the design for several new projects is being changed to cheaper photovoltaics.
Most operational CSP stations are located in Spain and the United States, while large solar farms using photovoltaics are being constructed in an expanding list of geographic regions. Other countries, like Finland, Denmark, Israel, Ukraine and Algeria, can also produce any portions of their electricity consumption.

The following table lists these data for each country:

Archaeological science,"Archaeological science consists of the application of scientific techniques to the analysis of archaeological materials and sites. It is related to methodologies of archaeology.  Martinón-Torres and Killick distinguish ‘scientific archaeology’ (as an epistemology) from ‘archaeological science’ (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials). Martinón-Torres and Killick claim that ‘archaeological science’ has promoted the development of high-level  theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality.
In the United Kingdom, the Natural and Environmental Research Council provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology.

Types of archaeological science
Archaeological science can be divided into the following areas:

physical and chemical dating methods which provide archaeologists with absolute and relative chronologies
artifact studies
environmental approaches which provide information on past landscapes, climates, flora, and fauna; as well as the diet, nutrition, health, and pathology of people
mathematical methods for data treatment (including computer-based methods)
remote-sensing and geophysical-survey techniques for buried features
conservation sciences, involving the study of decay processes and the development of new methods of conservation
Techniques such as lithic analysis, archaeometallurgy, paleoethnobotany, palynology and zooarchaeology also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science.

Dating techniques
Archaeological science has particular value when it can provide absolute dates for archaeological strata and artifacts. Some of the most important dating techniques include:

radiocarbon dating — especially for dating organic materials
dendrochronology — for dating trees; also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates
thermoluminescence dating — for dating inorganic material (including ceramics)
optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) — for absolutely dating and relatively profiling buried land-surfaces in vertical and horizontal stratigraphic sections, most often by measuring photons discharged from grains of quartz within sedimentary bodies (although this technique can also measure potassium feldspars, complications caused by internally induced dose-rates often favor the use of quartz-based analyzes in archaeological applications)
electron spin resonance, as used (for example) in dating teeth
potassium-argon dating — for dating (for example) fossilized hominid remains by association with volcanic sediments (the fossils themselves are not directly dated)

Artifact studies
Another important subdiscipline of archaeometry is the study of artifacts. Archaeometrists have used a variety of methods to analyze artifacts, either to determine more about their composition, or to determine their provenance. These techniques include:

X-ray fluorescence (XRF)

Surgical staple,"Surgical staples are specialized staples used in surgery in place of sutures to close skin wounds or to resect and/or connect parts of an organ (e.g. bowels, stomach or lungs). The use of staples over sutures reduces the local inflammatory response, width of the wound, and time it takes to close a defect.
A more recent development, from the 1990s, uses clips instead of staples for some applications; this does not require the staple to penetrate.

History
The technique was pioneered by ""father of surgical stapling"", Hungarian surgeon Hümér Hültl.  Hultl's prototype stapler of 1908 weighed 8 pounds (3.6 kg), and required two hours to assemble and load.
The technology was refined in the 1950s in the Soviet Union, allowing for the first commercially produced re-usable stapling devices for creation of bowel and anastomoses. Mark M. Ravitch brought a sample of stapling device after attending a surgical conference in USSR, and introduced it to entrepreneur Leon C. Hirsch, who founded the United States Surgical Corporation in 1964 to manufacture surgical staplers under its Auto Suture brand. Until the late 1970s USSC had the market essentially to itself, but in 1977 Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon brand entered the market and today both are widely used, along with competitors from the Far East.  USSC was bought by Tyco Healthcare in 1998, which became Covidien on June 29, 2007.
Safety and patency of mechanical (stapled) bowel anastomoses has been widely studied.  It is generally the case in such studies that sutured anastomoses are either comparable or less prone to leakage.  It is possible that this is the result of recent advances in suture technology, along with increasingly risk-conscious surgical practice.  Certainly modern synthetic sutures are more predictable and less prone to infection than catgut, silk and linen, which were the main suture materials used up to the 1990s.
One key feature of intestinal staplers is that the edges of the stapler act as a haemostat, compressing the edges of the wound and closing blood vessels during the stapling process. Recent studies have shown that with current suturing techniques there is no significant difference in outcome between hand sutured and mechanical anastomoses (including clips), but mechanical anastomoses are significantly quicker to perform.
In patients that are subjected to pulmonary resections where lung tissue is sealed with staplers, there is often postoperative air leakage. Alternative techniques to seal lung tissue are currently investigated.

Types and applications
The first commercial staplers were made of stainless steel with titanium staples loaded into reloadable staple cartridges.
Modern surgical staplers are either disposable and made of plastic, or reusable and made of stainless steel.  Both types are generally loaded using disposable cartridges.
The staple line may be straight, curved or circular.  Circular staplers are used for end-to-end anastomosis after bowel resection or, somewhat mo",medicine
Alimenta,"The alimenta was a Roman welfare program that existed from around 98 AD to 272 AD. It was probably introduced by Nerva and was later expanded by Trajan.  It was designed to subsidise orphans and poor children throughout Italy, but nowhere else, with a cash income, food and subsidized education. The program was an Imperial gift, supported during Trajan's reign by booty from his Dacian wars and estate taxes on landowners. Landowners who registered to contribute received a lump sum from the imperial treasury as a loan, and were expected to repay a given proportion annually, as their contribution to a charitable fund. The program was likely terminated by emperor Aurelian.

Goals
Although the system is well documented in literary sources and contemporary epigraphy, its precise aims are disputed by modern scholars. Some assume that the program was intended to bolster citizen numbers in Italy, a continuation of Augustus' moral legislation (Lex Julia), which favoured procreation on moral grounds. This was openly acknowledged by Pliny. He wrote that the recipients of the alimenta were supposed to populate ""the barracks and the tribes"" as future soldiers and electors. In reality, both these roles were ill-fitted to an empire ruled as an autocracy, no longer centered exclusively on Rome or Italy, nor exclusively reliant on  purely Roman or Italian civil and military manpower. The scheme's restriction to Italy suggests that it might have been conceived as a form of political privilege accorded to the original heartland of the empire. According to the French historian Paul Petit, the alimenta should be seen as part of a set of measures aimed towards the economic recovery of Italy. Finley thinks that the scheme's chief aim was the artificial bolstering of the political weight of Italy, as seen, for example, in the stricture — heartily praised by Pliny — laid down by Trajan that ordered all senators, even when from the provinces, to have at least a third of their landed estates in Italian territory, as it was ""unseemly [...] that [they] should treat Rome and Italy not as their native land, but as a mere inn or lodging house"".

Scope
""Interesting and unique"" as Finley finds the scheme, it remained small. It relied on regular interest repayments by landholders – mostly large ones, who were assumed to be more reliable debtors. It actually benefited very few potential recipients. Paul Veyne assumed that in the city of Veleia, only one child out of ten was an actual beneficiary. Reliance solely on loans to great landowners (in Veleia, only some 17 square kilometres were mortgaged) restricted funding sources even further. It seems that the mortgage scheme was simply a way of making local notables participate, albeit in a lesser role, in imperial benevolence. Moses I. Finley sees the alimenta as little more than a form of random charity, an additional imperial benevolence. It is possible that the scheme was, to some extent, a forced loan, something that tied unwilling",economics

Political efficacy,"In political science, political efficacy is the citizens' trust in their ability to change the government and belief that they can understand and influence political affairs. It is commonly measured by surveys and is used as an indicator for the broader health of civil society. 
It is closely related to political responsiveness, the degree to which politicians and policymakers actually do respond to voters' beliefs and preferences.

Concept
It was introduced by Angus Campbell, Gerald Gurin, Hans Emil Schroeder (also known for his beer drinking ability, and how hard he tries to stop taking snus)  and W. E. Miller during an analyses of behavior and attitude of the voters in the 1952 United States presidential election and defined as the ""feeling that individual action does have, or can have, an impact upon the political process"".
There are two types of political efficacy: 

internal efficacy: the belief that one can understand politics and therefore participate in politics
external efficacy: that the government will respond to one's demands
Political efficacy is viewed as a ""pre-condition for political engagement and is considered as a vital social characteristic within democratic societies.""
Proportional representation shows higher political efficacy compared to plurality and majoritarian systems. Wasted votes can reduce political efficacy. Low political efficacy can lead to populism.

Ways of expression
There are multiple ways in which citizens' political efficacy can be expressed: through the media, by having the right to protest, by being able to create petitions, and by having free and fair elections. The feeling that a citizen is powerless in their own country may lead to political cynicism or outright violence, which are side effects of having low political efficacy in society. Citizens' political efficacy can also be expressed online through social media outlets as ""media use – and news consumption in particular – enhances efficacy, public affairs knowledge, and civic engagement"".
Feelings of efficacy are highly correlated with participation in social and political life; however, studies have not shown any relationship between public confidence in government or political leaders and voting. Political efficacy was found to polarize policy preferences. People with relatively high efficacy were found to express policy preferences that are more in line with their ideological orientation and more extreme; and people with low efficacy tend to express more moderate policy preferences. These results were in both experimental and observational studies. Efficacy usually increases with age.

Peteca,"Peteca (Portuguese pronunciation: [peˈtɛkɐ]) is a traditional sport in Brazil, played with a ""hand shuttlecock"" from indigenous origins and reputed to be as old as the country itself. The same name is given to the shuttlecock-object itself.

Objectives
The objective of the game is to hit the shuttlecock-like object (the peteca) with your hand over a high net, similar to a volleyball net, causing the object to land inbounded on the opposite court. The peteca can only be hit once while on each side of the net. Doubles and singles, male and/or female matches are played, both for competitive or leisure purposes.

History
The word peteca is derived from the Tupian word petek meaning hit (with the open palm). Over time, the word found its way into the Portuguese language.
Originally, peteca was played at times of celebration with dances and songs. Gradually, this play became more of a sporting activity. The game has been passed down through several generations by the Brazilian ancestors and has developed considerably along the way.
Early petecas were home-made affairs consisting of stones wrapped in leaves tied inside an ear of corn. A more sophisticated version was described in a Brazilian-English dictionary as ""a leather pad with feathers stuck into it.""
Pictures of the first petecas are few and far between, but on 30 May 1979, Brazil issued a set of four postage stamps depicting children's toys, to commemorate the International Year of the Child.
When Brazil was present at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium the Brazilian athletes took with them some shuttlecocks for amusement on the ship and during the intervals between games. The game of peteca fascinated athletes from many other countries who wanted learn the rules of the game. The problem was that there were no rules - it was just for pleasure.
Peteca left the streets, the grass and the sand to become a field sport in Belo Horizonte in the 1940s.
It was in Belo Horizonte, the capital city of Minas Gerais state, that the toy shape was transformed to its current format, proper for competitive games. The typical peteca has four white chicken feathers attached to a base and connected to a bottom made with several thin layers of rubber. It was also in Belo Horizonte that the rules of the game were first written, as well as the first courts were built and the practice gained competitive sense with internal championships that were held in various social clubs of the city.
In 1973 the Peteca Federation of Minas Gerais (FEMP) was founded, confirming the pioneering spirit of a sport born and developed among the Brazilian people. From Belo Horizonte, the practice has spread to other Brazilian states, and from there to other countries, like France, that adopted the game as it is played in Brazil.
Peteca is now one of Brazil's fastest growing sports closely behind football and volleyball. Another version of the game, called Indiaca, and closely based on peteca has developed in Germany, first appeari",sports
Nature (journal),"Nature is a British weekly scientific journal founded and based in London, England. As a multidisciplinary publication, Nature features peer-reviewed research from a variety of academic disciplines, mainly in science and technology. It has core editorial offices across the United States, continental Europe, and Asia under the international scientific publishing company Springer Nature. Nature was one of the world's most cited scientific journals by the Science Edition of the 2022 Journal Citation Reports (with an ascribed impact factor of 50.5), making it one of the world's most-read and most prestigious academic journals. As of 2012, it claimed an online readership of about three million unique readers per month.
Founded in autumn 1869, Nature was first circulated by Norman Lockyer and Alexander MacMillan as a public forum for scientific innovations. The mid-20th century facilitated an editorial expansion for the journal; Nature redoubled its efforts in explanatory and scientific journalism. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the creation of a network of editorial offices outside of Britain and the establishment of ten new supplementary, speciality publications (e.g. Nature Materials). Since the late 2000s, dedicated editorial and current affairs columns are created weekly, and electoral endorsements are featured. The primary source of the journal remains, as established at its founding, research scientists; editing standards are primarily concerned with technical readability. Each issue also features articles that are of general interest to the scientific community, namely business, funding, scientific ethics, and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories.
The main research published in Nature consists mostly of papers (articles or letters) in lightly edited form. They are highly technical and dense, but, due to imposed text limits, they are typically summaries of larger work. Innovations or breakthroughs in any scientific or technological field are featured in the journal as either letters or news articles. The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Conversely, due to the journal's exposure, it has at various times been a subject of controversy for its handling of academic dishonesty, the scientific method, and news coverage. Fewer than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication. In 2007, Nature (together with Science) received the Prince of Asturias Award for Communications and Humanity.
Nature mostly publishes research articles. Spotlight articles are not research papers but mostly news or magazine style papers and hence do not count towards impact factor nor receive similar recognition as research articles. Some spotlight articles are also paid by partners or sponsors.

Economics,"Economics () is a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.
Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. Microeconomics analyses what is viewed as basic elements within economies, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyses economies as systems where production, distribution, consumption, savings, and investment expenditure interact; and the factors of production affecting them, such as: labour, capital, land, and enterprise, inflation, economic growth, and public policies that impact these elements. It also seeks to analyse and describe the global economy.
Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing ""what is"", and normative economics, advocating ""what ought to be""; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics.
Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, including business, finance, cybersecurity, health care, engineering and government. It is also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, feminism, law, philosophy, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, and the environment.

Definitions of economics
The earlier term for the discipline was ""political economy"", but since the late 19th century, it has commonly been called ""economics"". The term is ultimately derived from Ancient Greek οἰκονομία (oikonomia) which is a term for the ""way (nomos) to run a household (oikos)"", or in other words the know-how of an οἰκονομικός (oikonomikos), or ""household or homestead manager"". Derived terms such as ""economy"" can therefore often mean ""frugal"" or ""thrifty"". By extension then, ""political economy"" was the way to manage a polis or state.
There are a variety of modern definitions of economics; some reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists. Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1776) defined what was then called political economy as ""an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations"", in particular as:

a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [with the twofold objectives of providing] a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people ... [and] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services.
Jean-Baptiste Say (1803), distinguishing the subject matter from its public-policy uses, defined it as the science of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth. On the satirical side, Thomas Carlyle (1849) coined ""the dismal science"" as an epithet for classical economics, in this context, commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of Malthus (1798). John Stuart Mill (1844) delimited the subject matter further:

Logic,"Logic is the study of correct reasoning. It includes both formal and informal logic. Formal logic is the study of deductively valid inferences or logical truths. It examines how conclusions follow from premises based on the structure of arguments alone, independent of their topic and content. Informal logic is associated with informal fallacies, critical thinking, and argumentation theory. Informal logic examines arguments expressed in natural language whereas formal logic uses formal language. When used as a countable noun, the term ""a logic"" refers to a specific logical formal system that articulates a proof system. Logic plays a central role in many fields, such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.
Logic studies arguments, which consist of a set of premises that leads to a conclusion. An example is the argument from the premises ""it's Sunday"" and ""if it's Sunday then I don't have to work"" leading to the conclusion ""I don't have to work."" Premises and conclusions express propositions or claims that can be true or false. An important feature of propositions is their internal structure. For example, complex propositions are made up of simpler propositions linked by logical vocabulary like 
  
    
      
        ∧
      
    
    {\displaystyle \land }
  
 (and) or 
  
    
      
        →
      
    
    {\displaystyle \to }
  
 (if...then). Simple propositions also have parts, like ""Sunday"" or ""work"" in the example. The truth of a proposition usually depends on the meanings of all of its parts. However, this is not the case for logically true propositions. They are true only because of their logical structure independent of the specific meanings of the individual parts.
Arguments can be either correct or incorrect. An argument is correct if its premises support its conclusion. Deductive arguments have the strongest form of support: if their premises are true then their conclusion must also be true. This is not the case for ampliative arguments, which arrive at genuinely new information not found in the premises. Many arguments in everyday discourse and the sciences are ampliative arguments. They are divided into inductive and abductive arguments. Inductive arguments are statistical generalizations, such as inferring that all ravens are black based on many individual observations of black ravens. Abductive arguments are inferences to the best explanation, for example, when a doctor concludes that a patient has a certain disease which explains the symptoms they suffer. Arguments that fall short of the standards of correct reasoning often embody fallacies. Systems of logic are theoretical frameworks for assessing the correctness of arguments.
Logic has been studied since antiquity. Early approaches include Aristotelian logic, Stoic logic, Nyaya, and Mohism. Aristotelian logic focuses on reasoning in the form of syllogisms. It was considered the main system of logic in the Western world until it was replaced by modern for",science
Prices paid index,"The Prices paid index is an index that measures changes in the prices paid for goods and services used in crop and livestock production and family living. The production component of the index accounts for over 65% of the total, and family living expenses represented by the CPI-U account for less than 20% of the index. The remaining components are interest charges on farm real estate and non-real estate debt, taxes payable on farm real estate, and wage rates paid to hired farm labor. NASS currently publishes the index on a 1990-92 = 100 base. Used in calculating the federal grazing fee, among other purposes. The index of prices paid on a 1910-14 = 100 base is called the parity index and is used in calculating the parity ratio.

Medical Device Regulation Act,"The Medical Device Regulation Act or Medical Device Amendments of 1976 was introduced by the 94th Congress of the United States. Congressman Paul G. Rogers and Senator Edward M. Kennedy were the chairperson sponsors of the medical device amendments. The Title 21 amendments were signed into law on May 28, 1976, by the 38th President of the United States Gerald R. Ford.
The U.S. legislation enacted in 1976 amended the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 signed by the 32nd President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt.

History
During the 1960s, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) commissioned the Cooper Committee to study the adverse effects of medical devices for human use. In 1970, the study committee recommended a classification for medical devices based on comparative risk. In 1976, the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device injured at least 900,000 women in the United States, which aided the emphasis for regulatory oversight and therapeutic requirements provided by the U.S. legislation P.L. 94-295.

Provisions of the Act
Classification of Medical Devices
There are three classifications for medical devices:

Class I - General Controls for devices considered as low risks for human use.
Medical device has sufficient information to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. Medical device is not to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life, for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, and does not present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
Class II - Performance Standards for devices considered as moderate risks for human use.
Medical device has insufficient information to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. Medical device cannot be classified as a class I device because the controls authorized are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. Medical device has sufficient information to establish a performance standard and it is necessary to establish a performance standard for the device.
Class III - Premarket Approval for devices considered as high risks for human use.
Medical device cannot be classified as a class I device because insufficient information exists to determine that the controls authorized are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. Medical device cannot be classified as a class II device because insufficient information exists for the establishment of a performance standard to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness of the device. Medical device is to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life, of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury, is to be subject, premarket approval to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness.

LAMA2 related congenital muscular dystrophy,"LAMA2 muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD) is a genetically determined muscle disease caused by pathogenic mutations in the LAMA2 gene. It is a subtype of a larger group of genetic muscle diseases known collectively as congenital muscular dystrophies. The clinical presentation of LAMA2-MD varies according to the age at presentation. The severe forms present at birth and are known as early onset LAMA2 congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A or MDC1A.  The mild forms are known as late onset LAMA2 muscular dystrophy or late onset LAMA2-MD. The nomenclature LGMDR23 can be used interchangeably with late onset LAMA2-MD.
Suggestive clinical features include, muscular hyperlaxity or hypotonia, growth retardation progressive spine and joint contractures, and cardiac and respiratory failure.
For consensus, generally, the term congenital muscular dystrophy refers to a diverse group of childhood onset muscle diseases -usually occurring the first two years of life- and mostly inherited through an autosomal recessive mode. Congenital muscular dystrophies have known phenotype-genotype profiles and produce muscle degenerative pathology.

Symptoms and signs
There are two types of LAMA2 muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD).  The first type is the congenital type known as early onset LAMA2 congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A or MDC1A. It presents at birth and has a relatively severe clinical presentation. Characteristically it manifests in muscle weakness, hyperlaxity or hypotonia, respiratory difficulties and developmental delay.    
The second type is the late onset LAMA2 muscular dystrophy or late onset LAMA2-MD. The age of presentation of late onset LAMA2-MD ranges from early childhood to adulthood. It usually has a mild clinical presentation in the form of progressive spine and joint contractures, and cardiac and respiratory failure.

Musculoskeletal manifestations
Delayed development of motor milestones as loss of ambulatory capacity is usually more severe in the congenital type 1A or MDC1A. Skeletal muscle weakness is a characteristic feature. It more evident in the proximal muscles of the extremities. Facial and neck weakness have also been reported. Scoliosis is a side curvature or abnormal deviation of the spine with an element of rotation. Scoliosis is usually rigid and progressive. It may be accompanied by lordosis.
The clinical orthopedic features of congenital type 1A (MDC1A) in terms of type, distribution, laterality, deformity progression, chronological order of muscle and joint involvement etc., have shown a fairly characteristic pattern. This is important to the differential diagnosis of LAMA2-MD and other subtypes of congenital muscular dystrophies among others. LAMA2-MD especially MDC1A, usually manifests in progressive contractures of large joints like knees, ankles, elbow and hips. Contractures tend to be bilateral. That is involving both the left and right sides. Observing the chronological order of development of joint contractures, namely early versus la",medicine

Anti-defection law (India),"The Anti-Defection law, or the 52nd Amendment to the Indian Constitution is a constitutional amendment limiting the ability of politicians to switch parties in parliament. The Constitution was amended to prevent elected MLAs and MPs from changing parties.
Before the introduction of the anti-defection law, the election of both the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers of some of its states and territories had experienced instances of perceived uncertainty resulting from legislators changing their political allegiance. It may be noted that the 'political party' was not a recognised word in the Constitution of India at that time.  By one estimate, almost 50 percent of the 4,000 legislators elected to central and federal parliaments in the 1967 and 1971 general elections subsequently defected, leading to political turmoil in the country.
The law was sought to limit such defections in India. In 1985, the Tenth Schedule of the 52nd Amendment to the Constitution of India was passed by the Parliament of India to achieve this, which resulted in the introduction of the new word 'Political Party' in the Constitution of India.  Thus, political parties got recognition in the Constitution.
Following recommendations from many constitutional bodies, Parliament in 2003 passed the Ninety-first Amendment to the Constitution of India. This strengthened the act by adding provisions for the disqualification of defectors and banning them from being appointed as ministers for a period of time.

Background
Beginning in the 1960s, the rise of coalition politics increased the incidence of defections as elected representatives sought to occupy a berth in the cabinet of ministers. (It may be noted that in many countries, including the UK, a Government minister does not have to be a member of either House of Parliament) As an example, in 1967 a legislator Gaya Lal changed his allegiance three times in a single day, and gave rise to the infamous expression Aaya Ram Gaya Ram (""Ram has come, Ram has gone"").
Between 1957 and 1967, the Congress (I) party emerged as the sole beneficiary of defections. It lost 98 of its legislators but gained 419, whilst those who left other parties and who did not then join Congress (I) formed separate new parties with the aim of exerting power on administration in the future through coalition government, rather than supporting established administration. This situation gave Congress (I) a strong hold of power on the administration. In the 1967 elections, approximately 3,500 members were elected to legislative assemblies of various states and union territories; out of those elected representatives, around 550 subsequently defected from their parent parties, and some legislatives crossed the floor more than once.
To tackle the scourge of political party defection, during the fourth Lok Sabha in 1967 a committee was formed under the chairmanship of Y. B. Chavan. This committee submitted a report in 1968 which led to a first attempt to submit an anti-def",politics
Caucus,"A caucus is a group or meeting of supporters or members of a specific political party or movement. The exact definition varies between different countries and political cultures.
The term originated in the United States, where it can refer to a meeting of members of a political party to nominate candidates, plan policy, etc., in the United States Congress, or other similar representative organs of government. It has spread to certain Commonwealth countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, where it generally refers to a regular meeting of all members of Parliament (MPs) who belong to a parliamentary party: a party caucus may have the ability to elect or dismiss the party's parliamentary leader. The term was used historically in the United Kingdom to refer to the Liberal Party's internal system of management and control.

Etymology
The word caucus came into use in the British colonies of North America to describe clubs or private meetings at which political matters were discussed. It is first found in reference to the Caucus Club of Boston, which was established in c.1719, although the name is not documented until c.1760. There are three main theories for the word's origins:

Native American
James Hammond Trumbull suggested to the American Philological Association that the word comes from an Algonquian word for ""counsel"", cau´-cau-as´u. It might also derive from the Algonquian cawaassough, meaning an advisor, talker, or orator. This explanation was favored by Charles Dudley Warner.
Drinking associations
The American Heritage Dictionary suggests that the word possibly derives from medieval Latin caucus, meaning ""drinking vessel"", such as might have been used for the flip drunk at the Caucus Club (see John Adams quotation below). The appearance of the term coincides with the spreading in England – and therefore also in America – of the inns called cocues because they were places to drink the new cheap liquor called ""gin"" or ""cuckoo liquor"", since it was obtained from the distillation of so-called ""cuckoo barley""; namely, barley sown very late in the spring and therefore unsuitable for the brewing of beer. That caucuses were places where people drank abundantly is attested by Obadiah Benjamin Franklin Bloomfield in his autobiography: ""Richard had set out hospitably [...] A caucus had been accordingly held by these worthies, and it was resolved nem. con. that they should first make a drunkard of him, and then pluck him, aye, even of the last feather.""
Shipbuilding
A third theory is that the word is a corruption of ""caulkers"" (i.e., persons who apply caulk), in the sense of shipbuilders. This derivation was suggested by John Pickering in 1816 in A Vocabulary; or, Collection of Words and Phrases Which Have Been Supposed to Be Peculiar to the U.S. of America. It was later adopted by Noah Webster and also appears in an article of 1896 on the origins of the caucus – in all cases citing the 1788 passage by William Gordon quoted be",politics
Indigo Era,"The Indigo Era (or Indigo economies) is a concept publicized by businessman Mikhail Fridman, describing what he views as an emerging new era of economies and economics based on ideas, innovation, and creativity, replacing those based on the possession of natural resources. Fridman is the co-founder of LetterOne, an international investment business, and first publicized the idea in early 2016. The word ""indigo"" was initially chosen based on the term indigo children, which has been used to describe people with unusual and innovative abilities.
Fridman describes the Indigo Era as a disruptive era driven by extraordinary levels of human creativity, where abnormally talented individuals and entities are able to realize new levels of human potential and economic achievement. It is ""a new economic era where the main source of national wealth is no longer resource rent but the socio-economic infrastructure that allows every person to realise his or her intellectual or creative potential."" But, according to Fridman – based on his observations of recent economic indicators, political and market volatility, and historical patterns – it is also an era that will generate winners and losers as lagging countries and groups fail to adapt quickly enough.
In late 2016 LetterOne's Global Perspectives journal published an Indigo Index, ranking 152 countries on their ability to compete and grow as economies move away from being powered by natural resources to being powered by ideas, creativity, and digital skills. In 2017 it launched the Indigo Prize, to award new concepts of economic measurement beyond mere GDP as countries in the 21st century transition into economies where innovation, creativity, and digital skills are economic drivers. The competition is intended to ""stimulate debate about factors currently measured, given evolving economies, technology and skill bases, and what should now be taken into consideration in official economic statistics that measure the health, size and growth of a modern economy.""

Origin
In an April 2016 article in RealClearPolitics and reprinted in the Jerusalem Post, Fridman wrote:

We are entering a disruptive era driven by extraordinary levels of human creativity. A new generation of curious, strong-willed and talented individuals is unhindered by convention or the past. This new “Indigo” generation is now shaping tomorrow's economy and creating national wealth. I use the term Indigo because it has been used to refer to children with special or unusual abilities. This is an era where abnormally talented individuals and entities are now able to realize new levels of human potential and economic achievement.
LetterOne's Global Perspectives website adds that the indigo symbolism ""embodies a breaking of the norm, something that is highly reflective of the new era that we are entering into, one that lacks convention and is driven by innovation.""

Big business,"Big business involves large-scale corporate-controlled financial or business activities. As a term, it describes activities that run from ""huge transactions"" to the more general ""doing big things"". In corporate jargon, the concept is commonly known as enterprise, or activities involving enterprise customers.
The concept first rose in a symbolic sense after 1880 in connection with the combination movement that began in American business at that time. Some examples of American corporations that fall into the category of ""big business"" as of 2015 are ExxonMobil, Walmart, Google, Microsoft, Apple, General Electric, General Motors, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs; in the United States, big businesses in general are sometimes collectively pejoratively called ""corporate America"". The largest German corporations as of 2012 included Daimler AG, Deutsche Telekom, Siemens, and Deutsche Bank. SAP is Germany's largest software company. Among the largest companies in the United Kingdom as of 2012 are HSBC, Barclays, WPP plc, and BP. The latter half of the 19th century saw more technological advances and corporate growth in additional sectors, such as petroleum, machinery, chemicals, and electrical equipment (see Second Industrial Revolution).
In the sphere of enterprise software, beyond the functional level, an enterprise edition would emphasize institutional concerns around software security, fault tolerance, geographic redundancy, disaster recovery, dispersed operational collaboration with administrative teams large enough to have internal sub-departments, and multilingual and localized functionality that spans the global marketplace. Procurement, validation and regulatory compliance of large systems at the enterprise scale often involves a multi-year planning cycle.

History
Origin of term
The Oxford English Dictionary identifies the first use of the term, in 1905, to be in ""The City: The Hope of Democracy"", Frederic C. Howe.

Early 20th century
The automotive industry began modestly in the late-19th century, but grew rapidly following the development of large-scale gasoline production in the early 20th century.

Post-World War II
The relatively stable period of rebuilding after World War II led to new technologies (some of which were spin-offs from the war years) and new businesses.

Computers
The new technology of computers spread worldwide in the post war years. Businesses built around computer technology include: IBM, Microsoft, Apple Inc., Samsung, and Intel.

Electronics
Miniaturization and integrated circuits, together with an expansion of radio and television technologies, provided fertile ground for business development. Electronics businesses include JVC, Sony (Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita), and Texas Instruments (Cecil H. Green, J. Erik Jonsson, Eugene McDermott, and Patrick E.

"Christmas Tree Promotion, Research, and Information Order","The Christmas Tree Promotion, Research, and Information Order is a provision of the 2014 U.S. Farm Bill that established a U.S. Department of Agriculture commodity checkoff program for cultivated Christmas trees. The program is funded through a $.15 per tree fee paid by growers. The program creates a marketing program similar to other checkoff programs such as ""Got Milk?"" or ""Beef. It's What's For Dinner"". The order was briefly implemented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Marketing Service in November 2011. After a wave of political criticism the rule that established the program was officially stayed before being passed into law over two years later.

Provisions
The Christmas Tree Promotion, Research, and Information Order is the U.S. Department of Agriculture rule establishing the industry-funded promotion, research and information program in support of fresh-cut Christmas trees. The order is what is known in the United States as a commodity checkoff program. It was requested by the Christmas tree growing industry as a result of declining numbers in sales and farms nationwide. The program is funded by growers and retailers through a $.15 per tree fee; growers that produce less than 500 trees per year are exempted from the fee. The fee was among the program's most publicized provisions.
While it is up to individuals whether to pass the fee on to consumers, the National Christmas Tree Association (NCTA) stated the order is not expected to affect the retail price of fresh-cut Christmas trees. The program allows farmers to allow the government to implement and oversee the program through a Christmas Tree Promotion Board and the funds collected from assessed trees. The board is made up of producers and importers. At the time the rule was proposed, the USDA had implemented more than 20 similar programs including those responsible for the well-known ""Got Milk?"", ""Beef: It's What's for Dinner"" and ""The Incredible Edible Egg"" campaigns.
The levy is expected to generate $2 million per year. The program includes a 12-member Christmas Tree Promotion Board that would directs funding from the program to promotion programs and advertising meant to show ""a favorable image of Christmas trees to the public."" The Christmas tree checkoff program also allows for a referendum among all those who paid the 15 cent per tree assessment after three years.  This referendum was designed to allow producers and importers to terminate, continue, or amend the program. The program also specified that if a fee over 20 cents per tree or under 10 cents per tree it would require the approval of the majority of producers and importers.

History
Between 1991 and 2007 natural, fresh-cut Christmas tree production in the U.S. declined from 37 million to 31 million. Meanwhile, the artificial Christmas tree industry saw it sale increase dramatically between 2003 and 2007.

Kin-Ball,"Kin-Ball is a team sport created in Quebec, Canada, in 1986 by Mario Demers, a physical education professor.
The main distinctive characteristics are the large size of the ball (1.2m (48 inches) in diameter) and that the matches are played by three teams at the same time.
The International Kin-Ball Federation counts 3.8 million participants, primarily from Canada, the U.S., Japan, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Malaysia, China  and Hong Kong. The newest country is the UK with Kin-Ball UK having formed in 2018.

Game
The official Kin-Ball team colours are black, grey and blue. (Sometimes pink is used instead of blue). The Kin-Ball's diameter is 1.2 m (48 inches) and the ball weighs 1 kilogram (2.2 lb). The court size is 20×20 meters (66×66 feet; court lines are included in measurement). Three teams play per game and each team has four players.
The team in possession of the ball is the Attacking Team. To make a play, the Attacking Team will designate a Defending Team, by calling out their colour. The designation has to start with the declaration ""Omnikin!"" followed by the colour of another team. After the designation, the ball has to be hit with a body part above the hips, while all other members of the Attacking Team touch the ball, in some way. If the Defending Team is able to control the Kin-Ball successfully, it becomes the Attacking Team.
A Kin-Ball game is usually played until one team has won three periods. Each period takes about 10 minutes to play. When the first team reaches 9 points in a period, the team with the fewest points has to leave the court and the remaining two teams play until one team reaches 11 points.
A player can commit a series of fouls during the match:

Not being able to catch the ball before it touches the ground.
Hitting the ball out of bounds or stepping out of bounds while touching the ball.
Walking with the ball after the third player touches the ball during a play.
Hitting the ball with a downward trajectory.
Hitting the ball less than 1.8 meters.
Not all players of a team being in contact with the ball.
Making a mistake during the colour announcement (wrong colour, more than one player talking, etc.).
Having more than 1 player within 1.8 meters during the hit (close defense).
Intentionally interfering with a defending player.
Whenever a team commits a foul, the other two teams receive 1 point each. This ensures that teams of a lower skill level are kept in play, so long as they do not commit too many fouls of their own in a row.

Caroline era,"The Caroline era is the period in English and Scottish history named for the 24-year reign of Charles I (1625–1649). The term is derived from Carolus, Latin for Charles. The Caroline era followed the Jacobean era, the reign of Charles's father James I & VI (1603–1625), overlapped with the English Civil War (1642–1651), and was followed by the English Interregnum until The Restoration in 1660. It should not be confused with the Carolean era, which refers to the reign of Charles I's son King Charles II.
The Caroline era was dominated by growing religious, political, and social discord between the King and his supporters, termed the Royalist party, and the Parliamentarian opposition that evolved in response to particular aspects of Charles's rule. While the Thirty Years' War was raging in continental Europe, Britain had an uneasy peace, growing more restless as the civil conflict between the King and the supporters of Parliament worsened.
Despite the friction between King and Parliament dominating society, there were developments in the arts and sciences. The period also saw the colonisation of North America with the foundation of new colonies between 1629 and 1636 in Carolina, Maryland, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Development of colonies in Virginia, Massachusetts, and Newfoundland also continued. In Massachusetts, the Pequot War of 1637 was the first major armed conflict between the people of New England and the Pequot tribe.

Arts
The highest standards of the arts and architecture all flourished under the patronage of the King, although drama slipped from the previous Shakespearean age. All the arts were greatly impacted by the enormous political and religious controversies, and the degree to which they were themselves influential is a matter of ongoing debate among scholars. Patrick Collinson argues that an emerging Puritan community was highly suspicious of the fine arts. Edward Chaney argues that Catholic patrons and professionals were quite numerous and greatly influenced the direction of the arts.

Poetry
The Caroline period saw the flourishing of the cavalier poets (including Thomas Carew, Richard Lovelace, and John Suckling) and the metaphysical poets (including George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Katherine Philips), movements that produced figures like John Donne, Robert Herrick and John Milton.
Cavalier poetry differs from traditional poetry in subject matter. Instead of tackling issues such as religion, philosophy and the arts, cavalier poetry aims to express the joys and celebrations in a much livelier way than did its predecessors. The intent was often to promote the crown, and they often spoke outwardly against the Roundheads. Most cavalier works had allegorical or classical references, drawing on knowledge of Horace, Cicero, and Ovid. By using these resources they were able to produce poetry that impressed King Charles I. The cavalier poets strove to create poetry where both pleasure and virtue thrived. They were rich in reference to t",history

Econophysics,"Econophysics is a non-orthodox (in economics) interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods originally developed by physicists in order to solve problems in economics, usually those including uncertainty or stochastic processes and nonlinear dynamics. Some of its application to the study of financial markets has also been termed statistical finance referring to its roots in statistical physics. Econophysics is closely related to social physics.

History
Physicists' interest in the social sciences is not new (see e.g.,); Daniel Bernoulli, as an example, was the originator of utility-based preferences. One of the founders of neoclassical economic theory, former Yale University Professor of Economics Irving Fisher, was originally trained under the renowned Yale physicist, Josiah Willard Gibbs. Likewise, Jan Tinbergen, who won the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969 for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes, studied physics with Paul Ehrenfest at Leiden University. In particular, Tinbergen developed the gravity model of international trade that has become the workhorse of international economics.
Econophysics was started in the mid-1990s by several physicists working in the subfield of statistical mechanics.  Unsatisfied with the traditional explanations and approaches of economists – which usually prioritized simplified approaches for the sake of soluble theoretical models over agreement with empirical data – they applied tools and methods from physics, first to try to match financial data sets, and then to explain more general economic phenomena.
One driving force behind econophysics arising at this time was the sudden availability of large amounts of financial data, starting in the 1980s.  It became apparent that traditional methods of analysis were insufficient – standard economic methods dealt with homogeneous agents and equilibrium, while many of the more interesting phenomena in financial markets fundamentally depended on heterogeneous agents and far-from-equilibrium situations.
The term ""econophysics"" was coined by H. Eugene Stanley, to describe the large number of papers written by physicists in the problems of (stock and other) markets, in a conference on statistical physics in Kolkata (erstwhile Calcutta)  in 1995 and first appeared in its proceedings publication in Physica A 1996. The inaugural meeting on econophysics was organised in 1998 in Budapest by János Kertész and Imre Kondor. The first book on econophysics was by R. N. Mantegna & H. E. Stanley in  2000.
The almost regular meeting series on the topic include: Econophys-Kolkata (held in Kolkata & Delhi), Econophysics Colloquium, ESHIA/ WEHIA.

Basic tools
Basic tools of econophysics are probabilistic and statistical methods often taken from statistical physics.

Energy superpower,"An energy superpower is a country that supplies large amounts of energy resources (crude oil, natural gas, coal, etc.) to a significant number of other countries - and therefore has the potential to influence world markets for political or economic gains. Energy superpower status might be exercised, for example, by significantly influencing the price on global markets or by withholding supplies. Nowadays, the term ""energy superpower"" is increasingly used to characterize nations at the forefront of energy transition and the development of renewable energy resources.
The term ""energy superpower"" lacks a precise scholarly definition and is primarily a political term. It is not a concept rooted in rigorous academic or scientific categorization but rather a label used in political discourse to describe countries that wield significant influence in the global energy landscape. This term is subject to interpretation;and can be applied differently by individuals and organizations - depending on their specific agenda or perspectives. As a result, the meaning and applicability of the term ""energy superpower"" may vary.
As of 2024, the United States is the world's leading producer of total energy, leading producer of petroleum, leading producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and leading exporter of LNG.
Russia is widely recognized as an energy superpower. Other nations that have, at different points in time, earned this designation include Saudi Arabia, Canada, Venezuela, and Iran.

Countries referred to as energy superpowers
Russia
The discourses surrounding Russia's energy wealth play a crucial role in Vladimir Putin's attempts to restore Russia's great power status. Some scholars have noted that, although Putin may avoid explicitly using the term ""superpower,"" the idea of Russia as an energy superpower is an integral part of the ideology developed by his regime. This idea emphasizes Russia's significant role in the global energy landscape and frames it as a key player in international politics. However, Russia's status of an energy superpower and the strategic implications it carries have been called into question by many experts. As Vladimir Milov, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says:

The ""energy superpower"" concept is an illusion with no basis in reality. Perhaps most dangerously, it doesn’t recognize the mutual dependence between Russia and energy consumers. Because of political conflicts and declining production, future supply disruptions to Europe are likely. As a result, European gas companies may likely someday demand elimination of the take-or-pay conditions in their Russian contracts. This would threaten Gazprom’s ability to borrow. Putin’s attempt to use energy to increase Russian influence could backfire in the long run.Vladimir Mau, Aleksei Kudrin, German Gref, and many other Russian economists compare Russia's dependence on energy exports with a severe drug addiction and even use the “sitting on the oil needle” metaphor ",politics
Cross-cutting cleavage,"In social sciences, a cross-cutting cleavage exists when groups on  one cleavage overlap among groups on another cleavage.  ""Cleavages"" may include racial, political, and religious divisions in society. Formally, members of a group j on a given cleavage x belong to groups on a second cleavage y with members of other groups k, l, m, etc. from the first cleavage x. For example, if a society contained two ethnic groups that had equal proportions of rich and poor it would be cross-cutting. Robert A. Dahl built a theory of Pluralist democracy which is a direct descendant of Madison's cross-cutting cleavages. Cross-cutting cleavages are contrasted with reinforcing cleavage (e.g. a situation where one ethnic group is all-rich and the other is all-poor). The term originates from Simmel (1908) in his work Soziologie.

Definition
In social sciences, a cross-cutting cleavage exists when groups on  one cleavage overlap among groups on another cleavage. ""Cleavages"" may include racial, political, religious divisions in society. Formally, members of a group j on a given cleavage x belong to groups on a second cleavage y with members of other groups k, l, m, etc. from the first cleavage x. For example, if a society contained two ethnic groups that had equal proportions of rich and poor it would be cross-cutting.

History
Political philosophy
Cross-cutting cleavages are perhaps most heavily referenced in political philosophy. James Madison's commentary on the concept in Federalist No. 10 contributed substantially to the development of the idea of cross-cutting cleavages. Madison argued the fractious nature of factions would be a mechanism for political stability and prevent a tyranny of the majority. Because no group can align all members along a single cleavage, they will instead be forced to build a broad base of support by seeking the approval of many different factions, preventing a simple ""majority dictatorship"" where one group making up a bare majority could (for example) expropriate all the property of another group.
An in-depth discussion of this process is given by Seymour Martin Lipset in his 1960 book Political Man.
Cross-cutting theory was applied to such topics as social order, political violence, voting behaviour, political organization and democratic stability, for example Truman's The Governmental Process, Dahl's A Preface to Democratic Theory, among others.  Around the same time, several scholars (including Lipset himself) suggested ways to measure the concept, the best-known being Rae and Taylor's in their 1970 book The Analysis of Political Cleavages. Due to data limitations, these theories were generally left untested for a couple of decades.

Sociology
The term originates from Simmel (1908) in his work Soziologie. Anthropologists used the term heavily in the first few decades of the 20th century, as they brought back descriptions of non-Western societies throughout Asia and Africa. Peter Blau's work further refined the idea.

Ages of Man,"The Ages of Man are the historical stages of human existence according to Greek mythology and its subsequent Roman interpretation.
Both Hesiod and Ovid offered accounts of the successive ages of humanity, which tend to progress from an original, long-gone age in which humans enjoyed a nearly divine existence to the current age of the writer, in which humans are beset by innumerable pains and evils. In the two accounts that survive from Ancient Greece and Rome, this degradation of the human condition over time is indicated symbolically with metals of successively decreasing value (but increasing hardness).

Hesiod's Five Ages
The Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) outlined his Five Ages in his poem Works and Days (lines 109–201). His list is:

Golden Age – The Golden Age is the only age that falls within the rule of Cronus. Created by the immortals who live on Olympus, these humans were said to live among the gods and freely mingled with them. Peace and harmony prevailed during this age. Humans did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to very old age but with a youthful appearance and eventually died peacefully. Their spirits live on as ""guardians"". Plato in Cratylus (397e) recounts the golden race of men who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean men literally made of gold, but good and noble. He describes these men as daemons upon the Earth. Since δαίμονες (daimones) is derived from δαήμονες (daēmones, meaning knowing or wise), they are beneficent, preventing ills, and guardians of mortals.
Silver Age – The Silver Age and every age that follows fall within the rule of Cronus's successor and son, Zeus. Men in the Silver Age lived for one hundred years under the dominion of their mothers. They lived only a short time as grown adults, and spent that time in strife with one another. During this Age, men refused to worship the gods and Zeus destroyed them for their impiety. After death, humans of this age became ""blessed spirits"" of the underworld.
Bronze Age – This age is also sometimes known as the Copper Age or Brazen Age. Men of the Bronze Age were hardened and tough, as war was their purpose and passion. Zeus created these humans out of the ash tree. Their armor was forged of bronze, as were their homes and tools. The men of this Age were undone by their own violent ways and left no named spirits; instead, they dwell in the ""dark house of Hades"". This Age came to an end with the flood of Deucalion.
Heroic Age – The Heroic Age is the one age that does not correspond with any metal. It is also the only age that improves upon the age it follows. It was the heroes of this Age who fought at Thebes and Troy. This race of humans died and went to Elysium.
Iron Age – Hesiod finds himself in the Iron Age. During this age, humans live an existence of toil and misery. Children dishonor their parents, brother fights with brother, and the social contract between guest and host (xenia) is ",history
Technology and society,"Technology, society and life or technology and culture refers to the inter-dependency, co-dependence, co-influence, and co-production of technology and society upon one another. Evidence for this synergy has been found since humanity first started using simple tools. The inter-relationship has continued as modern technologies such as the printing press and computers have helped shape society. The first scientific approach to this relationship occurred with the development of tektology, the ""science of organization"", in early twentieth century Imperial Russia. In modern academia, the interdisciplinary study of the mutual impacts of science, technology, and society, is called science and technology studies.
The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale, such as the printing press, telephone, and Internet.
Technology has developed advanced economies, such as the modern  global economy, and has led to the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce by-products known as pollution, and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations influence the values of society and raise new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.
Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people. However, proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.

Pre-historical
The importance of stone tools, circa 2.5 million years ago, is considered fundamental in the human development in the hunting hypothesis.
Primatologist, Richard Wrangham, theorizes that the control of fire by early humans and the associated development of cooking was the spark that radically changed human evolution. Texts such as Guns, Germs, and Steel suggest that early advances in plant agriculture and husbandry fundamentally shifted the way that collective groups of individuals, and eventually societies, developed.

Modern examples and effects
Technology has taken a large role in society and day-to-day life. When societies know more about the development in a technology, they become able to take advantage of it. When an innovation achieves a certain point after it has been presented and promoted, this tech",technology
Client politics,"Clientelism or client politics is the exchange of goods and services for political support, often involving an implicit or explicit quid-pro-quo. It is closely related to patronage politics and vote buying.
Clientelism involves an asymmetric relationship between groups of political actors described as patrons, brokers, and clients. In client politics, an organized interest group benefits at the expense of the public. Client politics may have a strong interaction with the dynamics of identity politics. This is particularly common in an elite pluralist or rigidly duopolistic system, such as in the United States, where lobbying can have considerable power shaping public policy. The opposite of client politics is entrepreneurial politics, or conviction politics. Although many definitions for clientelism have been proposed, according to the political scientist Allen Hicken, it is generally thought that there are four key elements of clientelistic relationships:

Dyadic relationships: Simply, these are two-way relationships.
Contingency: Delivery of a service to a citizen by a politician or broker is contingent on the citizen's actions on behalf of the politician or party through which they are receiving services.
Hierarchy: The politician or party is in a higher position of power than the citizen.
Iteration: The relationship is not a one-off exchange, but rather, ongoing.
Contingency and iteration are the two components shared across most definitions of clientelism.

Origins
The origin of the practice has been traced to ancient Rome. Here relationships between the patron (patronus) and client (cliens) were seen as crucial to understanding the political process. While the obligations between these were mutual, the key point is they were hierarchical. These relationships might be best viewed not as an entity but rather as a network (clientela), with the patronus himself perhaps being obligated to someone of greater power, and the cliens perhaps having more than one patron. These extensions increase the possibilities of conflicting interests arising. While the familia was the basic unit underlying Roman society, the interlocking networks (clientela) acted as restrictions on their autonomy but allowed a more complex society to develop. Historians of the late medieval period evolved the concept into bastard feudalism. There is, as is usual, ambiguity in the use of political terminology and the terms ""clientelism"", the ""patron–client relationship"", ""patronage"", and the political machine are sometimes used to describe similar or related concepts.
The reigns of Julius Caesar (49–44 BCE) and Tiberius (14–16 AD) have been characterized as examples of widespread clientelism. In the 1500s, French political theorist Étienne de La Boétie did not use the term clientelism, but described the practice of emperors who used gifts to the public to gain loyalty from those who were eager to accept what amounted to bribery:

Ballot exhaustion,"In the alternative vote, ballot exhaustion occurs when a voter's ballot can no longer be counted, because all candidates on that ballot have been eliminated from an election.
Contributors to ballot exhaustion include:

Voter exhaustion (i.e. time or effort constraints),
Protest votes intended to oppose all unranked candidates,
Strategic truncation,
Jurisdictions that impose limits on how many preferences voters can express,
The elimination of popular candidates who have many 2nd, 3rd, etc. preferences in the early stages of a vote.
This may occur because the voter chooses not to fill out a complete preference ranking, or because the ballot format itself limits the number of preferences that may be expressed. This results in ""exhausted"" or ""inactive"" ballots. For example, in Minneapolis, the city limits voters to 3 rankings of candidates on ballots for city elections.

It provides protection against COVID-19, which is caused by infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is designed to be administered in two or three 0.5-mL doses given by intramuscular injection, primarily into the deltoid muscle, at an interval of at least 28 days apart. The World Health Organization advises an eight-week interval between doses to optimize efficacy. Additional booster doses are approved in some regions to maintain immunity. Clinical trials and real-world data have demonstrated the vaccine's high efficacy, with significant effectiveness observed two weeks post-administration of the second dose, offering 94% protection against Covid and robust defense against severe cases. The vaccine's efficacy spans various demographics, including age, sex, and those with high-risk medical conditions.
It is an mRNA vaccine composed of nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA) encoding a spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. In August and September 2022, bivalent versions of the vaccine (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent) containing elasomeran/elasomeran 0-omicron (Spikevax Bivalent Zero/Omicron) were authorized for use as booster doses in individuals aged 18 or older in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, the European Union, and the United States. The second component of the version of the bivalent vaccine used in the United States is based on the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant, while the second component of the bivalent vaccine version used in other countries is based on the Omicron BA.1 variant. The vaccine's effectiveness against variants has been extensively studied, indicating varying degrees of protection. For instance, during the prevalence of the Delta variant, effectiveness against infection slightly decreased over time. The vaccine's longevity and continuous protection are under study, with ongoing research focusing on its duration of effectiveness, which remains partially undetermined as of the latest updates.
The safety profile of the vaccine is favorable, with common side effects including injection site pain, fatigue, and headaches. Severe reactions like anaphylaxis are exceedingly rare. Concerns regarding myocarditis, have been identified but are typically mild and manageable. The vaccine's formulation utilizes mRNA technology, encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles to ensure cellular uptake and immune system response.

Fascist (insult),"Fascist has been used as a pejorative or insult against a wide range of people, political movements, governments, and institutions since the emergence of fascism in Europe in the 1920s. Political commentators on both the left and the right accused their opponents of being fascists, starting in the years before World War II. In 1928, the Communist International labeled their social democratic opponents as social fascists, while the social democrats themselves as well as some parties on the political right accused the Communists of having become fascist under Joseph Stalin's leadership. In light of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, The New York Times declared on 18 September 1939 that, ""Hitlerism is brown communism, Stalinism is red fascism."" Later, in 1944, the anti-fascist and socialist writer George Orwell commented on Tribune that fascism had been rendered almost meaningless by its common use as an insult against various people, and argued that in England the word fascist had become a synonym for bully.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was categorized by its former World War II allies as totalitarian alongside fascist Nazi Germany to convert pre-World War II anti-fascism into post-war anti-communism, and debates around the comparison of Nazism and Stalinism intensified. Both sides in the Cold War also used the insults fascist and fascism against the other. In the Soviet Union, they were used to describe anti-Soviet activism, and East Germany officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the ""Anti-Fascist Protection Wall"". Across the Eastern Bloc, the term anti-fascist became synonymous with the Communist state–party line and denoted the struggle against dissenters and the broader Western world. In the United States, early supporters of an aggressive foreign policy and domestic anti-communist measures in the 1940s and 1950s labeled the Soviet Union as fascist, and stated that it posed the same threat as the Axis Powers had posed during World War II. Accusations that the enemy was fascist were used to justify opposition to negotiations and compromise, with the argument that the enemy would always act in a manner similar to Adolf Hitler or Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

Eastern Europe
The Bolshevik movement and later the Soviet Union made frequent use of the fascist insult coming from its conflict with the early German and Italian fascist movements. The label was widely used in press and political language to describe the ideological opponents of the Bolsheviks, such as the White movement. Later, from 1928 to the mid-1930s, it was even applied to social democracy, which was called social fascism and even regarded by communist parties as the most dangerous form of fascism for a time. In Germany, the Communist Party of Germany, which had been largely controlled by the Soviet leadership since 1928, used the insult fascism to describe both the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). In Soviet usage, the German Nazis were described as fascis",politics
Incumbent,"The incumbent is the current holder of an office or position. In an election, the incumbent is the person holding or acting in the position that is up for election, regardless of whether they are seeking re-election.
There may or may not be an incumbent on the ballot: the previous holder may have died, retired, resigned; they may not seek re-election, be barred from re-election due to term limits, or a new electoral division or position may have been created, at which point the office or position is regarded as vacant or open. In the United States, an election without an incumbent on the ballot is an open seat or open contest.

Etymology
The word ""incumbent"" is derived from the Latin verb incumbere, literally meaning ""to lean or lay upon"" with the present participle stem incumbent-, ""leaning a variant of encumber, while encumber is derived from the root cumber, most appropriately defined: ""To occupy obstructively or inconveniently; to block fill up with what hinders freedom of motion or action; to burden, load.""

Incumbency advantage
In general, an incumbent has a political advantage over challengers at elections. Except when the timing of elections is determined by a constitution or by legislation, the incumbent in some countries may have the right to determine the date of an election.
For most political offices, the incumbent often has more name recognition due to their previous work in the office. Incumbents also have easier access to campaign finance, as well as government resources (such as the franking privilege) that can be indirectly used to boost the incumbent's re-election campaign.
In the United States, an election (especially for a single-member constituency in a legislature) in which an incumbent is not seeking re-election is often called an open seat; because of the lack of incumbency advantage, these are often amongst the most hotly contested races in any election. Also, an open contest is created when the term of office is limited, as in the case of terms of the U.S. president being restricted to two four-year terms, and the incumbent is prohibited from recontesting. Although the expected advantage of incumbency has gone from about two percentage points in the 1950s, to ten percentage points in the 1980s and 1990s, and then back to about two percentage points in the 2010s and 2020s, the probability that an incumbent will lose his or her seat has remained approximately the same over the entire period.
When newcomers look to fill an open office, voters tend to compare and contrast the candidates' qualifications, positions on political issues, and personal characteristics in a relatively straightforward way. Elections featuring an incumbent, on the other hand, are, as Guy Molyneux puts it, ""fundamentally a referendum on the incumbent."" Voters will first grapple with the record of the incumbent. Only if they decide to ""fire"" the incumbent do they begin to evaluate whether each of the challengers is an acceptable alternative.

List of digital television deployments by country,"This is a list of digital television deployments by country, which summarises the process and progress of transition from analogue to digital broadcasting.
The transition to digital television is a process that is happening at different paces around the world. Although digital satellite television is now commonplace, the switch to digital cable and terrestrial television has taken longer. See also Digital terrestrial television.
The major terrestrial broadcast standards are DVB-T (Europe), ATSC (North America), DTMB (China), and ISDB (two incompatible variations used in Japan and South America).
Not all deployments for a given standard are compatible. Countries that have adopted digital terrestrial recently may have a single MPEG4 based system for SD and HD, while countries with more established system may use MPEG2 for SD and MPEG4 for HD. There are also variations in middleware used. For example, Italy, Ireland and the UK are all DVB-T regions, but Ireland uses ""MPEG4 + MHEG5 + DVB-T"" for both SD and HD transmissions, while the UK uses ""MPEG2 + MHEG5 + DVB-T"" for SD and ""MPEG4 + MHEG5 + DVB-T2"" for HDTV, and Italy uses MHP rather than MHEG5 middleware. Since all MPEG4-capable receivers can decode the MPEG2 codec and all DVB-T2 tuners are capable of tuning DVB-T signals, UK HD set-top boxes are compatible with both the UK SD system and Irish SD/HD system, but Irish SD/HD tuners will only work with the SD system used in the UK. Digital cable broadcast tends to be DVB-C or very similar QAM in almost all countries. Broadband on cable is mostly DOCSIS which is DVB-C on the download path. This is important when buying a TV or set-box online rather than from a local retailer who would normally only stock the compatible system. Incompatible retail products are a severe problem in emerging retail digital markets where a neighbouring country has an older standard and dominates the retail trade, such as UK Freeview (rather than compatible ""Freeview HD"") products in Ireland.
Important DVB-T standards are UK D-book for UK Freeview and Nordig 2.2 for Scandinavia and Ireland. Ireland deviates from Nordig by using UK profile MHEG5 middleware rather than MHP.

Africa
Botswana
Botswana became the first country in Africa to adopt ISDB-T International on February 26, 2013, evaluated the hierarchical mode of operation, which allows for the simultaneous transmission to fixed, mobile and portable receivers from a single transmitter, advantageous over DVB-T2.

Mozambique
The earliest form of digital television in Mozambique began in 1996 with Southern African pay-TV operator DStv. Channels were transmitted and received via satellites and digital decoders. Some years later, TVCabo, began transmitting at first through analog and later digital means using decoders and an extensive fiber optic network. On January 18, Mozambique's Ministry of Transport and Communications announced that the country would be adopting the DVB-T2 system for transmission of terrestrial televisi",technology
Anti-asthmatic agent,"An anti-asthmatic agent, also known as an anti-asthma drug, refers to a drug that can aid in airway smooth muscle dilation to allow normal breathing during an asthma attack or reduce inflammation on the airway to decrease airway resistance for asthmatic patients, or both. The goal of asthmatic agents is to reduce asthma exacerbation frequencies and related hospital visits.
Anti-asthmatic agents as rescue medications for acute asthma attacks include short-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (SABA), short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA), systemic glucocorticoids, and magnesium sulfate. Anti-asthmatic agents as maintenance medications for asthmatic symptom control include long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (LABA), inhaled glucocorticoids, long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), methylxanthines/phosphodiesterase inhibitors, leukotriene receptor antagonists, mast cell stabilizers, and certain types of monoclonal antibodies.
Global Initiative of Asthma (GINA) is the official guideline on the usage of anti-asthmatic agents. The GINA guideline outlines the class, dosage, and administration of anti-asthmatic agents prescription depending on the severity of asthma symptoms and nature.

Rescue medications
Inhaled short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists
Inhaled short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, such as terbutaline and salbutamol, are the first-line drugs indicated for asthma exacerbation for all patients to provide rapid bronchodilating effects. Short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists can be delivered by different devices, for example, nebulizers and metered-dose inhalers.
β2-adrenergic agonists can trigger the activation of Gs protein-coupled β2-adrenergic receptors on the airway smooth muscle cells in the lungs. The β2-adrenergic receptors activation allows the adenylyl cyclase within the airway smooth muscle cells to catalyse the conversion of ATP to cAMP. cAMP as a second messenger further activates protein kinase A and decreases the intracellular calcium level, causing subsequent smooth muscle relaxation.
Common side effects of inhaled β2-adrenergic agonists include tremors, palpitations and headache. The incidence and severity of side effects depend on the dose and route of administration of the β2-adrenergic agonists.

Inhaled short-acting muscarinic antagonists
Inhaled short-acting muscarinic antagonists, such as oxitropium and ipratropium, can be used as an adjunct therapy with short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists in moderate to severe asthma exacerbations to achieve bronchodilation. Short-acting muscarinic antagonists are usually discontinued upon hospital admission due to a lack of benefits among hospitalized patients. 
Muscarinic antagonists can compete with acetylcholine for muscarinic receptors and provide an antagonistic effect on muscarinic receptors, causing inhibition of cholinergic bronchomotor tone and hence bronchodilation.
Inhaled muscarinic antagonists commonly cause dry mouth, throat irritation and dizziness.

Hate speech,"Hate speech is a term with varied meaning and has no single, consistent definition. It is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as ""public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation"". The Encyclopedia of the American Constitution states that hate speech is ""usually thought to include communications of animosity or disparagement of an individual or a group on account of a group characteristic such as race, color, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or sexual orientation"". There is no single definition of what constitutes ""hate"" or ""disparagement"". Legal definitions of hate speech vary from country to country.
There has been much debate over freedom of speech, hate  speech, and hate speech legislation. The laws of some countries describe hate speech as speech, gestures, conduct, writing, or displays that incite violence or prejudicial actions against a group or individuals on the basis of their membership in the group, or that disparage or intimidate a group or individuals on the basis of their membership in the group. The law may identify protected groups based on certain characteristics. In some countries, including the United States, what is usually labelled ""hate speech"" is constitutionally protected. In some other countries, a victim of hate speech may seek redress under civil law, criminal law, or both.
Hate speech is generally accepted to be one of the prerequisites for mass atrocities such as genocide. Incitement to genocide is an extreme form of hate speech, and has been prosecuted in international courts such as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

History
Starting in the 1940s and 50s, various American civil rights groups responded to the atrocities of World War II by advocating for restrictions on hateful speech targeting groups on the basis of race and religion. These organizations used group libel as a legal framework for describing the violence of hate speech and addressing its harm. In his discussion of the history of criminal libel, scholar Jeremy Waldron states that these laws helped ""vindicate public order, not just by preempting violence, but by upholding against attack a shared sense of the basic elements of each person's status, dignity, and reputation as a citizen or member of society in good standing"". A key legal victory for this view came in 1952 when group libel law was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in Beauharnais v. Illinois. However, the group libel approach lost ground due to a rise in support for individual rights within civil rights movements during the 60s. Critiques of group defamation laws are not limited to defenders of individual rights. Some legal theorists, such as critical race theorist Richard Delgado, support legal limits on hate speech, but claim that defamation is too narrow a category to fully counter hate speech. Ultimately, Delgado advocates a legal strategy that would ",politics
Sports economics,"Sports economics is a discipline of economics focused on its relationship to sports. It covers both the ways in which economists can study the distinctive institutions of sports, and the ways in which sports can allow economists to research many topics, including discrimination and antitrust law. The theoretical foundations of the discipline are heavily based on microeconomics. As of 2006, about 100 to 120 college professors taught sports economics courses. As of 2024 there are a number of important locations where sports economics is taught and researched by a group of faculty. This includes Bielefeld, Cork, Liverpool, Reading and Zurich in Europe, as well as Michigan and West Virginia in the United States. The community normally meets annually with prestigious events including the North American Association of Sports Economists (NAASE) Conference and the European Sport Economics Association (ESEA) Conference.

The beginning of sports economics
Simon Rottenberg is credited with likely being the first to pen a scholarly article in the field of sports economics when he wrote his 1956 article on the Uncertainty of Outcome Hypothesis. In this article, Rottenberg highlights the relationship of attendance at baseball games with things such as price, alternate activities, how good the team is, how large of a market the team is in, and so on. Importantly, Rottenberg made mention of “dispersion of games won by team in the league.”

Key components
Competitive balance is one of the most important ideas within sports economics. This idea, in general, refers to the comparison of wins between all teams in a league. Rottenberg effectively built this seminal idea with his interest in ""dispersion of games won."" Related to competitive balance is the understanding of different leagues and different team within those leagues objectives. Understanding the ownership structure and motives of front office personnel through their financial, read economic, decisions will reveal whether a team is looking to only generate profit, attempt to win a championship, or something entirely different. Making sense of human behavior through data is the central idea of economics and certainly applies to Sports Economics as well. Sports leagues look to promote competitive balance to make more games appealing to fans to watch, both in person and on TV. Many European leagues achieve competitive balance through promotion and relegation systems where multiple leagues are intertwined with teams moving between leagues based upon performance.  Most sports leagues in the United States are standalone league and work towards competitive balance through other measures. These can include salary caps and roster size limits.

Importance
Sometimes sports economics is dismissed as a side hobby for number crunchers. However, the proliferation of globalized sports markets as well as the extreme rise in sports media demonstrates its importance. In the United States, the Super Bowl regularly commands the",economics
Iron Age,"The Iron Age (c. 1200 – c. 550 BC) is the final epoch of the three historical Metal Ages, after the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age. It has also been considered as the final age of the three-age division starting with prehistory (before recorded history) and progressing to protohistory (before written history). In this usage, it is preceded by the Stone Age (subdivided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic) and Bronze Age. These concepts originated for describing Iron Age Europe and the ancient Near East. In the archaeology of the Americas, a five-period system is conventionally used instead; indigenous cultures there did not develop an iron economy in the pre-Columbian era, though some did work copper and bronze. Indigenous metalworking arrived in Australia with European contact.
Although meteoric iron has been used for millennia in many regions, the beginning of the Iron Age is defined locally around the world by archaeological convention when the production of smelted iron (especially steel tools and weapons) replaces their bronze equivalents in common use.
In Anatolia and the Caucasus, or Southeast Europe, the Iron Age began during the late 2nd millennium BC (c. 1300 BC). In the ancient Near East, this transition occurred simultaneously with the Late Bronze Age collapse, during the 12th century BC (1200–1100 BC). The technology soon spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin region and to South Asia between the 12th and 11th century BC. Its further spread to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central Europe was somewhat delayed, and Northern Europe was not reached until about the start of the 5th century BC (500 BC).
The Iron Age in India is stated as beginning with the ironworking Painted Grey Ware culture, dating from the c. 1200 BC, through to the reign of Ashoka in the 3rd century BC. The term ""Iron Age"" in the archaeology of South, East, and Southeast Asia is more recent and less common than for Western Eurasia. Africa did not have a universal ""Bronze Age"", and many areas transitioned directly from stone to iron. Some archaeologists believe that iron metallurgy was developed in sub-Saharan Africa independently from Eurasia and neighbouring parts of Northeast Africa as early as 2000 BC.
The concept of the Iron Age ending with the beginning of the written historiographical record has not generalized well, as written language and steel use have developed at different times in different areas across the archaeological record. For instance, in China, written history started before iron smelting began, so the term is used infrequently for the archaeology of China. In Mesopotamia, written history predates iron smelting  by hundreds of years. For the ancient Near East, the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire c. 550 BC is used traditionally and still usually as an end date; later dates are considered historical according to the record by Herodotus despite considerable written records now being known from well back into the Bronze Age.

Campdrafting,"Campdrafting is a unique Australian sport involving a horse and rider working cattle. The riding style is Australian stock, somewhat akin to American Western riding and the event is similar to the American stock horse events such as cutting, working cow horse, team penning, and ranch sorting.
In a campdrafting competition, a rider on horseback must ""cut out"" one beast from the mob of cattle in the yard or the ""camp"" and block and turn the beast at least two or three times to prove to the judge that they have the beast under control; then take it out of the yard and through a course around pegs involving right and left hand turns in a figure eight, before guiding it through two pegs known as ""the gate"". The outside course must be completed in less than 40 seconds. Events for juniors 8 years and under 13 years have one sound beast in the camp or yard at all times. In other events it is recommended that there shall be a minimum of six head of sound stock in the camp at any time.
Up to a total of 100 points are scored by horse and rider: ""Cut out"" is worth a total of 26 points; horse work up to a further 70 points; and 4 points for the course. Most disqualifications (signalled by a crack of the judge's stockwhip) occur when a competitor loses his beast more than twice on the camp; losing control of the beast in the arena or running a beast onto the arena fence. A ""tail turn"" executed by a horse in the opposite direction of the beast's line of travel also incurs disqualification at any stage of the draft.
The sport requires consummate skill and horsemanship, and the skill in selecting a beast from the mob that will run well, but is not too fast for that particular horse. Great prestige is bestowed on the winning horse and rider of the competition.

History
It is thought the sport developed in outback Queensland among the stockmen and drovers in informal competitions to prove horse skills. The first formal campdrafting competition occurred in Tenterfield at the Tenterfield Show Society's 1885 show. Competing at this event was Clarence Smith, a cattleman and horse breeder near Tenterfield, on the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales. He went on to create the rules and judging procedures that remain similar to the rules of today.
The Warwick Gold Cup is one of the premier events on Australia's campdraft calendar where around 1,800 camp drafters compete for prize money over about four days of competition. Paradise Lagoons in Queensland is the venue of the richest campdraft in Australia  with A$230,000 of prize money distributed over the four days of competition.

Touch (sport),"Touch (also known as touch football or touch rugby) is a variant of rugby league that is conducted under the direction of the Federation of International Touch (FIT). Though it shares similarities and history with rugby league, it is recognised as a sport in its own right due to its differences which have been developed over the sport's lifetime.
Touch is a variation of rugby league with the tackling of opposing players replaced by a touch. As touches must be made with minimal force, touch is therefore considered a limited-contact sport. The original basic rules of touch were established in the 1960s by members of the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club in Sydney, Australia.
Distinctive features of touch include the ease of learning it, minimal equipment requirements, ability to play it without fear of major injury, and the regularity of males and females playing together, and as such it is often played either as alternative to or as a soft introduction to full-blown rugby football.  While it is generally played with two teams of six on-field players, some social competitions allow a different number of players per team on the field. It is played by both sexes, and in age divisions from primary school children to over-60s. The mixed version of the sport (where both male and female players are on the field at the same time) is particularly popular with social players but is also played at an International representative level.

History
Origins
While it is often claimed that Touch started in Australia in 1963 as a social or ""park"" game and as a training technique for rugby league, at least as early as 1956, supervised ""touch and pass"" was already being played at several inner city schools in the North of England, where asphalt playgrounds made normal rugby league too dangerous. Although the rules were set out by the schools' sports teachers, it was not then viewed as a sport in its own right.
Touch was formalised into a sport proper by the ""Founders of Touch"", Bob Dyke and Ray Vawdon of the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club. On 13 July 1968 an organisation known as the South Sydney Touch Football Club was formed and the sport of Touch Football was officially born. The first official Touch match was played in late 1968 and the first official competition, organised by Dyke & Vawdon, was held at Rowland Park Sydney in 1968.
From its formal inception in 1968, the game quickly became a fully regulated and codified sport in Australia. Originally played under lightly modified rugby league laws to remove hard physical contact, the sport has since evolved under its own specific rules now quite varied from its rugby league roots. The reduction of field size to half that of a rugby league field in particular aided the sports rapid growth across Australian rugby league stronghold areas as it allowed greater participating in the same geographic footprint.
The sport was first played in Brisbane, Australia in 1972 and by 1973 there were representative match",sports
Sheep shearing,"Sheep shearing is the process by which the woollen fleece of a sheep is cut off. The person who removes the sheep's wool is called a shearer. Typically each adult sheep is shorn once each year (depending upon dialect, a sheep may be said to have been ""shorn"", ""sheared"" or ""shore"" [in Australia]). The annual shearing most often occurs in a shearing shed, a facility especially designed to process often hundreds and sometimes more than 3,000 sheep per day. A working group of shearers and accompanying wool workers is known as a shearing gang.
Sheep are shorn in all seasons including winter, depending on the climate, management requirements and the availability of a woolclasser and shearers. Ewes are normally shorn prior to lambing in the warmer months, but consideration is typically made as to the welfare of the lambs by not shearing during cold climate winters. However, in high country regions, pre lamb shearing encourages ewes to seek shelter among the hillsides so that newborn lambs are not completely exposed to the elements. Shorn sheep tolerate frosts well, but young sheep especially will suffer in cold, wet windy weather (even in cold climate summers). In this event they are shedded for several nights until the weather clears. Some sheep may also be shorn with stud combs commonly known as cover combs which leave more wool on the animal in colder months, giving greater protection.
Sheep shearing is also considered a sport with competitions held around the world. It is often done between spring and summer.

History
Pre-Industrial Europe
Europe's oldest city, Knossos, derived its wealth from the sheep wool industry. The largest group of Linear B tablets is the great archive principally of shearing records though also of sheep breeding.
The medieval English wool trade was one of the most important factors in the English economy. The main sheep-shearing was an annual midsummer (June) event in medieval England culminating in the sheep-shearing feast. It had always been conventional practice to wash sheep.

Australia
In Australia, until the 1870s, squatters washed their sheep in nearby creeks prior to shearing. Later some expensive hot water installations were constructed on some of the larger stations for the washing. Australian growers were influenced by the Spanish practice of washing their very fine wool after shearing. There were three main reasons for the custom in Australia:

The English manufacturers demanded that Australian woolgrowers provide their fleeces free from excessive vegetable matter, burrs, soil, etc. so they could be processed in the same way as any other raw wool
The dirty fleeces were hard to shear and demanded that the metal blade shears be sharpened more often.
Wool in Australia was carted by bullock team or horse teams and charged by weight. Washed wool was lighter and did not cost as much to transport.
The practice of washing the wool rather than the sheep evolved from the fact that hotter water could be used to wash the woo",sports
Canne de combat,"Canne de combat is a French combat sport. As weapon, it uses a canne or cane (a kind of walking-stick) designed for fighting. Canne de combat was standardized in the 1970s for sporting competition by Maurice Sarry. The canne is very light, made of chestnut wood and slightly tapered. A padded suit and a fencing mask are worn for protection.

History
The canne de combat or canne d'arme  originated in France in the early 19th century as a self-defence discipline and was particularly used by the upper classes in large, unsafe cities such as Paris. Some classify it as a French martial art although its codification as a sport does not allow this name officially. The history of the discipline is closely linked to the development of the savate boxing techniques, which in earlier forms largely used kicks and later, under the influence of the British, incorporated punches. Gentlemen trained into the savate techniques mastered cane as a way of fighting from a distance as well as close combat kickboxing. The cane was more common in cities, whereas a staff akin to a European quarterstaff was more popular in rural areas. The tactics used were largely interchangeable between these disciplines.
The techniques of savate and canne d'arme increased in popularity up to the point that they were used by military and police forces until World War I. The deaths of many of its practitioners during the war caused the discipline to decline substantially. Its techniques continued, however, to be taught in a few savate boxing clubs that remained after the First World War and managed to survive World War II.  There is reputed to be a group who operated during the Nazi occupation who used cane techniques to carry out assassinations. Cane fighting techniques of the late 1950s and 1960s were influenced by revival efforts of enthusiasts.

Self-defence sport
During the late 1970s, the techniques of the canne d'arme were codified by Maurice Sarry with a view to rehabilitating it as a sport. This led to the discipline which is still today associated with the Federation de Savate Boxe Française (""French Savate Boxing Federation""). Aside from the sport approach, self-defense techniques are still alive; e.g., the ""Master Lafond"" technique.
Today, the sport canne de combat is practiced by a thousand cannistes, and the French staff by some hundreds of bâtonniers or bâtonnistes.

Canne de combat in the USA
In the USA Jean-Noel Eynard brought canne de combat to the east coast in combination with Savate. The first real FFBFSDA/ FIS club of Canne de combat/ Savate was open in 1983 on the east coast in Philadelphia, under Dr. Jean-Noel Eynard, FFBFSDA/ FIS Professeur with the assistance of former FFBFSDA/ FIS DTN Bob Alix. Canne de combat was also taught in 1994 in Memphis, Tennessee.

Use
The use of the cane as a weapon, as originally taught in weapons schools, was codified by the masters of savate so that the cane was taught as a weapon of self-defence. The French tradition includes techniq",sports

Occupational science,"Occupational science is a discipline dedicated to the study of humans as ""doers"" or ""occupational beings"". As used here, the term ""occupation"" refers to the intentional or goal-directed activities that characterize daily human life as well as the characteristics and patterns of purposeful activity that occur over lifetimes.

History
Occupational science evolved as a loosely organized effort by many scholars in different disciplines to understand human time use. It was named and given additional impetus in 1989 by a team of faculty at the University of Southern California (USC) led by Dr. Elizabeth Yerxa, who had been influenced by the work of graduate students under the supervision of Mary Reilly at the same university.  Since its formal beginning at that time, which coincided with the establishment of a Ph.D. program in Occupational Science at USC; occupational science has evolved as an additional source of research to expand empirical knowledge underlying the profession of occupational therapy.

Links between occupational science and occupational therapy
Occupational science was developed by scholars (mainly from the profession of occupational therapy) who drew from original ideas predating the founding of occupational therapy. It may thus be considered as a developing or emerging academic discipline. The substrates (or underlying dimensions) of occupation (form, function, and meaning) are difficult to observe and quantify, and thus require and benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. While both occupational science and occupational therapy are rooted in systems theory and holistic views of human agency, the methods for observing and understanding an occupation's form (how something is done), function (its purpose), and meaning (how it is understood and experienced by the doer) are not always holistic in approach. For instance, disciplines such as biomechanics and psychology inform occupational science but, individually, are not necessarily concerned about how their explanations contribute to an integrated understanding of the factors collectively influencing a person's daily life. Professional practice in occupational therapy can prompt new ideas and spark potential research within the discipline of occupational science; although typically, knowledge from academic disciplines precedes the application of such knowledge in applied fields.  Occupational science has the capacity to provide insight into the primary modality of occupational therapy (occupation) through studying the consequences of participation in occupation and its therapeutic benefits.  Reciprocally, occupational therapy research may provide insights into how human agency and the factors influencing it change under conditions of illness, disability or therapeutic intervention. Additional viewpoints about these relationships may be found in documents describing relationships between occupational science and occupational therapy that have been published by the World Federation of ",science
Perception limit,"Human perception is limited by the biological capabilities of the senses. The human eye can detect only a narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and human hearing is restricted to specific sound frequencies. Similarly, touch, taste, and smell provide only partial information about the environment. Scientific advancements have revealed that much of reality exists beyond these perceptual boundaries, including infrared and ultraviolet light, infrasound and ultrasound frequencies, and forms of matter and energy that are not directly detectable by human senses.
Various animals perceive the world differently, with some species detecting electromagnetic fields, sensing vibrations, or seeing ultraviolet patterns. Additionally, technologies such as telescopes, microscopes, and artificial intelligence have expanded human understanding of phenomena beyond sensory perception. Research in physics, neuroscience, and cognitive science continues to explore the extent of these limitations and their implications for understanding reality.

Introduction
Human perception is the process by which individuals interpret sensory information to understand their environment. It is shaped by past experiences, contextual factors, and cognitive goals, which can introduce biases in perception. Additionally, perception is constrained by attentional capacity and can be influenced by emotional states. Studying human perception is essential for designing applications and interfaces that align with natural cognitive processes, enhancing usability and interaction with technology.
Research suggests that the human brain can retain approximately seven units of meaningful information at a time, with a typical range of five to nine. This limitation, often associated with working memory, affects how people process and recall new information. For instance, when presented with a sequence of 20 random numbers, most individuals can accurately remember only a subset—usually between five and nine of the most recent ones.
This concept has significant implications for learning and information retention. While most learning experiences do not involve memorizing random numbers, the principle highlights the importance of structuring content effectively. When introducing new material, limiting the number of key ideas to around seven can help learners better absorb and retain information, preventing cognitive overload and enhancing comprehension.
Human memory has a limited capacity, often constrained to holding 5 to 9 pieces of information at a time. However, cognitive research suggests that organizing information into meaningful clusters—known as ""chunking""—can significantly enhance retention and recall. By grouping smaller pieces of information into larger, more structured units, individuals can process and remember greater amounts of data without exceeding cognitive limitations.
This principle applies across various learning and communication strategies. For instance, acronyms serve as effec",technology
Migration Period,"The Migration Period (c. 300 to 600 AD), also known as the Barbarian Invasions, was a period in European history marked by large-scale migrations that saw the fall of the Western Roman Empire and subsequent settlement of its former territories by various tribes, and the establishment of the post-Roman kingdoms. 
The term refers to the important role played by the migration, invasion, and settlement of various tribes, notably the Burgundians, Vandals, Goths, Alemanni, Alans, Huns, early Slavs, Pannonian Avars, Bulgars and Magyars within or into the territories of the Roman Empire and Europe as a whole. The period is traditionally taken to have begun in AD 375 (possibly as early as 300) and ended in 568. Various factors contributed to this phenomenon of migration and invasion, and their role and significance are still widely discussed.
Historians differ as to the dates for the beginning and ending of the Migration Period. The beginning of the period is widely regarded as the invasion of Europe by the Huns from Asia in about 375 and the ending with the conquest of Italy by the Lombards in 568, but a more loosely set period is from as early as 300 to as late as 800. For example, in the 4th century a very large group of Goths was settled as foederati within the Roman Balkans, and the Franks were settled south of the Rhine in Roman Gaul. In 406 a particularly large and unexpected crossing of the Rhine was made by a group of Vandals, Alans and Suebi. As central power broke down in the Western Roman Empire, the military became more important but was dominated by men of barbarian origin.
There are contradictory opinions as to whether the fall of the Western Roman Empire was a result of an increase in migrations, or if both the breakdown of central power and the increased importance of non-Romans created additional internal factors. Migrations, and the use of non-Romans in the military, were known in the periods before and after, and the Eastern Roman Empire adapted and continued to exist until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453. The fall of the Western Roman Empire, although it involved the establishment of competing barbarian kingdoms, was to some extent managed by the Eastern emperors. 
The migrants comprised war bands or tribes of 10,000 to 20,000 people. Immigration was common throughout the time of the Roman Empire, but over the course of 100 years, the migrants numbered not more than 750,000 in total, compared to an average 40 million population of the Roman Empire at that time. The first migrations of peoples were made by Germanic tribes such as the Goths (including the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths), the Vandals, the Anglo-Saxons, the Lombards, the Suebi, the Frisii, the Jutes, the Burgundians, the Alemanni, the Sciri and the Franks; they were later pushed westward by the Huns, the Avars, the Slavs and the Bulgars. Later invasions, such as the Vikings, the Normans, the Varangians, the Hungarians, the Arabs, the Turks, and the Mongol",history
Big wall climbing,"Big wall climbing is a form of rock climbing that takes place on long and sheer multi-pitch routes (of at least 6–10 pitches or 300–500 metres) that require a full day, if not several days, to ascend.  Big wall routes are sustained and exposed and the climbers remain suspended from the continuously sheer and vertical rock face, even sleeping hanging from the face, with limited options to sit down or escape unless they abseil down the route—a complex and risky action. It is therefore a physically and mentally demanding form of climbing.
Big wall climbing is typically done in pairs in a traditional climbing format, but with the distinction that the non-lead climber usually ascends by jumaring up a fixed rope to save time and energy.  It requires an extensive range of supplies and equipment over and above that of traditional climbing that is carried in haul bags, including portaledges, aid climbing equipment, poop tubes, and food and water.  It requires additional techniques such as pendulums/tension traversing, aid climbing, using trail ropes, jumaring, and sometimes simul climbing.
Big wall climbing began in the Dolomites with early pioneers such as Emilio Comici inventing many of the first techniques and tools in the 1930s, and then spreading throughout the entire European Alps by climbers such as Riccardo Cassin and Walter Bonatti with his milestone solo ascent of the Dru in 1955.  From the 1960s, American climbers led by Royal Robbins developed Yosemite into the most important big wall climbing venue in the world, with Lynn Hill's 1993 first free ascent of The Nose at 5.14a (8b+) on El Capitan being an important milestone in big wall history.  Major high-altitude big-walls have been scaled in Patagonia and in the Himalayas.

Description
Big wall climbing is rock climbing on large routes that often take a full day, if not several days, of continuous climbing to ascend.  Big wall climbing is a form of multi-pitch climbing but there is no definition of how many pitches are needed for a route to be a big wall; a minimum of at least 6–10 pitches (or roughly 300–500 metres) is typically required. Big wall climbing is usually done in pairs as lead climbing, however, due to the length of the climbs, the second climber usually ascends via a fixed rope to save energy and time.
Big wall climbing can be performed as free climbing, however, it is common for big wall climbers to use some level of aid climbing on the route, as it is often impossible for very large multi-pitch routes to have a uniform level of difficulty (i.e. there may be some sections that are well beyond the difficulties of the rest of the route).  Most big wall routes require traditional climbing techniques for climbing protection however some routes have bolted sections (or pitons) like sport climbing routes.  Big wall routes have also been free solo climbed.
Big wall climbing routes are typically sustained and exposed, where the climbers are suspended from the rock wall during their enti",sports
Latifundio–minifundio land tenure structure,"The land tenure of Latin America is called the 'Latifundio–minifundio' structure. This dualistic tenure system is characterized by relatively few large commercial estates known as latifundios, which are over 500 hectares and numerous small properties known as minifundios, which are under 5 hectares. Minifundios are mainly subsistence-oriented smallholdings and are generally farmed by peasant households. Latifundios relied mainly on peonage, which is a form of unfree labour or wage labor in which a laborer (peon) has little control over employment conditions, with features of feudal serfdom.

AKTIP (therapeutic institute),"AKTIP – Konzultační a terapeutický institut Praha (lit. 'Consultation and Therapeutic Institute Prague') was a private institute in Prague run by the public business company Progressive consulting, offering services in the field of psychosomatic care. The head of the institute was Czech psychiatrist Jarmila Klímová.
Controversy about the methods of the institute emerged when the documentary Infiltrace: Obchod se zdravím (Infiltration: Health Business) was broadcast by Czech television on May 21, 2018.
The documentary revealed that the company uses unethical techniques to the detriment of its patients for its financial gain, including pseudoscience, manipulation, and incitement of fear of cancer and anxiety. AKTIP offers examinations and healing by instrumentation and homeopathic preparations of doubtful effectiveness for various somatic diseases, including thyroid disease.
Although it has physicians on staff, this institution is not a legitimate provider of health services. It is not a medical facility.

If it fails, a miraculous ANESA device, known as the non-invasive AMP blood analyzer (Golden Erratic Boulder award for 2011), will come to the scene"", said Sisyfos.
In the awards report its representatives also cite the statement of the head of AKTIP Jarmila Klímová that the human body is set for 400 years of life. ""If we really lived only by biological hours, we could be at rest between 380 and 460 years, because this age is set up for our body ... And why do we live only 60 or 80 years? No, because the most important influence outside of ourselves, which fundamentally affects the length and quality of life, we do not accept.""

Professional public response
The practices of AKTIP was already criticized by the Czech Oncological Society in 2014.
Procedures used by AKTIP employees have been critically evaluated by doctors (f.ex. by cardiologist Věra Adámková) The psychologist Petr Weiss described AKTIP's practices as charlatan fabrications, fraud, and money-pulling activities.
According to the President of the Czech Medical Chamber Milan Kubka, AKTIP's position in the future could be solved by a law on healers that would force ""all such charlatan institutions"" to mandatory registration. ""This institution only looks like a medical facility, and that's a scam from my point of view.""

Fat cat,"Fat cat is a political term originally describing a rich political donor, also called an angel or big-money man.
The New York Times has described fat cats as symbols of ""a deeply corrupt campaign finance system riddled with loopholes"", with Americans seeing them as recipients of the ""perks of power"", but able to ""buy access, influence policy and even veto appointments"".
It is also commonly used to describe a rich, powerful and greedy person who, due to ownership of large amounts of capital, is able to ""live easy"" off the work of others. In the United Kingdom, it is also used to refer to executives whose pay is deemed by others to be excessive.

History
The word was first used in the 1920s in the United States to describe rich political donors.
The term's coinage for political purposes has been attributed to Frank Kent, a writer for The Baltimore Sun whose essay ""Fat Cats and Free Rides"" appeared in the American Mercury, a magazine of commentary run by H. L. Mencken. Kent wrote:

A Fat Cat is a man of large means and slight political experience who, having reached middle age, and success in business, and finding no further thrill, sense or satisfaction in the mere piling up of more millions, develops a yearning for some sort of public honor, and is willing to pay for it. There are such men in all the States, and they are as welcome to the organization [i.e., the party] as the flowers in May. They relieve the pressure all along the line, lighten the load, make life brighter and better for the busy machine workers. The [political] machine has what the Fat Cat wants [i.e., public honor], and the Fat Cat has what the machine must have, to wit, money
The 1960 campaign for the Democratic nomination to the presidency was marked by competition between fellow Senators Hubert Humphrey and John F. Kennedy. Their first meeting was in the Wisconsin primary, where Kennedy's well-organized and well-funded campaign defeated Humphrey's energetic but poorly funded effort. Humphrey objected to the media, ""The Kennedy forces are waging a psychological blitz that I cannot match. I'm not the candidate of the fat cats.""
A 1972 book by sociologist G. William Domhoff, titled Fat Cats and Democrats, contrasted the Democratic Party's perceived populism with its funding structure. In Domhoff's view, ""Short of a nationwide system of public financing for candidates ... it seems likely that wealthy fat cats will find one way or another to finance the candidates of their choice.""
The campaign finance reforms following the Watergate scandal greatly reduced the amount of money that individuals could contribute to a political campaign. In the words of Ben J. Wattenberg, ""The fat cats were driven from the temple"".

Agribusiness,"Agribusiness is the industry, enterprises, and the field of study of value chains in agriculture and in the bio-economy,
in which case it is also called bio-business or bio-enterprise. 
The primary goal of agribusiness is to maximize profit while satisfying the needs of consumers for products related to natural resources. Agribusinesses comprise farms, food and fiber processing, forestry, fisheries, biotechnology and biofuel enterprises and their input suppliers.
Studies of business growth and performance in farming have found that successful agricultural businesses are cost-efficient internally and operate in favourable economic, political, and physical-organic environments. They are able to expand and make profits, improve the productivity of land, labor, and capital, and keep their costs down to ensure market price competitiveness.
Agribusiness is not limited to farming. It encompasses a broader spectrum through the agribusiness system which includes input supplies, value-addition, marketing, entrepreneurship, microfinancing, and agricultural extension.
In some countries like the Philippines, creation and management of agribusiness enterprises require consultation with registered agriculturists above a certain level of operations, capitalization, land area, or number of animals in the farm.

Evolution of the agribusiness concept
The word ""agribusiness"" is a portmanteau of the words agriculture and business. The earliest known use of the word was in the Volume 155 of the Canadian Almanac & Directory published in 1847. Although most practitioners recognize that it was coined in 1957 by two Harvard Business School professors, John Davis and Ray Goldberg after they published the book ""A Concept of Agribusiness.""

""Agribusiness is the sum total of all operations involved in the manufacture and distribution of farm supplies; production operations on the farm; and the storage, processing, and distribution of farm commodities and items made from them."" (Davis and Goldberg, 1956)
Their book argued against the New Deal programs of then U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt as it led to the increase in agricultural prices. Davis and Goldberg favored corporate-driven agriculture or large-scale farming to revolutionize the agriculture sector, lessening the dependency on state power and politics. They explained in the book that vertically integrated firms within the agricultural value chains have the ability to control prices and where they are distributed. Goldberg then assisted in the establishment of the first undergraduate program in agribusiness in 1966 at the UP College of Agriculture in Los Baños, Philippines as Bachelor of Science in Agriculture major in Agribusiness. The program was initially a joint undertaking with the UP College of Business Administration in Diliman, Quezon City until 1975. Jose D. Drilon of the University of the Philippines then published the book ""Agribusiness Management Resource Materials"" (1971) which would be the foundation of ",economics
Identity politics,"Identity politics is politics based on a particular identity, such as ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, denomination, gender, sexual orientation, social background, caste, age, disability, intelligence, and social class. The term encompasses various often-populist political phenomena and rhetoric, such as governmental migration policies that regulate mobility and opportunity based on identities, left-wing agendas involving intersectional politics or class reductionism, and right-wing nationalist agendas of exclusion of national or ethnic ""others."" 
The term identity politics dates to the late twentieth century, although it had precursors in the writings of individuals such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Frantz Fanon. Many contemporary advocates of identity politics take an intersectional perspective, which they argue accounts for a range of interacting systems of oppression that may affect a person's life and originate from their various identities. To these advocates, identity politics helps center the experiences of those they view as facing systemic oppression so that society can better understand the interplay of different forms of demographic-based oppression and ensure that no one group is disproportionately affected by political actions. Contemporary identity labels—such as people of specific race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, economic class, disability status, education, religion, language, profession, political party, veteran status, recovery status, or geographic location—are not mutually exclusive but are, in many cases, compounded into one when describing hyper-specific groups. An example is that of African-American homosexual women, who can constitute a particular hyper-specific identity class. 
Criticism of identity politics often comes from either the center-right or the far-left on the political spectrum. Many socialists, anarchists and Marxists have criticized identity politics for its divisive nature, claiming that it forms identities that can undermine their goals of proletariat unity and class struggle. On the other hand, many conservative think tanks and media outlets have criticized identity politics for other reasons, such as that it is inherently collectivist and prejudicial. Center-right critics of identity politics have seen it as particularist, in contrast to the universalism espoused by many liberal politics, or argue that it detracts attention from non-identity based structures of oppression and exploitation. 
A leftist critique of identity politics, such as that of Nancy Fraser, argues that political mobilization based on identitarian affirmation leads to surface redistribution—that is, a redistribution within existing structures and relations of production that does not challenge the status quo. Instead, Fraser argued, identitarian deconstruction, rather than affirmation, is more conducive to leftist goals of economic redistribution. Similarly, Marxist academics such as Kurzwelly, Pére",politics
Darts,"Darts is a competitive sport in which two or more players bare-handedly throw small sharp-pointed projectiles known as darts at a round target known as a dartboard.
Points can be scored by hitting specific marked areas of the board, though unlike in sports such as archery, these areas are distributed all across the board and do not follow a principle of points increasing toward the board's bullseye. Though a number of similar games using various boards and rules exist, the term ""darts"" usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules.
Darts is both a professional throwing sport and a traditional pub game.  Darts is commonly played in the British Isles, and recreationally enjoyed around the world.

History
In 1908, darts was declared to be a game of skill and was thus allowed to be played in pubs. This came about after the landlord of the Adelphi Inn in Leeds was prosecuted for allowing darts to be played in his pub. As darts was considered a game of chance at the time, it was not allowed on licensed premises. The landlord was supported in his case by the best darts player in the region, William 'Bigfoot' Anakin. A dartboard was hung in the court and Anakin proved that darts was not a game of chance by hitting three double 20s in a row.

Dartboard
The original target in the game is likely to have been a section of a tree trunk, its circular shape and concentric rings giving rise to the standard dartboard pattern in use today.  An older name for a dartboard is ""butt""; the word comes from the French word but, meaning ""target"" or ""goal"".
The standard numbered point system is attributed to Lancashire carpenter Brian Gamlin, who devised it in 1896 to penalise inaccuracy, though this is disputed. Many configurations have been used, varying by time and location. In particular, the Yorkshire and Manchester Log End boards differ from the standard board in that they have no triple, only double and bullseye.  The Manchester board is smaller than the standard, with a playing area of only 25 cm (9.8 in) across, with double and bull areas measuring just 4 mm (0.16 in).  The London Fives board is another variation, with only 12 equal segments, with the doubles and triples being a quarter of an inch (6.35 mm) wide.
Mathematically, removing the rotational symmetry by placing the ""20"" at the top, there are 19 factorial, or 121,645,100,408,832,000 possible dartboards. Many different layouts would penalise a player more than the current setup; however, the current setup actually does the job rather efficiently. There have been several mathematical papers published that consider the ""optimal"" dartboard.
Before World War I, pubs in the United Kingdom had dartboards made from solid blocks of wood, usually elm. But darts pocked the surface of elm such that it was common for a hole to develop around the treble twenty. The other problem was that elm wood needed periodic soaking to keep the wood soft.

Economics of religion,"The economics of religion concerns both the application of the techniques of economics to the study of religion and the relationship between economic and religious behaviours. Contemporary writers on the subject trace it back to Adam Smith (1776).
Empirical work examines the causal influence of religion in microeconomics to explain individual behaviour and in the macroeconomic determinants of economic growth. Religious economics (or theological economics) is a related subject sometimes overlapping or conflated with the economics of religion.

History
Adam Smith laid a foundation for economic analysis for religion in The Wealth of Nations (1776), stating that religious organisations are subject to market forces, incentive and competition problems like any other sector of the economy. Max Weber later identified a relationship between religion and economic behaviour, attributing in 1905 the modern advent of capitalism to the Protestant reformation.

Religion and individual behaviour
Research highlights the importance of religious orthodoxy on moral behaviours and versions of the Golden Rule “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you” are common to most major religions. Others argue it promotes cooperation and trust within culturally defined groups or clubs. Studies compare the complementary effects of religious values such as charity, forgiveness, honesty and tolerance and religious social groups where membership instils favouritism or discrimination towards in or outgroup members.

Believing
The believing channel of religion behaviours concerns costly effort concerned with divine reputation. Azzi and Ehrenberg (1975) propose individuals allocate time and money to secular and religious institutions to maximise utility in this life and the afterlife. The colonisation of religious minds by the morally concerned supernatural or “Big Gods” diffused behaviours derived from moral instruction.

Belonging
The belonging approach to religion considers the social notion of between and within religious groups. Iannaconne (1998) assigns religion as a 'club good' from a rational choice perspective where costly rituals exclude free-riders from in-group benefits. Field experiments also evidence religious people are more trusting and cooperative with fellow religious adherents. Many experimental studies suggest group belonging has a greater influence on behaviour than belief orthodoxy. As Darwin (1874) among others argue, the promotion of cooperative in-group behaviours is not unique to religious networks.

Experimental economics of religion
Experimental methods can be applied to isolate the effect of religion on behaviour patterns and to distinguish between believing versus belonging channels. Experimental methods are useful in the economics of religion to standardise measurement and identify causal effect. Methods include looking at religion in various games – Prisoner's dilemma, public goods game, ultimatum game, dictator game and parametric choice. Gen",economics
Fedspeak,"In monetary policy of the United States, the term Fedspeak (also known as Greenspeak) is what Alan Blinder called ""a turgid dialect of English"" used by Federal Reserve Board chairs in making wordy, vague, and ambiguous statements. The strategy, which was used most prominently by Alan Greenspan, was used to prevent financial markets from overreacting to the chairman's remarks. The coinage is an intentional parallel to Newspeak.
Fedspeak when used by Alan Greenspan is often called Greenspeak.  An alternative definition of Greenspeak is ""the coded and careful language employed by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.""
Edwin le Heron and Emmanuel Carre state that ""Nowadays, 'Fedspeak' (Bernanke, 2004) means clear and extensive communication of the Fed's action."" Chairman Ben Bernanke and Chairwoman Yellen have effected a major change in Fed communication policy departing from the obfuscation that characterized the previous three decades. In 2014 a new detailed level of Fed communication was dubbed Fedspeak 3.0. In 2018, Chairman Jerome Powell would begin press conferences with a summary statement in plain English, in contrast to his predecessors who would read lengthy prepared statements loaded with monetary policy jargon.
In 2021, Powell used a recursive syntax in saying that ""you can think of this meeting that we had as the 'talking about talking about' meeting.""  He added, ""I now suggest that we retire that term.""

Origin
The notion of fed speak originated from the fact that financial markets placed a heavy value on the statements made by Federal Reserve governors, which could in turn lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. To prevent this, the governors developed a language, termed Fedspeak, in which ambiguous and cautious statements were made to purposefully obscure and detract meaning from the statement.
Though previous ""Fed"" chairmen Arthur Burns and Paul Volcker were known for blowing smoke, both literally and figuratively, when appearing before Congress, Alan Greenspan is credited with making Fedspeak a ""high-art"". It is unclear whether the term Fedspeak was used widely prior to Greenspan, but with historical hindsight the modern term could be used to describe Burns's and Volcker's method.

Usage by Alan Greenspan
Although it was originally believed by some that Alan Greenspan, who is generally credited for popularizing Fedspeak, may have used such language unintentionally, he revealed in his 2007 book The Age of Turbulence,  that the method of avoiding the issues directly when a clear message was not desired was indeed intentional. Greenspan states that the confusion, which often resulted in conflicting interpretations, was used to prevent unintended jolts to the markets as confusing statements were typically ignored.
He noted that he came upon the dialect while at the Fed: ""What I've learned at the Federal Reserve is a new language which is called 'Fed-speak'. You soon learn to mumble with great incoherence.""

Bruno Reichart,"Bruno Reichart (born 18 January 1943) is a retired German cardiothoracic surgeon who performed Germany's first successful heart transplant in 1981 and its first combined heart–lung transplant in 1983.
In 1984, he succeeded Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town and was appointed president of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) from 1988 to 1990. He returned to Munich in 1990 as director of the Cardiac Surgery Clinic at the Klinikum Großhadern of the University of Munich (LMU).
He has also been active in experimental research in xenotransplantation and from 2011 became a spokesman for funded research into the transplantation of pig tissue and organs into primates, with a team involving veterinarians, virologists, clinicians, lawyers and ethicists.

Early life and education
Bruno Reichart was born in Vienna in 1943 and grew up in Ingolstadt. He studied medicine at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg and Munich University, now called Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) and received his MD in 1968, after which he became a medical assistant at the First Gynecological Clinic of the University of Munich, the Surgical Department of the Municipal Hospital Munich-Harlaching and at the Medical Clinic of the University of Munich.

Early surgical career
From 1971 to 1973, Reichart worked as a surgical assistant under surgeon Rudolf Zenker and within a year was appointed visiting cardiac physician in Memphis, Tennessee, where he focused on heart, lung, and vascular surgery.
Upon his return to Munich in 1974, Reichart commenced surgery at the Cardiac Surgery Clinic at the LMU. In 1977 he became its senior physician and a year later he passed his habilitation with the topic ""The mechanical support of acute right heart failure"", and become a cardiothoracic surgeon in 1978.

Heart transplant 1981
On 19 August 1981, Reichart performed Germany's first successful heart transplant at the LMU. The procedure was previously performed more than 10 years earlier in 1969, when two heart transplants took place in the Cardiac Surgery Clinic at the LMU, but they were both unsuccessful, with one dying within two days of surgery, from a coronary thrombosis. Reichart's attempt in 1981 involved a 32-year old recipient who had experienced a heart attack a year earlier and was left with severely impaired left ventricular function. During the year until heart transplant, the recipient also experienced a large blood clot in the lung, acute heart failure and a stomach ulcer. The 23 year  old donor had been killed in a road traffic accident ten days prior to transplant. Azathioprine, cortisone and Anti-thymocyte globulin were the immunosuppressants used until two rejection episodes resulted in changing therapy to cyclosporine A three weeks after surgery and they were discharged from hospital at Christmas 1981.

Farm gate value,"The farm gate value of a cultivated product in agriculture and aquaculture 
 is the market value of a product minus the selling costs (transport costs, marketing costs).
The market value is not the same as the price farmers get for their product, as (if an auction is used), the value they get per weight may be well below the market price. In some cases, the value they get per weight may even be below the breakeven price.
When selling by auction, the price the farmers get for their product is typically lower than the price they get if they sell directly to the consumer (as they are able to set this price themselves).
The farm gate value is also lower than the retail price consumers pay in a store as it does not include the additional costs the store makes (shipping, handling, storage, marketing) nor the profit margin the involved companies ask.

History of Punjab,"The History of Punjab is the history of the Punjab region which is a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in the northwest of South Asia, comprising the Punjab province in Pakistan and the Punjab state in India. It is believed that the earliest evidence of human habitation in Punjab traces to the Soan valley of the Pothohar, between the Indus and the Jhelum rivers, where Soanian culture developed between 774,000 BC and 11,700 BC. This period goes back to the first interglacial period in the second Ice Age, from which remnants of stone and flint tools have been found.
The Punjab region was the site of one of the earliest cradle of civilizations, the Bronze Age Harrapan civilization that flourished from about 3000 B.C. and declined rapidly 1,000 years later, following the Indo-Aryan migrations that overran the region in waves between 1500 and 500 B.C. The migrating Indo-Aryan tribes gave rise to the Iron Age Vedic civilization, which lasted till 500 BC. During this era, the Rigveda was composed in Punjab, laying the foundation of Hinduism. In the 6th century BC, Pushkarasarin, the monarch of Gandhara, assumed a role in halting the expansionary ambitions of the Achaemenid Empire until during the reign of Darius wherein tribute rendered by Gandhara to him is first documented. A century later, the Janapadas of Punjab encountered the expansive undertakings of Alexander. The Janapadas exhibited resistance to his advances, notably the Aśvaka of Gandhara, the Mallians of South Punjab, and Porus of Central Punjab. Following the demise of Alexander, Chandragupta Maurya, who had received his education in the city of Taxila, garnered support from republics such as Trigarta and Gandhara. He subsequently conquered the Nanda Empire, with Taxila being designated as the provincial capital of the Northwestern territories. After its decline, the Indo-Greeks, Indo-Sakas and Indo-Parthians successively established reigns in Punjab however during this time a local kingdom known as the Apracharajas, maintained autonomy and other janapadas such as that of the Yaudheya and the Audumbaras in Eastern Punjab resisted their expansions. In the late 1st century AD the Kushan Empire annexed Punjab, Gandharas cultural zenith occurred during this period in which artwork from the region flourished.
The devastating Hunnic invasions of Punjab occurred in the 5th and 6th century, which were ultimately repelled by the Vardhana dynasty. Most of the western Punjab region became unified under the Taank and Odi Shahi Kingdoms in the early medieval period. Between the 8th and 12th century, the Tomara dynasty and Katoch dynasty controlled the eastern portions of Punjab. Islam became established in Punjab when the Umayyad Caliphate conquered southern portions of the region up to Multan, which became independent from the caliphate under the Emirate of Multan in 855. The Ghaznavids conquered region in 1025, after whom the Delhi Sultanate followed. The Langah Sultanate ruled much of the",history
Community-supported agriculture,"Community-supported agriculture (CSA model) or cropsharing is a system that connects producers and consumers within the food system closer by allowing the consumer to subscribe to the harvest of a certain farm or group of farms. It is an alternative socioeconomic model of agriculture and food distribution that allows the producer and consumer to share the risks of farming. The model is a subcategory of civic agriculture that has an overarching goal of strengthening a sense of community through local markets.
Community-supported agriculture can be considered as a practice of Commoning. It is an example of community-led management of the production and distribution of goods and services. The organization of food provisioning through commoning is complementary to the horizontal axis of market mediated food provisioning and the verticality of the state distribution and regulation on food. As a model where market agents do not interact solely as competitors but as “members of a community collaborating in pursuing a collective action for the commonwealth” it is also recognized and supported by public policies in some countries. Such frameworks of collaboration between public administration and the cooperative sector are known as Public-Commons-Partnerships (PCP) and have also been established in relation to food. As a prefigurative practice that decommodifies food and “strengthens the imaginary of community as a source of reward and space of emancipation“ CSA has been acknowledged as an important step-stone in a sustainability transition in agri-food systems.
In return for subscribing to a harvest, subscribers receive either a weekly or bi-weekly box of produce or other farm goods. This includes in-season fruits, vegetables, and can expand to dried goods, eggs, milk, meat, etc. Typically, farmers try to cultivate a relationship with subscribers by sending weekly letters of what is happening on the farm, inviting them for harvest, or holding an open-farm event. Some CSAs provide for contributions of labor in lieu of a portion of subscription costs.
The term CSA is mostly used in the United States, Canada and the UK but a variety of similar production and economic sub-systems are in use worldwide and in Austria and Germany as Solidarische Landwirtschaft (lit. 'solidarity agriculture', abbreviated to Solawi).

History
The term ""community-supported agriculture"" was coined in the northeastern United States in the 1980s, influenced by European biodynamic agriculture ideas formulated by Rudolf Steiner. Two European farmers, Jan Vander Tuin from Switzerland and Trauger Groh from Germany, brought European biodynamic farming ideas to the United States in the mid-1980s. Vander Tuin had co-founded a community-supported agricultural project named Topinambur located near Zurich, Switzerland. Coinage of the term ""community-supported agriculture"" stems from Vander Tuin. This influence led to the separate and simultaneous creation of two CSAs in 1986. The CSA Garden at",economics
Auriculotherapy,"Auriculotherapy (also auricular therapy, ear acupuncture, and auriculoacupuncture) is a form of alternative medicine based on the idea that the ear is a micro system and an external organ, which reflects the entire body, represented on the auricle, the outer portion of the ear. Conditions affecting the physical, mental or emotional health of the patient are assumed to be treatable by stimulation of the surface of the ear exclusively. Similar mappings are used by several modalities, including the practices of reflexology and iridology. These mappings are not based on or supported by any medical or scientific evidence, and are therefore considered to be pseudoscience.

History and development
French neurologist Paul Nogier invented auriculotherapy in 1957.  Nogier developed a phrenological method of projection of a fetal Homunculus on the ear and published what he called the ""Vascular Autonomic Signal"" which measured a change in the amplitude of the pulse.  That mechanism would only produce a signal upon the introduction of new information to the electromagnetic field of the patient.  Nogier cited a 'principle of matching resonance' which he could use the vascular autonomic signal to detect the active points of the auricular microsystem.
Nogier's Auricular acupuncture was introduced to China in 1958.
A variation of auriculotherapy called ""ear stapling"" involves the long-term insertion of a medical staple in the conchal bowl of the ear. Advocates variously claim that the procedure aids in losing weight, stopping smoking, and managing stress.

Battlefield acupuncture
In 2001 Richard Niemtzow developed a procedure he called ""battlefield acupuncture"", in an attempt to research more efficient relief for phantom limb pain and chronic pain for veterans. Battlefield Acupuncture involves placing gold aiguille semi-permanent needles at up to five sites in the ears.  In 2018, the United States Department of Defense, the Veterans Center for Integrative Pain Management, and the Veterans Health Administration National Pain Management Program office completed a 3-year, $5.4 million acupuncture education and training program, which trained over 2800 providers in Battlefield Acupuncture. Retired U.S. Air Force flight surgeon Harriet Hall characterized the Department of Defense's use of acupuncture and auriculotherapy as an embarrassing ""infiltration of quackery into military medicine"", a waste of tax dollars, and a potential harm to patients.

Nogier points
The principles of auriculotherapy are contrary to known anatomy and physiology of the human body.
According to Nogier, the relevant structures include:

Helix, the outer prominent rim of the auricle
Antihelix, the elevated ridge anterior and parallel to the helix
Triangular fossa, a triangular depression
Scapha, the narrow curved depression between the helix and the antihelix
Tragus, the small, curved flap in front of the auricle
Antitragus, the small tubercle opposite to the tragus

Snow volleyball,"Snow volleyball is a winter team sport played by two teams of three players on a snow court divided by a net. The objective of each team is to score points by sending a ball over the net so as to ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent the same effort by the opponent. A team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net, and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.
The sport originated in Austria as a variant of beach volleyball, with a local Snow Volleyball Tour being established in 2009. The sport gained recognition by the European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) in 2015, and the following year saw the inaugural CEV Snow Volleyball European Tour, followed by the inaugural FIVB Snow Volleyball World Tour in 2019. The Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) is the international governing body for the sport.

History
Volleyball has been played on snow for decades, especially in countries such as Russia, Austria and Switzerland, even though without any specifically codified rules, but simply as a variation of the Volleyball game on snow. Unofficial Snow Volleyball competitions were held in Austria and Switzerland in the late 90s, before the idea reemerged in 2008, upon the initiative of Martin Kaswurm, a local promoter. The sport gained popularity in Wagrain, Austria, in 2008, and the first Snow Volleyball Tour was set up the following year. It was recognized as an official sport by the Austrian Volleyball Association in 2011. Initially taking place across Austria, the Tour expanded to include stops in other European countries by 2013. The European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) officially added the sport in October 2015 and organized the first CEV Snow Volleyball European Tour in 2016. The inaugural CEV European Snow Volleyball Championships took place in March 2018 in Austria. A Snow Volleyball European Tour under the umbrella of the CEV has taken place yearly ever since, with events held in countries as diverse as Austria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Italy, Liechtenstein, Russia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Turkey, while national championships qualifying to the inaugural European Championships were organised by 17 National Federations in the winter of 2018. According to Yahoo Sports, the International Volleyball Federation and the European Volleyball Confederation recruited beach volleyball Olympians from countries like Brazil, China, South Korea, and Austria to compete in a demonstration at the Austria House, where the athletes donned warm clothing, gloves, and soccer cleats to bump, set, and spike on a snowy court. 
With plans to make snow volleyball part of the future Winter Olympic Games programme, the FIVB and the CEV recruited former beach volleyball Olympians to compete in a demonstration of the sport at the 2018 Winter Olympics.  Since then, more efforts have been made to increase global participation in the sport. In the first tournament of the 2018–19 European Tour season, teams from ",sports
Craxism,"Craxism (Italian: Craxismo) is a political ideology based on the thought of Italian socialist leader Bettino Craxi, who was Prime Minister of Italy during the 1980s. Craxism was the informal doctrine of the Italian Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Italiano; PSI) from 1976 to 1994, the year when both the First Republic and the PSI itself were dissolved due to corruption scandals.

Origins and features
Craxism, although considered a derogatory term today, was based on a synthesis of social democracy, socialism and liberal conservatism. Although the PSI under Craxi was associated with typical centre-left stances such as third-worldism, pro-Arabism, environmentalism and a belief in the modern welfare state, it was also pro-Atlanticist and pro-europeanist, supported privatisation and liberalisation measures, and placed a strong emphasis on defending territorial sovereignty (e.g. the Sigonella crisis) and on promoting conservative policies relating to issues such as abortion and the war on drugs.
Thus, under Craxi the PSI moved from being on the left, close to the Italian Communist Party (Partito Comunista Italiano; PCI), to a position much nearer the centre. This allowed the party to ally with the Christian Democrats and sundry other moderate parties, thereby helping to provide a stable governing coalition throughout the 1980s (known informally as the Pentapartito).

Critics and supporters
In Italy, the main critics of Craxism (as well as of Craxi himself) are mostly either former Communist politicians – including many current members of the Democratic Party – or writers in left-wing newspapers (Il Fatto Quotidiano, il manifesto, L'Espresso, La Repubblica, etc.). Its biggest supporters, meanwhile, are the PSI of Riccardo Nencini and various politicians from the centre right, most notably Silvio Berlusconi (a close associate of Craxi in the 1980s), Renato Brunetta, Maurizio Sacconi, Stefano Caldoro and Stefania Craxi, Bettino's daughter. Abroad, Craxi received fulsome praise from figures such as Mário Soares, Ricardo Lagos, Felipe González, Lech Walesa, Ronald Reagan, Sergio Romano (Italian Ambassador in the USA), Renato Ruggiero (Socialist diplomat and former Director of the WTO) and Boris Biancheri (writer and diplomat).

Influence

Craxism led to a change in the entire nature of European socialism. Together with fellow moderate socialist leaders such as Felipe González, François Mitterrand and Helmut Schmidt, Craxi moved socialism in a direction more favourable to liberal reformism and the market economy. In addition, Craxism later inspired the overhaul and redeveloped policies of Tony Blair's Labour Party in Britain, the PSOE under José Zapatero, and Andreas Papandreou's PASOK in Greece.

Khuru (sport),"Khuru (Dzongkha: ཁུ་རུ་; Wylie: khu-ru) is a traditional Bhutanese dart sport. Unlike archery, playing khuru is simple and affordable. It's a game where you get a pair of darts and a target to aim at. Khuru is usually played on holidays and other special events all around the nation and is just as popular as archery.
The distance between two targets is 35 meters for men and 27 meters for women, according to the Bhutan Indigenous Games and Sports Association. With the cultural shift, even the women participate in Khuru tournaments.

Khuru Rules
The Bhutan Indigenous Games and Sports Association (BIGSA) was established with the goal of promoting traditional Bhutanese games and sports. But BIGSA has no khuru rules mentioned in their website.

Residual feed intake,"Residual feed intake (sometimes shortened in literature to RFI) is a resource allocation theory index used to calculate the feed efficiency of growing cattle. It was developed by Robert M. Koch in 1963 as an answer to the difficulties of using a feed conversion ratio to compare individual animals. Effective use of RFI data can greatly improve beef cattle farm profits. This approach is based on regression models developed  for determining efficiency of feed use for weight gain during a  standardized growth trial in growing beef cattle.
It was inspired by Koch's observations of the differences in how a maintained body weight and an increasing body weight affect the feeding of cattle. His research suggested that feed intake could be broken into two parts:

The expected feed intake for the animal's level of production.
The residual portion between the amount of feed the animal is expected to eat, and what the animal actually eats.
Through the use of these two items, animals that deviate from the expected feed intake, either by eating more than or less than what's expected of them, can be identified and managed as the farmer sees fit. Because feed intake is heritable, knowing the RFI index of an animal is also useful when breeding. By selecting animals with the aim to reduce RFI, farmers can breed animals that eat less but continue at the same rate of production. 
There is no phenotype link between RFI and the characteristics used to calculate expected feed intake, which allows for the comparison of animals who function at differing production numbers. This has led some authors to believe that RFI is representative of individual differences in the metabolic processes of the animals. For example, one study shows that the amount of feed a Hereford bull requires to maintain a kilogram of body weight is closely related to genetic variation in its RFI. Similarly, in laying hens, variation in RFI is directly linked to variations in maintenance energy expenditure.

Flip-flop (politics),"A ""flip-flop"" (used mostly in the United States), U-turn (used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Pakistan, Malaysia, etc.), or backflip (used in Australia and New Zealand) is a derogatory term for a sudden real or apparent change of policy or opinion by a public official, sometimes while trying to claim that the two positions are consistent with each other. It carries connotations of pandering and hypocrisy. Often, flip-flops occur during the period prior to or following an election in order to maximize the candidate's popularity.

History
In his ""On Language"" column in The New York Times, William Safire wrote in 1988 that ""flip-flop"" has a long history as a synonym for ""somersault"". (He cited George Lorimer in 1902: ""when a fellow's turning flip-flops up among the clouds, he's naturally going to have the farmers gaping at him"".) In the late 19th century, a US politician was called ""the Florida flopper"" by an opponent, Safire noted. The ""fl"" sound appearing twice is an indication of ridicule, he wrote. Citing grammarian Randolph Quirk, Safire pointed out that the doubling of the sound is also a feature in other two-word phrases used to disparage the actions or words of others, including ""mumbo jumbo"", ""wishy-washy"", and ""higgledy-piggledy"".
In the archives of The New York Times, which go back to 1851, the earliest unequivocal mention of ""flip-flop"" as a change in someone's opinion is in an October 23, 1890 report of a campaign speech in New York City. John W. Goff, candidate for district attorney, said of one of his opponents: ""I would like to hear Mr. Nicoll explain his great flip-flop, for three years ago, you know, as the Republican candidate for District Attorney, he bitterly denounced Tammany as a party run by bosses and in the interest of bossism. ... Nicoll, who three years ago was denouncing Tammany, is its candidate to-day.""
The term was also used in 1967, when a New York Times editorial and Times columnist Tom Wicker used it in commenting on different events. It was also in the 1976 election, when President Gerald Ford used the phrase against his opponent Jimmy Carter. In the 1988 U.S. presidential election, Michael Dukakis used the term against opponent Richard Gephardt, saying, ""There's a flip-flopper over here"" about Gephardt.
The term also was used extensively in the 2004 U.S. presidential election campaign. It was used by critics as a catch-phrase attack on John Kerry, claiming he was ""flip-flopping"" his stance on several issues, including the ongoing war in Iraq. Famously, on March 16, 2004, during an appearance at Marshall University Kerry tried to explain his vote for an $87 billion supplemental appropriation for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan by telling the crowd, ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it."" After the remark became controversial, he explained that he had supported an earlier Democratic measure that would have paid for the $87 billion in war funding by reducing Bush's tax cuts",politics
Contract farming,"Contract farming involves agricultural production being carried out on the basis of an agreement between the buyer and farm producers. Sometimes it involves the buyer specifying the quality required and the price, with the farmer agreeing to deliver at a future date. More commonly, however, contracts outline conditions for the production of farm products and for their delivery to the buyer's premises. The farmer undertakes to supply agreed quantities of a crop or livestock product, based on the quality standards and delivery requirements of the purchaser. In return, the buyer, usually a company, agrees to buy the product, often at a price that is established in advance. The company often also agrees to support the farmer through, e.g., supplying inputs, assisting with land preparation, providing production advice and transporting produce to its premises. The term ""outgrower scheme"" is sometimes used synonymously with contract farming, most commonly in Eastern and Southern Africa. Contract farming can be used for many agricultural products, although in developing countries it is less common for staple crops such as rice and maize.

Key benefits
Contract farming has been used for agricultural production for decades but its popularity appears to have been increasing in recent years. The use of contracts has become attractive to many farmers because the arrangement can offer both an assured market and access to production support. Contract farming is also of interest to buyers, who seek supplies of products for sale further along the value chain or for processing. Processors constitute the main users of contracts, as the guaranteed supply enables them to maximise utilization of their processing capacity. Contracts with farmers can also reduce risk from disease or weather and facilitate certification, which is being increasingly demanded by advanced markets. There are also potential benefits for national economies as contract farming leads to economies of scale, which, as Collier and Dercon argue, are ""bound to provide for a more dynamic agricultural sector.
Although contract farming must first and foremost be considered as a commercial proposition, it has also come to be viewed as an effective approach to help solve many of the market access and input supply problems faced by small farmers. A guide published by GIZ in 2013 seeks to advise on ways in which contract farming can be developed to maximise such benefits for smallholders in developing countries. Effective linkages between companies and thousands of farmers often require the involvement of formal farmer associations or cooperatives or, at least, informal farmer groups. However, empirical evidence of the best way of achieving this is not yet available.

Types
Eaton and Shepherd identify five different contract farming models. Under the centralized model a company provides support to smallholder production, purchases the crop, and then processes or markets it, closely controlling its quality. ",economics
Defection,"In politics, a defector is a person who gives up allegiance to one state in exchange for allegiance to another, changing sides in a way which is considered illegitimate by the first state. More broadly, defection involves abandoning a person, cause, or doctrine to which one is bound by some tie, as of allegiance or duty.
This term is also applied, often pejoratively, to anyone who switches loyalty to another religion, sports team, political party, or other rival faction. In that sense, the defector is often considered a traitor by their original side.

International politics
The physical act of defection is usually in a manner which violates the laws of the nation or political entity from which the person is seeking to depart. By contrast, mere changes in citizenship, or working with allied militia, usually do not violate any law(s).
For example, in the 1950s, East Germans were increasingly prohibited from traveling to the western Federal Republic of Germany where they were automatically regarded as citizens according to Exclusive mandate. The Berlin Wall (1961) and fortifications along the Inner German border (1952 onward) were erected by the Communist German Democratic Republic to enforce the policy. When people tried to ""defect"" from the GDR they were to be shot on sight. Several hundred people were killed along that border in their Republikflucht attempt. Official crossings did exist, but permissions to leave temporarily or permanently were seldom granted. On the other hand, the GDR citizenship of some ""inconvenient"" East Germans was revoked, and they had to leave their home on short notice against their will. Others, like singer Wolf Biermann, were prohibited from returning to the GDR.

During the Cold War, the many people illegally emigrating from the Soviet Union or Eastern Bloc to the West were called defectors. Westerners defected to the Eastern Bloc as well, often to avoid prosecution as spies. Some of the more famous cases were British spy Kim Philby, who defected to the USSR to avoid exposure as a KGB mole, and 22 Allied POWs (one Briton and twenty-one Americans) who declined repatriation after the Korean War, electing to remain in China.
When an individual leaves their country and provides information to a foreign intelligence service, they are considered a HUMINT source defector. In some cases, defectors remain in the country or with the political entity they were against, functioning as a defector in place. Intelligence services are always concerned when debriefing defectors with the possibility of a fake defection.
Entire militaries can defect and choose not to follow orders from a state's leaders. During the Arab Spring protests, militaries in Egypt and Tunisia refused orders to fire upon protesters or use other methods to disperse them. The decision to defect can be driven by the desire to prevent insubordination: if a military leader judges that lower officers will disobey orders to fire upon protesters, they could be more like",politics

Superslow process,"Superslow processes are processes in which values change so little that their capture is very difficult because of their smallness in comparison with the measurement error.

Applications
Most of the time, the superslow processes lie beyond the scope of investigation due to the reason of their superslowness.  Multiple gaps can be easily detected in biology, astronomy, physics, mechanics, economics, linguistics, ecology, gerontology, etc.

Biology: Traditional scientific research in this area was focused on the describing some brain reactions.
Mathematics: In mathematics, when the fluid flows through thin and long tubes it forms stagnation zones where the flow becomes almost immobile.  If the ratio of tube length to its diameter is large, then the potential function and stream function are almost invariable on very extended areas.  The situation seems uninteresting, but if we remember that these minor changes occur in the extra-long intervals, we see here a series of first-class tasks that require the development of special mathematical methods.
Mathematics: Apriori information regarding the stagnation zones  contributes to optimization of the computational process by replacing the unknown functions with the corresponding constants in such zones.  Sometimes this makes it possible to significantly reduce the amount of computation, for example in approximate calculation of conformal mappings of strongly elongated rectangles.
Economic Geography: The obtained results are particularly useful for applications in economic geography.  In a case where the function describes the intensity of commodity trade, a theorem about its stagnation zones gives us (under appropriate restrictions on the selected  model) geometric dimensions estimates of the stagnation zone of the world-economy (for more information about a stagnation zone of the world-economy, see Fernand Braudel, Les Jeux de L'echange).
For example, if the subarc of a domain boundary has zero transparency, and the flow of the gradient vector field of the function through the rest of the boundary is small enough, then the domain for such function is its stagnation zone.
Stagnation zones theorems are closely related to pre-Liouville's theorems about evaluation of solutions fluctuation, which direct consequences are the different versions of the classic Liouville theorem about conversion of the entire doubly periodic function into the identical constant.
Identification of what parameters impact the sizes of stagnation zones opens up opportunities for practical recommendations on targeted changes in configuration (reduction or increase) of such zones.

Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,"The Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, sold under the brand name Comirnaty, is an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine developed by the German biotechnology company BioNTech. For its development, BioNTech collaborated with the American company Pfizer to carry out clinical trials, logistics, and manufacturing. It is authorized for use in humans to provide protection against COVID-19, caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The vaccine is given by intramuscular injection. It is composed of nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA) that encodes a mutated form of the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. Initial guidance recommended a two-dose regimen, given 21 days apart; this interval was subsequently extended to up to 42 days in the United States, and up to four months in Canada.
Clinical trials began in April 2020; by November 2020, the vaccine had met the primary efficacy goals of the phase III clinical trial, with over 40,000 people participating. Interim analysis of study data showed a potential efficacy of 91.3% in preventing symptomatic infection within seven days of a second dose and no serious safety concerns. Most side effects are mild to moderate in severity and resolve within a few days. Common side effects include mild to moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headaches. Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, remain very rare with no long-term complications documented.
The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first to be approved for regular use. In December 2020, the United Kingdom was the first country to authorize its use on an emergency basis. It is authorized for use at some level in the majority of countries. On 23 August 2021, the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine became the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The logistics of distributing and storing the vaccine present significant challenges due to the requirement for its storage at extremely low temperatures.
In August 2022, a bivalent version of the vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent) was authorized for use as a booster dose in individuals aged twelve and older in the US. The following month, the BA.1 version of the bivalent vaccine (Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 or tozinameran/riltozinameran) was authorized as a booster for use in the UK. The same month, the European Union authorized both the BA.1 and the BA.4/BA.5 (tozinameran/famtozinameran) booster versions of the bivalent vaccine. In August 2024, the FDA approved and granted emergency authorization for a monovalent Omicron KP.2 version of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The approval of Comirnaty (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) (2024-2025 Formula) was granted to BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH. The EUA amendment for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (2024-2025 Formula) was issued to Pfizer Inc.

Two-up,"Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated ""spinner"" throwing two coins, usually Australian pennies, into the air. Players bet on whether the coins will both fall with heads (obverse) up, both with tails (reverse) up, or one of each (known as ""odds""). The game is traditionally played in pubs and clubs throughout Australia on Anzac Day, in part to mark a shared experience with diggers (soldiers).
The game is traditionally played with pennies, because their weight, size, and surface design make them ideal for the game. Weight and size make them stable on the ""kip"" and easy to spin in the air. Decimal coins are generally considered to be too small and light and do not fly as well. The design of pre-1939 pennies had the sovereign's head on the obverse (front) and the reverse was totally covered in writing, making the result very easy and quick to see. However, pennies used in the game are usually now marked with a white cross on the tails side. Pennies being used at games on Anzac Day are brought out specifically for that purpose each year.

History
The exact origins of two-up are obscure, but it seems to have evolved from cross and pile, a gambling game involving tossing a single coin into the air and wagering on the result. Two-up was popular amongst poorer English and Irish citizens in the 18th century. 
The predilection of the convicts for this game was noted as early as 1798 by New South Wales's first judge advocate, as well as the lack of skill involved and the large losses. By the 1850s, the two-coin form was being played on the goldfields of the eastern colonies, and it spread across the country following subsequent gold rushes.
Two-up was played extensively by Australia's soldiers during World War I. Gambling games, to which a blind eye was cast, became a regular part of Anzac Day celebrations for returned soldiers, although two-up was illegal at all other times.
As time passed, increasingly elaborate illegal ""two-up schools"" grew around Australia, to the consternation of authorities  but with the backing of corrupt police. The legendary Thommo's Two-up School, which operated at various locations in Surry Hills, Sydney, from the early years of the 20th century until at least 1979, was one of Australia's first major illegal gambling operations.
The popularity of two-up declined after the 1950s as more sophisticated forms of gambling like baccarat gained popularity in illegal gaming houses as well as when poker machines (slot machines) were legalised in clubs.
Legal two-up arrived with its introduction as a table game at the new casino in Hobart in 1973, but is now only offered at Crown Perth and Crown Melbourne. Two-up has also been legalised on Anzac Day, when it is played in Returned Servicemen's League (RSL) clubs and hotels. Several tourist ""two-up schools"" in the Outback have also been legalised.  Under the NSW Gambling (Two-Up) Act 1998, playing two-up in NSW is not unlawful on Anzac Day.

Animal studies,"Animal studies is a recently recognised field in which animals are studied in a variety of cross-disciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields, including art history, anthropology, biology, film studies, geography, history, psychology, literary studies, museology, philosophy, communication, and sociology. They engage with questions about notions of ""animality,"" ""animalization,"" or ""becoming animal,"" to understand human-made representations of and cultural ideas about ""the animal"" and what it is to be human by employing various theoretical perspectives. Using these perspectives, those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both human-animal relations now and in the past as defined by our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing, scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field.

History
Animal studies became popular in the 1970s as an interdisciplinary subject, animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study such as journals and books series, etc. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons, and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies. Historically, the field of environmental history has encouraged attention to animals.

Ethics
Throughout Western history, humankind has put itself above the ""nonhuman species."" In part, animal studies developed out of the animal liberation movement and was grounded in ethical questions about co-existence with other species: whether it is moral to eat animals, to do scientific research on animals for human benefit, and so on. Take rats, for example, with a history of being used as “an experimental subject, feeder, and “pest.” However, fewer than 10% of research studies on animals result in new medical findings for human patients. This has led researchers to find new Non-animal Approach Methodologies (NAMs) that provide more accurate human reactions. Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite Australian philosopher Peter Singer's 1975 work, Animal Liberation, as a founding document in animal studies. Singer's work followed Jeremy Bentham's by trying to expand utilitarian questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other sentient creatures. Overall, progress happens slowly, but the marginal voices help introduce new concepts and ethics that can eventually transform society's relationship with other species.
Some still believe that the primary purpose of animal interaction is solely for food. However, animal domestication created a new intimate bond between human and non-human, and changed the way that humans live their lives. Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature, culture, and Continental philosophy also consider the late work of Jacques Derrida a driving force b",science
Cotton Price Stabilization Board,"The Cotton Price Stabilization Board (French: Caisse de Stabilisation des Prix du Coton, CSPC) was a Chadian governative board created in 1965. Its task was to stabilize prices paid to peasant producers by funding operating losses incurred by Cotontchad, the parastatal giant that bought, ginned and sold all the cotton produced in Chad. The CSPC also played an important role in the program to improve yields: it is estimated that between 1971 and 1983 57% of all payments by the CSPC were made in conjunction with the program to improve cotton production. As for the funding of the CSPC, between 1971 and 1983, virtually all income to the CSPC derived from rebates paid by Cotontchad into the system. After 1984 the sharply reduced income of Cotontchad made the system for paying the producers heavily dependent on external sources of funds (such as Stabex), while the government completely exempted Cotontchad from the rebates to the CSPC. The difficulties of the CSPC, whose staffs had already been considerably reduced in the late 1980s, came to a head with the great recession that hit the cotton market between 1991 and 1993, leading to the abolition of the board in 1993. It was decided to let the prices paid to the producers fluctuate freely, following the international price of cotton.

Spatula Mundani,"The Spatula Mundani was a surgical device invented in the 17th century by the London surgeon James Woodall to treat extreme cases of severe constipation where purgatives had failed. Woodall believed that the cause of this malady was from scurvy, but speculation is that many of the cases were from the abuse of laudanum, a tincture of opium in alcohol commonly used at the time as a painkiller; opioid drugs are known to cause constipation by reducing gut motility. A drawing of the device is found in his 1617 book The Surgeons Mate.
The device was an iron tool slightly longer than 12 inches and consisted of a paddle at one end. The other end was spoon-shaped, with the center removed and a knob at the end. The spoon end was used to extract the ""hard excrements"" while the other was used for applying ointments, no doubt necessary after undergoing a procedure with this instrument.
The term mundani is apparently derived from the archaic term mundify which appeared in a dictionary from 1604 with the definition ""to make clean"".
On an archaeological dig at the Jamestown, Virginia, colonies a spatula mundani was found, and documents from 1608 report that it was part of a chest of surgeon's tools sent by Woodall to the colonies.

Pattern recognition,"Pattern recognition is the task of assigning a class to an observation based on patterns extracted from data. While similar, pattern recognition (PR) is not to be confused with pattern machines (PM) which may possess (PR) capabilities but their primary function is to distinguish and create emergent  patterns.   PR has applications in statistical data analysis, signal processing, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning. Pattern recognition has its origins in statistics and engineering; some modern approaches to pattern recognition include the use of machine learning, due to the increased availability of big data and a new abundance of processing power.
Pattern recognition systems are commonly trained from labeled ""training"" data. When no labeled data are available, other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns. KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and signal processing into consideration. It originated in engineering, and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
In machine learning, pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is classification, which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of classes (for example, determine whether a given email is ""spam""). Pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are regression, which assigns a real-valued output to each input; sequence labeling, which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values (for example, part of speech tagging, which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence); and parsing, which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence, describing the syntactic structure of the sentence.
Pattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform ""most likely"" matching of the inputs, taking into account their statistical variation. This is opposed to pattern matching algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors.

Overview
A modern definition of pattern recognition is:

The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into differe",science
Marching (sport),"In New Zealand and Australia, a competitive sport involving marching teams of young women grew up and became established from the 1930s.
Marching combines military precision with formations and elaborate costumes.
The sport had its origins during the Depression of the 1930s when teams were formed to keep young women fit and healthy. The sport became more organised during the 1940s with a system of scoring developed to ensure teams could compete against one another. Points were deducted for lack of precision, dressing, movement and length of pace. At its peak, marching competitions drew large crowds of spectators. 
Teams marched not only in competitions but also frequently appeared in parades and social occasions such as blossom festivals, A&P Shows and car race events.
Marching was the inspiration behind the television series Marching Girls which was developed for Television New Zealand and screened in New Zealand in 1987.
The Australian Marching Association (AMA) was the main officiating organisation for the sport in Australia up until 23 June 2012. On that date, at the organisation's Annual General Meeting, the sport unanimously approved the new name of DrillDance Australia to replace the name Australian Marching Association. DrillDance Australia is now the governing body. This rebranding marks a significant turning point in the sport in Australia as it takes steps to once again be a popular choice of activity for young people as well as those returning to the sport. Marching New Zealand (MNZ) is the main officiating organization for the sport in New Zealand. 
In Australia, teams compete in the U/8, U/12, U/17, Senior and Masters sections. Routines, depending on the age group, consist of Basic Drill, Technical Drill, Exhibition Drill, Thematic Drill, Thematic Dance and Prop DrillDance. Costumes, movements and music enhance each type of routine according to the team's chosen theme.
In New Zealand, teams compete in the Kiwi, Fernz, U/12, U/16, Senior, Master and Leisure grades in the Review and Inspection, Technical and Display drills.

Greek Dark Ages,"The Greek Dark Ages (c. 1180–800 BC) were earlier regarded as two continuous periods of Greek history: the Postpalatial Bronze Age (c. 1180–1050 BC) and the Prehistoric Iron Age or Early Iron Age (c. 1050–800 BC). The last included all the ceramic phases from the Protogeometric to the Middle Geometric and lasted until the beginning of the Historic Iron Age around 800 BC. Currently, the term Greek Dark Ages is being abandoned, and both periods are not considered ""obscure"".
At the beginning of the Postpalatial Bronze Age, the so-called Late Bronze Age collapse of civilization in the Eastern Mediterranean world in c. 1200–1150 BC took place, as the great palaces and cities of the Mycenaeans were destroyed or abandoned. At around the same time, the Hittite civilization also suffered serious disruption, with cities from Troy to Gaza being destroyed. In Egypt, the New Kingdom fell into disarray, leading to the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt. Following the collapse, there were fewer, smaller settlements, suggesting widespread famine and depopulation. In Greece, the Linear B script used by Mycenaean bureaucrats to write the Greek language ceased to be used, and the Greek alphabet did not develop until the beginning of the Protohistoric Iron Age, c. 800 BC.

Postpalatial Bronze Age
Mycenaean palaces began to come to an end around 1200 BC, and the process concluded decades later, due to internal tensions within the cities which rejected palatial authority and administration, patent in the disappearance of Linear B writing and palatial architecture. There were also conflicts, in the region of Boeotia, between Mycenaean polities like Orchomenos, Gla, and Thebes. Although Thebes and Eleon had an important reoccupation pattern even in Late Helladic IIIC Middle, c. 1170–1100 BC, when other minor sites around also began to rise, palaces had ceased to exist along with art and burial customs. 
On the other hand, in the island of Euboea, the site of Lefkandi grew up in an accelerated way in this Postpalatial period (1200–1050 BC) to become a preeminent place as it has a double bay with sea traffic. Additionally, evidence had emerged of the new presence of Hellenes in sub-Mycenaean Cyprus (c. 1100–1050 BC) and on the Syrian coast at Al-Mina. However, Greek-speaking people arrived in Cyprus, in the late 13th to 11th centuries BC, but did not colonize the island, they integrated into society as ""economic and cultural migrants from the periphery to the core.""

Early Iron Age
There were four centres in the following Prehistoric or Early Iron Age (1050–800 BC), with more than 1000 individuals: Lefkandi, Athens, Argos, and Knossos, which also featured sociopolitical complexity, hierarchies manifested locally though not in a wider area.  The decoration on Greek pottery after about 1050 BC lacks the figurative decoration of Mycenaean ware and is restricted to simpler, generally geometric styles: Early Protogeometric (1050–1000 BC), Middle Protogeometric (1000–950 BC), L",history
History of Socotra,"The history of the Yemenite archipelago of Socotra describes the cultures, events, peoples and strategic relevance for sea trade for the archipelago. Lying between the Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Sea and near major shipping routes, Socotra is the largest of the four islands in the Socotra archipelago.
Currently, the island is under the de facto control of the Southern Transitional Council, a United Arab Emirates-backed, pro-Presidential Leadership Council (PLC; Yemen's internationally recognized government), ""secessionist"" faction in Yemen's ongoing civil war.

Etymology
There is disagreement among scholars regarding the etymology of the island's name. The name Socotra may derive from:

A Greek term derived from the name of a South Arabian tribe mentioned in Sabaic and Ḥaḑramitic inscriptions as Dhū-Śakūrid (S³krd).
The Greek name Dioskouridon nēsos (Διοσκουρίδων νῆσος) meaning ""the island of the Dioscuri"".
The Arabic term Suqutra broken down as follows: Suq, means market, and qutra is a vulgar form of qatir, which refers to dragon's blood. Indeed, the capital city of Socotra was Suq as reported by the Portuguese in the 16th century, which they referred to as market place.

Prehistory
Socotra was inhabited around 2,000 to 4,000 years ago.

Ancient history
By the turn of the Common Era, Socotra was a crossroad of commerce based on the monsoon winds. This sea trade brought together people from the coasts of western Indian Ocean, Red Sea and East-Africa, as well as the Mediterranean. Socotra contributed to this sea trade with tortoise shells and resins of Myrrh, Frankincense and dragon tree, highly prized as fragrant incense and widely used in medicine and cosmetics.
But as per the fourth century, demand for the resins declined giving way to a cattle-breeding economy organized in pastoral tribes.

Written sources
In the late 2nd century BCE, Agatharchides recorded merchants from Potana, coming to the ""Blessed Islands"" (Socotra) to trade with Alexandrian merchants.
The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a first-century CE Greek navigation aid describes Socotra as follows:

The inhabitants, few in number, live on one side of the island, that to the north, the part facing the mainland; they are settlers, a mixture of Arabs and Indians and even some Greeks, who sail out of there to trade.
[The island was] subject to the King of the frankincense-bearing land [i.e. the Kingdom of Hadhramaut].
The Weilüe, a Chinese historical text written in the third century CE states:

The king of Zesan (Socotra) is subject to Da Qin (Rome). His seat of government is in the middle of the sea… [Zesan] is in close communication with Angu city (Gerrha) in Anxi (Parthia).

Petroglyph sites
The Eriosh Petroglyphs, located on the north coast 20 km south-west of the capital Hadibu, contain petroglyphs depicting figures of men, camels, foot symbology and crosses of uncertain dating.
In the outskirts of Suq 2.5 km west of Hadibu there is a petroglyph site containing cruciform ",history

Telecommunications in Guyana,"Telecommunications in Guyana include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Early telecommunications were owned by large foreign firms until the industry was nationalized in the 1970s. Government stifled criticism with a tight control of the media, and the infrastructure lagged behind other countries, Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Company (GT&T) holding a monopoly on most such  services. In a 2012 census report on Guyanese households, 55.5% had a radio, 82.7% had a television, 27.8% had a personal computer, and 16.2% had internet at home, 49.3% had a telephone landline, and  70.6% had a cellular phone. 
In the 1990s, a shift towards privatization was geared towards improving the overall quality of services in the country. The 2016 Telecommunications Act was made to improve quality and lower prices for consumers as well as establish universal access.

Infrastructure
Guyana has various communications cables for international connections. The Suriname-Guyana Submarine Cable System (SGSCS) linking Trinidad, Guyana, and Suriname and the Americas II fiber optic submarine communications cable linking the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Martinique, Curaçao, Trinidad, Venezuela, French Guiana, and Brazil with terrestrial extensions to Suriname and Guyana. The X-Link Submarine Cable was installed in 2019 and owned by E-Networks Inc., links Guyana to Barbados. An overland Brazil to Guyana Fibre Optic Cable that was built in 2011 has been abandoned due to extensive damage.

Radio
Radio history in Guyana started in the early 20th century, owing its early development to the country's interest in cricket. It was largely established by foreign media companies until a wave of nationalization mid-century. Currently there are stations aired that are privately owned, but the country has received much criticism for having tight government controls.

Television
Broadcast stations: government-dominated; the National Communications Network (NCN) TV is state-owned; a few private TV stations relay satellite services (2007).
Censorship: No government-imposed restrictions on television stations or suspensions of broadcasts in 2012. The government largely directs advertising to media houses aligned with the governing party. The government continues to exert heavy control over the content of the National Communications Network (TV), giving government spokespersons extended coverage, while limiting participation of opposition figures.

Closed-loop geothermal,"Closed-loop geothermal systems (also known as “advanced geothermal systems” or “AGS”) are a type of engineered geothermal energy system containing subsurface working fluid that is heated in a hot rock reservoir without direct contact with rock pores and fractures.: Instead, the subsurface working fluid stays inside a closed loop of deeply buried pipes that conduct Earth’s heat. Closed-loop geothermal systems are one of the prominent categories of next-generation geothermal systems in development today.

Like all geothermal systems, closed-loop geothermal systems provide renewable energy, and primarily operate as baseload resources that produce energy at a constant rate. Unlike conventional geothermal energy plants, closed-loop geothermal plants can be placed anywhere in the world, depending only on the depth of the hot rock resource.
Closed-loop geothermal projects are under development in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Germany.

Technology
Closed-loop geothermal companies use a wide variety of engineered systems to produce geothermal energy. These systems primarily vary based on the length and geometry of the closed-loop wells placed subsurface, but can also vary in the materials used in well construction and the working fluid used.
Two commons designs of closed-loop geothermal systems are the U-tube and the tube-in-tube:

U-tube closed-loop geothermal: In this system, cool water is pumped down one deep vertical pipe, which then extends horizontally for a certain distance at a depth where the rock is hot and then comes up in a different location. The horizontal section may be composed of one or multiple lateral (horizontal) well sections.
Tube-in-a-tube closed-loop geothermal: In this system, the cool water is pumped down along the outer layer of a pipe to a certain depth, at which point the pipe may extend an additional horizontal distance at that depth. When the hot water hits the end of the pipe it is pushed into the inner pipe, through which the hot water returns to the surface. Also called a coaxial or pipe-in-pipe system.

Research and development
Several closed-loop geothermal systems have been demonstrated globally. One commercial closed-loop geothermal project is under construction in Geretsried, Germany.

Advantages
The advantages of a deep, closed-loop geothermal circuit include

No need for a geofluid
No need for the hot rock to be permeable or porous
All the introduced working fluid can be recirculated with zero loss
No fracking or stimulation is required to establish the engineered geothermal reservoir.
These advantages mean closed-loop geothermal systems can be placed anywhere in the world as a source of carbon-free, baseload energy, with no impact to natural water resources and significantly reduced risk of induced seismicity.

Di Lampedusa strategy,"The di Lampedusa strategy or di Lampedusa principle (often misspelled de Lampedusa strategy) is a political doctrine that in order to maintain the status quo, one must accept change. It takes its name from the Italian novelist Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, who expressed the principle in his novel Il Gattopardo.

Definition
In the words of Judith Bessant,

The principle is that the best way to respond to seriously disruptive change threatening substantial political transformation is to make concessions to those who are posing it, to appease and diffuse political energies and emotions. In short, the di Lampedusa strategy involves placating, appropriating and incorporating the opposition in order to secure the older-prevailing system.

Origin
Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's novel The Leopard follows the family of its title character, the Sicilian nobleman Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina, through the events of the Risorgimento. In the story, Don Fabrizio's nephew, Tancredi, urges that Don Fabrizio should abandon his allegiance to the disintegrating Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and ally himself with Giuseppe Garibaldi and the House of Savoy. Tancredi says: ""Unless we ourselves take a hand now, they'll foist a republic on us. If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change"". The point-of-view character, Don Fabrizio, explicitly rejects this view, and despite the name ""di Lampedusa strategy"" there is little reason to think the author himself endorsed it.

Applied entomology,"Entomology (from Ancient Greek  ἔντομον (entomon) 'insect' and  -λογία (-logia) 'study') is the branch of zoology that focuses on insects. Those who study entomology are known as entomologists. In the past, the term insect was less specific, and historically the definition of entomology would also include the study of animals in other arthropod groups, such as arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. The field is also referred to as insectology in American English, while in British English insectology implies the study of the relationships between insects and humans.
Over 1.3 million insect species have been described by entomology.

History
Entomology is rooted in nearly all human cultures from prehistoric times, primarily in the context of agriculture (especially biological control and beekeeping). The natural Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) wrote a book on the kinds of insects, while the scientist of Kufa, Ibn al-A'rābī (760–845 CE) wrote a book on flies, Kitāb al-Dabāb (كتاب الذباب). However scientific study in the modern sense began only relatively recently, in the 16th century. Ulisse Aldrovandi's De Animalibus Insectis (Concerning Insect Animals) was published in 1602. Microscopist Jan Swammerdam published History of Insects, correctly describing the reproductive organs of insects and metamorphosis. In 1705, Maria Sibylla Merian published the book Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium about the tropical insects of Dutch Surinam.
Early entomological works associated with the naming and classification of species followed the practice of maintaining cabinets of curiosity, predominantly in Europe. This collecting fashion led to the formation of natural history societies, exhibitions of private collections, and journals for recording communications and the documentation of new species. Many of the collectors tended to be from the aristocracy, and there developed a trade involving collectors around the world and traders. This has been called the ""era of heroic entomology"". William Kirby is widely considered as the father of entomology in England. In collaboration with William Spence, he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, Introduction to Entomology, regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped found the Royal Entomological Society in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the Aurelian society date back to the 1740s. In the late 19th century, the growth of agriculture, and colonial trade spawned the ""era of economic entomology"" which created the professional entomologist associated with the rise of the university and training in the field of biology.
Entomology developed rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries and was studied by large numbers of people, including such notable figures as Charles Darwin, Jean-Henri Fabre, Vladimir Nabokov, Karl von Frisch (winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine), and twice Pulitzer Prize winner E.

Risk Management Agency,"The Risk Management Agency (RMA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which manages the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). The current Administrator is Heather Manzano in an acting capacity.

History
The Risk Management Agency (RMA) was created in 1996 by the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 to operate and manage the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC).
The FCIC was created in 1938, during the Great Depression, to provide insurance for farmers to allow them to profit from crop production even under difficult agricultural and economic circumstances. Many American farmers were forced to leave their farms as a result of the Dust Bowl during this period.

Programs, structure, staff, and budget
The Risk Management Agency (RMA) has three program areas: Insurance Services, which provides federal crop insurance to American farmers; Product Management, which develops and reviews crop insurance products to ensure actuarial soundness; and Compliance, which monitors federal crop insurance programs for fraud, waste, and abuse.
The RMA is managed by an Administrator appointed by the United States Secretary of Agriculture. The RMA Administrator serves as the non-voting manager of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Board.
The RMA employs Deputy Administrators to manage each of the three program areas, as well as a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, a Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and a Director of the Office of External Affairs. There are ten RMA regional offices around the country. The RMA employs more than 450 people in offices around the country.
The RMA had an operating budget of $74.8 million during Fiscal Year 2016, and managed more than $102 billion in insurance liability during 2015.

Touch rugby,"Touch rugby  refers to games derived from rugby league in which players do not tackle each other  but instead touch their opponents using their hands on any part of the body, clothing, or the ball.
A formal, competitive variety, known as  Touch, developed from rugby league and now exists as a sport in its own right. In addition, touch rugby games are played as training activities for rugby league and rugby union; as safer variants of rugby, particularly in schools and junior clubs, and as an informal social sport.

Features
Touch rugby has a number of differences from the traditional games, including its simplicity (it requires very little equipment or goalposts), its ease of learning, and the decreased likelihood of injury. As a result, it is a popular social game; mixed-gender and women-only games are also very popular in the UK, where Touch Rugby is played in many popular centres around England and Scotland. Touch Rugby League is a growing competition in Australia. Touch rugby is also gaining popularity in the United States. The USA Touch association hosts an annual national championship. In 2019, 27 clubs from cities across the USA registered teams into 6 competitive divisions. The sport is known as ""Touch"" in many parts of the world.
Beach touch is also popular. Social touch games in South Africa are played barefoot, while 1-touch or six down is played with cleats that have no more than 10 studs on each foot.
Since 1988, the Federation of International Touch has organized 9 World Cup championships. Typically, Australia and New Zealand have dominated as champions and runner-ups in each of the now 11 competitive divisions. Every 4 years, a member country is selected to host the tournament. In 2019, the World Cup was hosted in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and welcomed 28 participating nations. The 2024 FIT World Cup was hosted in Nottingham, England at the University of Nottingham. The 2024 FIT World Cup had 4,000 players from 39 nations competing in 187 teams across 13 categories. The 2028 FIT World Cup host country is New Zealand.

Rule variations
The most popular, codified form of touch rugby is derived from rugby league and features two teams of six players. Played under the auspices of the Federation of International Touch (FIT), it is officially known as Touch, and is also called touch football, particularly in Australia, and sometimes 'six down' or 'sixes' in South Africa. FIT rules have become the most common rules used both in FIT-sanctioned competitions and informal games of touch rugby. A version of the FIT rules known as one touch in South Africa features a change of possession after a single touch rather than the six in the league-derived game.
League tag is a semi-contact version of rugby league. It was used initially as a coaching aid to get players new to rugby league in Ireland used to the play-the-ball, retreating to an onside line, and upperbody tackling that stops the ball being passed in the tackle.

Science,"Science is a systematic discipline that builds and organises knowledge in the form of testable hypotheses and predictions about the universe. Modern science is typically divided into two or three major branches: the natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology), which study the physical world; and the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies. Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine. While sometimes referred to as the formal sciences, the study of logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science (which study formal systems governed by axioms and rules) are typically regarded as separate because they rely on deductive reasoning instead of the scientific method or empirical evidence as their main methodology. 
The history of science spans the majority of the historical record, with the earliest identifiable predecessors to modern science dating to the Bronze Age in Egypt and Mesopotamia (c. 3000–1200 BCE). Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped the Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes, while further advancements, including the introduction of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, were made during the Golden Age of India.: 12  Scientific research deteriorated in these regions after the fall of the Western Roman Empire during the Early Middle Ages (400–1000 CE), but in the Medieval renaissances (Carolingian Renaissance, Ottonian Renaissance and the Renaissance of the 12th century) scholarship flourished again. Some Greek manuscripts lost in Western Europe were preserved and expanded upon in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, along with the later efforts of Byzantine Greek scholars who brought Greek manuscripts from the dying Byzantine Empire to Western Europe at the start of the Renaissance.
The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th centuries revived natural philosophy, which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions. The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape, along with the changing of ""natural philosophy"" to ""natural science"".
New knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems. Contemporary scientific research is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and research institutions, government agencies, and companies. The practical impact of their work has led to the emergence of ",science

Wheelchair rugby,"Wheelchair rugby (originally murderball, and known as quad rugby in the United States) is a team sport for athletes with a disability.  It is practiced in over twenty-five countries around the world and is a summer Paralympic sport. in wheelchair rugby, players cannot kick the ball, so they move the ball forward towards the goal by carrying the ball in their lap. Type of ball: In traditional rugby, athletes play the game using a rugby ball; however, wheelchair rugby athletes use a rounder ball, like a volleyball to play the game.
The US name is based on the requirement that all wheelchair rugby players need to have disabilities that include at least some loss of function in at least three limbs. Although most have spinal cord injuries, players may also qualify through multiple amputations, neurological disorders or other medical conditions. Players are assigned a functional level in points, and each team is limited to fielding a team with a total of eight points.
Wheelchair rugby is played indoors on a hardwood court, and physical contact between wheelchairs is an integral part of the game. The rules include elements from wheelchair basketball, ice hockey, handball and rugby union.
The sport is governed by the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation (IWRF) which was established in 1993.

History
Wheelchair rugby was created to be a sport for persons with quadriplegia in 1976 by five Canadian wheelchair athletes, Gerry Terwin, Duncan Campbell, Randy Dueck, Paul LeJeune and Chris Sargent, in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
At that time, wheelchair basketball was the most common team sport for wheelchair users. That sport's physical requirement for players to dribble and shoot baskets relegated quadriplegic athletes, with functional impairments to both their upper limbs and lower limbs, to supporting roles.  The new sport—originally called murderball due to its aggressive, full-contact nature—was designed to allow quadriplegic athletes with a wide range of functional ability levels to play integral offensive and defensive roles.
Murderball was first introduced into Australia in 1982. The Australian team competing in the Stoke Mandeville games in England were invited by the Canadians to select a team to play them in a demonstration game. After receiving limited instructions on the rules and skills of the game the ""contest"" began. Following a fast and very competitive exchange, Australia won. The game was then born and brought back to Australia where it has flourished.
Murderball was introduced to the United States in 1979 by Brad Mikkelsen.  With the aid of the University of North Dakota's Disabled Student Services, he formed the first American team, the Wallbangers.  The first North American competition was held in 1982.
In the late 1980s, the name of the sport outside the United States was officially changed from Murderball to Wheelchair Rugby.  In the United States, the sport's name was changed to Quad Rugby.

Telecommunications in Kyrgyzstan,"Telecommunications in Kyrgyzstan include fixed and mobile telephones and the Internet.

Communications policy
The long-term goal of the government's information and communications technology strategy is for the telecommunications sector to contribute 5 percent to gross domestic product by 2010. The June 2006 launch of the KazSat communications satellite from Kazakhstan was expected to reduce the dependence of all the Central Asian countries on European and U.S. telecommunications satellites. Launch of a second KazSat is planned for 2009.

Telephones
In the early 2000s, Kyrgyzstan used international investment support to restructure its telecommunications system, which had 7.7 telephone lines per 100 inhabitants in 2002 and 1,100,000 cellular phones in use in 2007. As part of the upgrading process, the government has attempted to sell a majority interest in the state-owned telecommunications company, Kyrgyztelecom, to foreign bidders. Companies from Russia, Sweden, and Turkey have been possible buyers. However, in 2005 an estimated 100,000 applicants were waiting for telephone line installation.

Telephone system:
domestic: principally microwave radio relay; one cellular provider, probably limited to Bishkek region;
international: connections with other CIS countries by landline or microwave radio relay and with other countries by leased connections with Moscow international gateway switch and by satellite; satellite earth stations - 1 Intersputnik and 1 Intelsat; connected internationally by the Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) fiber-optic line.

Internet
In the early 2000s, Internet use has expanded rapidly. Between 1999 and 2005, the number of Internet subscribers increased from 3,000 to 263,000. In 2004 some 12,300 Internet hosts were in operation. The country code top level domain is .kg.
Variable upload/download speeds through xDSL are available through state telephone company Kyrgyz Telecom (up to 8 Mbit/s downlink) and private ISPs (up to 10 Mbit/s downlink). There is typically a monthly cap on the amount of data transferred, with separate caps depending on whether the data stays within Kyrgyzstan or travels beyond the border. Broadband internet access with unlimited international traffic is rarely offered by ISPs to the market at significantly higher price. This is probably due to the lack of country's telecommunications bandwidth capacity.
ISPs provide internet access through satellite backbone communication lines linked to Russia, Germany, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. There is a major telecommunications project under construction - The Trans-Asia-Europe Fiber Optic Line, connecting Shanghai, China and Frankfurt, Germany, with the capacity of 622 Mbit/s, where Kyrgyzstan has completed its part. Completion of this project might affect broadband internet prices in Kyrgyzstan.
There are several ISPs that provide broadband internet access using different technologies such as xDSL, ISDN, Leased Line, and Ethernet. ISPs in Kyrgyzstan include Kyrgyz Telecom",technology
Formal ontology,"In philosophy, the term formal ontology is used to refer to an ontology defined by axioms in a formal language with the goal to provide an unbiased (domain- and application-independent) view on reality, which can help the modeler of domain- or application-specific ontologies to avoid possibly erroneous ontological assumptions encountered in modeling large-scale ontologies.
By maintaining an independent view on reality, a formal (upper level) ontology gains the following properties:

indefinite expandability:
the ontology remains consistent with increasing content.
content and context independence:
any kind of 'concept' can find its place.
accommodate different levels of granularity.

Historical background
Theories on how to conceptualize reality date back as far as Plato and Aristotle. The term 'formal ontology' itself was coined by Edmund Husserl in the second edition of his Logical Investigations (1900–01), where it refers to an ontological counterpart of formal logic. Formal ontology for Husserl embraces an axiomatized mereology and a theory of dependence relations, for example between the qualities of an object and the object itself. 'Formal' signifies not the use of a formal-logical language, but rather: non-material, or in other words domain-independent (of universal application). Husserl's ideas on formal ontology were developed especially by his Polish student Roman Ingarden in his Controversy over the Existence of the World. The relations between the Husserlian tradition of formal ontology and the Polish tradition of mereology are set forth in Parts and Moments. Studies in Logic and Formal Ontology, edited by Barry Smith.

Common terms in formal (upper-level) ontologies
The differences in terminology used between separate formal upper-level ontologies can be quite substantial, but most formal upper-level ontologies apply one foremost dichotomy: that between endurants and perdurants.

Also known as continuants, or in some cases as ""substance"", endurants are those entities that can be observed-perceived as a complete concept, at no matter which given snapshot of time.
Were we to freeze time we would still be able to perceive/conceive the entire endurant.
Examples include material objects (such as an apple or a human), and abstract ""fiat"" objects (such as an organization, or the border of a country).

Temmler,"Temmler Werke GmbH was founded in Detmold in 1917 by Hermann Temmler. The Temmler Group is a German pharmaceutical company, which focuses on the production, sale and contract production of pharmaceutical products. In 2012, the Temmler Group was taken over by the Aenova Group and with its seven production sites is one of the largest European pharmaceutical contract manufacturers.

History
The Temmler-Werke was founded in Detmold in 1917 by Hermann Temmler. In 1919, it merged with the Vereinigte Chemische Fabriken GmbH in Detmold to form the Vereinigten Chemischen Fabriken H. Temmler pharmaceutical company. In 1925, its headquarters was re-located to Berlin. Preparations for the treatment and alleviation of respiratory diseases became the hallmark of Temmler Pharma.

From 1933, the company, with expanded production facilities, concentrated its business activities exclusively around the Berlin area. In 1938, a Temmler chemist in Berlin synthesised Pervitin (methamphetamine-hydrochloride), the pharmaceutical drug was then manufactured and dispensed over-the-counter to the public as a central nervous system and circulatory system analeptic, psychiatric performance enhancing stimulant and to induce or extend wakefulness to treat narcolepsy. Pervitin was made available and packaged in thirty tablet oral dosage form, and in six 1ccm glass ampulla form as an intramuscular or intravenous injectable. The company became especially known for the introduction of its methamphetamine-hydrochloride preparation brand Pervitin, which the company produced from 1938 up until 1988. 
According to a Der Spiegel article in 2005, Nazi Germany believed that Pervitin could also help win World War II, so the German armed forces was supplied with more than 35 million Pervitin tablets, especially during Germany's ""Blitzkrieg"" invasion of Poland and the Battle of France during 1939/40 where it was introduced to soldiers to attenuate anxiety and increase performance and concentration.
In 1945, the facility in East Berlin was occupied and disassembled. The company had to be completely reassembled in Hamburg. The company traded under the name Preuss & Temmler AG. The production facilities in East Berlin were sequestered and partially dismantled in 1945, placed under trusteeship from 1946 and expropriated in 1949.
In 1960, the whole company transferred from Hamburg to Marburg.
The Hessian state government awarded the complex, an area of about 40,000 m2 of production and administration facilities, a prize for functional and architectural design.
In 1967, the production and storage facilities were extended.
In 1971, a new laboratory building was erected for the manufacture of pharmaceutical dosage forms and active ingredients for controlled release. It became possible, for example, to produce medicinal products in the form of retard pellets releasing their active ingredients when required and over a longer period of time.
In 1982, these retard preparations marked the beginning of con",medicine
Radio-electronic industry in Ukraine,"Radio-electronic industry is a part of the machine-building industry, which in planning has been classified since 1968 separately from the radio industry, electronic industry, and the subdivision of instrument making. In the official reporting statistics license applications are submitted only in the categories of ""devices, means of automation and computer technology"" and ""radio receivers, radios, TVs and household recorders"", which does not cover all products. 
By methods of calculating national income, radio-electronic industry in 1969 gave the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic around 1.9% of the products of all aggression. In reality, it was likely more than this. The radio-electronic industry rarely produces finished products; as most of its products are components of others. The end products, as well as the parts, and the semi-finished products went into the following: rockets, artificial satellites, nuclear power plants, etc. An important component of their products, polymer batteries require many strategically important and scarce metals, plastics, minerals, and synthetics. Because of this, they are closely connected with many other industries. 
According to the organization of production, technology and communications to the  mining industry, the following branches of industry are fully or  at least partly involved: radio engineering, telephone and telegraph, the industry of special (largely military) radio and radio navigation equipment, cybernetic, electronic computing and guiding machines (computers) and electronic automation equipment. This is an industry that manufactures electronic machines for boot control of production processes, office work, control and accounting, planning and commercial and financial operations, machines for school education, for photographic reproduction of documents, storage, and finding of information. Further in the industry of measuring equipment is the electronic vacuum, technological equipment, conductors, radio components, materials for radio-electronic industry (produces electrical engineering, glass, special ceramics, pie, mica, luminophore, etc.) and special engineering for the radio-electronic industry.

Radio-electronic industry in Ukraine
In Ukraine, the radio-electronic industry is a subject that is only relevant to union ministries. It is the youngest branch of the industry both in Ukraine and in the world, but its significance is huge, and will soon be decisive for the entire national economy in the near future because the electronics industry becomes the core of all machine building. In radio-electronic industry, the beginnings of agricultural production were in 1896, when in the Sumy the Belgians built machine-building workshops, which were made among others, telephone and telegraph devices. The first radiotelegraph laboratory was opened in Kyiv by S. Eisenstein in 1905, the first radio station was built in Mylokaiv in 1914.

Robot control,"Robotic control is the system that contributes to the movement of robots. This involves the mechanical aspects and programmable systems that makes it possible to control robots. Robotics can be controlled by various means including manual, wireless, semi-autonomous (a mix of fully automatic and wireless control), and fully autonomous (using artificial intelligence).

Modern robots (2000-present)
Medical and surgical
In the medical field, robots are used to make precise movements that are difficult for humans. Robotic surgery involves the use of less-invasive surgical methods, which are “procedures performed through tiny incisions”. Robots use the da Vinci surgical method, which involves the robotic arm (which holds onto surgical instruments) and a camera. The surgeon sits on a console where he controls the robot wirelessly. The feed from the camera is projected on a monitor, allowing the surgeon to see the incisions. The system is built to mimic the movement of the surgeon’s hands and has the ability to filter slight hand tremors. But despite the visual feedback, there is no physical feedback. In other words, as the surgeon applies force on the console, the surgeon won’t be able to feel how much pressure he or she is applying to the tissue.

Military
The earliest robots used in the military dates back to the 19th century, where automatic weapons were on the rise due to developments in mass production. The first automated weapons were used in World War I, including radio-controlled, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Since the invention, the technology of ground and aerial robotic weapons continues to develop, it transitioned to become part of modern warfare. In the transition phase of the development, the robots were semi-automatic, being able to be controlled remotely by a human controller. The advancements made in sensors and processors lead to advancements in capabilities of military robots. Since the mid-20th century, the technology of artificial intelligence (A.I.) began to develop and in the 21st century, the technology transferred to warfare, and the weapons that were semi-automatous is developing to become lethal autonomous weapons systems, LAWS for short.

Impact
As the weapons are being developed to become fully autonomous, there is an ambiguous line of what is the line that separates an enemy to a civilian. There is currently a debate of whether or not artificial intelligence is able to differentiate these enemies and the question of what is morally and humanely right (for example, a child unknowingly working for the enemies).

Space exploration
Space missions involve sending robots into space in the goal of discovering more of the unknown. The robots used in space exploration have been controlled semi-autonomously. The robots that are sent to space have the ability to maneuver itself, and are self-sustaining. To allow for data collection and a controlled research, the robot is always in communications with scientists and engineers on Ea",technology
Social relation,"A social relation is the fundamental unit of analysis within the social sciences, and describes any voluntary or involuntary interpersonal relationship between two or more conspecifics within and/or between groups. The group can be a language or kinship group, a social institution or organization, an economic class, a nation, or gender. Social relations are derived from human behavioral ecology, and, as an aggregate, form a coherent social structure whose constituent parts are best understood relative to each other and to the social ecosystem as a whole.

History
Early inquiries into the nature of social relations featured in the work of sociologists such as Max Weber in his theory of social action, where social relationships composed of both positive (affiliative) and negative (agonistic) interactions represented opposing effects. Categorizing social interactions enables observational and other social research, such as Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft (lit. 'community and society'), collective consciousness, etc.
Ancient works which include manuals of good practice in social relations include the text of Pseudo-Phocylides, 175–227, Josephus' polemical work Against Apion, 198–210, and the deutero-canonical Jewish Book of Sirach or Ecclesiasticus, 7:18–36.
More recent research on social behaviour has demonstrated that newborn infants tend to instinctually gravitate towards prosocial behaviour. As obligate social apes, humans are born highly altricial, and require an extended period of post-natal development for cultural transmission of social organization, language, and moral frameworks. In linguistic and anthropological frameworks, this is reflected in a culture's kinship terminology, with the default mother-child relation emerging as part of the embryological process.

Forms of relation and interaction
According to Piotr Sztompka, forms of relation and interaction in sociology and anthropology may be described as follows: first and most basic are animal-like behaviors, i.e. various physical movements of the body. Then there are actions—movements with a meaning and purpose. Then there are social behaviors, or social actions, which address (directly or indirectly) other people, which solicit a response from another agent.
Next are social contacts, a pair of social actions, which form the beginning of social interactions which metadata is a big contribution.Symbols define social relationships. Without symbols, our social life would be no more sophisticated than that of animals. For example, without symbols, people would have no aunts or uncles, employers or teachers—or even brothers and sisters. In sum, symbolic interactionists analyze how social life depends on the ways people define themselves and others. They study face-to-face interaction, examining how people make sense of life and how they determine their relationships.

Charles V. Dyer,"Charles Volney Dyer (June 12, 1808 – April 24, 1878) was a prominent Chicago abolitionist and Stationmaster on the Underground Railroad.

Early life
Charles was born in Clarendon, Vermont on June 12, 1808, the ninth of the ten children of Daniel and Susannah Olin Dyer. A precocious child, he was sent at age 15 to the Castleton Academy to prepare for college.  He then attended Middlebury College's medical department, from which he graduated on December 9, 1830.
He established a practice in Newark, Wayne County Vermont in February 1831.

Chicago years
Ambition led him to Chicago, then a small, but rapidly growing town, in August 1835.  He became Surgeon for the garrison at Ft. Dearborn soon thereafter. In 1837, he married Louisa M. Gifford, of Elgin, with whom he would have six children, three of whom (Stella Louisa, Charles Gifford and Louis) would survive into adulthood. The Dyers also adopted a daughter, Cornelia. Dyer was elected town clerk of Chicago in the Juny 6, 1836 town election (held at the Tremont House), but resigned immediately after being elected.
Reentering private practice, he was instrumental in the fight against the cholera that plagued Chicago in the late 1840s.  In 1839, he shared offices with Dr. Levi D. Boone, who would go on to become mayor of Chicago in 1855. 
Dyer invested his savings in real estate, and after several ups and downs, was able to retire from the practice of medicine in 1854.

Abolition activities
In 1837, Dr. Dyer rented a hall and called a protest meeting in reaction to the murder of Elijah Lovejoy by a mob in Alton, Illinois. In 1838, he helped organize a Chicago Chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society, along with Rev. Flavel Bascom, Philo Carpenter, Robert Freeman, L.C.P. Freer, and Calvin DeWolf.
In 1839, Dyer took in a runaway slave boy, and arranged for his passage on to Windsor, Canada, thus beginning his career as a stationmaster on the Underground Railroad. From then on, he would host many runaways, evading the Illinois law against ""harboring"" (fraudulently concealing) runaways by allowing them to live openly in his home while waiting for passage to Canada. One prominent conductor on the Underground Railroad, Owen Lovejoy, is known to have taken many runaway slaves to Dr. Dyer's home, and was frequently a guest there himself.
Dyer was not merely a passive host, he was also known to take action to rescue runaways who were retrieved by slave-catchers. Slave-catchers from Kentucky, knowing that Dr. Dyer was harboring a young male slave they were after, waited for the boy to leave Dr. Dyer's house on an errand.  Snatching him, they took him to a hotel and bound him with rope, sending for a blacksmith to fit him with iron manacles.  Hearing about this, Dyer went to the hotel, burst into the room where the captive was held, and cut the ropes, directing him to escape through a window.
Once the slave catchers recovered from their surprise at this bold action, they chased Dr. Dyer out into the street, a",medicine
Jamu,"Jamu (Javanese: ꦗꦩꦸ) is a traditional medicine from Indonesia. It is predominantly a herbal medicine made from natural materials, such as roots, bark, flowers, seeds, leaves and fruits. Materials acquired from animals, such as honey, royal jelly, milk and native chicken eggs are often used as well.
In 2019, Jamu was officially recognized as one of Indonesia's intangible cultural heritage by the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture. Subsequently in December 2023 Jamu wellness culture is officially recognized as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia.
Jamu can be found throughout Indonesia; however, it is most prevalent in Java, where Mbok Jamu, the traditional kain kebaya-wearing young to middle-aged Javanese woman carrying bamboo basket, filled with bottles of jamu on her back, travelling villages and towns alleys, offering her fares of traditional herbal medicine, can be found. In many large cities jamu herbal medicine is sold on the street by hawkers carry a refreshing drink, usually bitter but sweetened with honey or palm sugar.
Herbal medicine is also produced in factories by large companies such as Air Mancur, Djamu Djago or Sido Muncul, and sold at various drug stores in sachet packaging. Packaged dried jamu should be dissolved in hot water first before drinking. Nowadays herbal medicine is also sold in the form of tablets, caplets and capsules. These jamu brands are united in an Indonesian Herbal and Traditional Medicine Association, locally known as Gabungan Pengusaha Jamu (GP Jamu). Today, jamu is a growing local herbal medicine industry worth millions of dollars. In 2014, jamu contributed Rp 3 trillion (US$73.29 million) to overall sales.

Etymology
The word jamu is of Javanese origin. It derives from the Javanese words jawa (ꦗꦮ, ""Javanese"" or ""Java""), and ngramu (ꦔꦿꦩꦸ, ""mixing"" or ""gathering"" (the ingredients)). It roughly translates to ""concoction made by the Javanese"" or ""concoction originating from Java"".
Another theory suggests that the word jamu is derived from the ancient Javanese term jampi (Aksara Jawa: ꦗꦩ꧀ꦥꦶ, ""magic formula""), referring to the mantras cast by dukuns (the indigenous shamans) to the potion. It is also believed that jamu was initially used by dukuns as one of the spiritual requirements for black magic practices.

Traditional production centers
Despite jamu's popularity throughout Indonesia, it seems that jamu culture is most prevalent in Java. The jamu herbal culture is prevalent in Javanese royal courts of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, where the ancient books on herbal medicine is kept in royal library, and jamu medicine is prescribes to royalties and nobles in Javanese keratons. According to Javanese tradition, the famed beauty of putri keraton (princess and palace ladies) are owed to jamu and lulur (traditional lotion).
Sukoharjo in Central Java in particular is believed to be one of the center of jamu tradition. Many of the Mbok Jamu jamu sellers ladies are hailed from this town. The traditional",medicine
Direct labor cost,"Direct labor cost is a part of wage-bill or payroll that can be specifically and consistently assigned to or associated with the manufacture of a product, a particular work order, or provision of a service. Also, we can say it is the cost of the work done by those workers who actually make the product on the production line.

Determination of the direct labor cost
Planning the work to be performed.
Describing the job content of the work, by indicating the skill, knowledge, etc.
Matching the jobs with the employees.

Usage
The direct labor cost is part of the manufacturing cost.

Calculation of direct labor cost
In the direct labor cost we need to have the job time and wage we will pay it to the worker to calculate the direct labor cost as in this formulation:-

  
    
      
        
          Direct labor cost
        
        =
        
          job time
        
        ×
        
          wage
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{Direct labor cost}}={\text{job time}}\times {\text{wage}}}
  

Depending on the context, there are various methods to calculate personnel costs, such as on an hourly or daily basis.

Wage
The wage is the payment rendered to the worker per hour as a compensation for the work done.

Calculating job time
The job time needs to be measured by one of the following ways:

time study
work sampling

History of Jessore,"The Greater Jessore district region predominantly includes the modern districts of Jessore, Jhenaidah, Narail and Magura in Bangladesh, as well as the Bangaon subdivision of India. Nestled close to the Sundarbans, the region experienced human settlement early on. It served as the capital city of the Samatata realm and passed through several Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms such as the Palas and Senas. Jessore was ruled by Khan Jahan Ali of Khalifatabad, under the Muslim Sultanate of Bengal, who is credited with establishing the Qasbah of Murali and urbanising the region through advancements in transportation and civilization. Jessore later came to be ruled by various kings
such as Pratapaditya and became familiar to contemporary European travellers as Chandecan before being annexed to the Mughal Empire in the seventeenth century. By 1757, the British East India Company had dominated and started to establish themselves in the region. British rule lasted up until 1947, with Jessore coming under the Provisional Government of Bangladesh from 1971 onwards.

Ancient
It is thought that Jessore was a sparsely populated fenland in ancient times, being situated between the Suhma kingdom and the Vanga kingdom. Ruins of an ancient temple dating back to the 2nd century have been discovered in Donar, Manirampur. By the fifth century, the Jessore region came under the control of the Vanga kingdom. Alexander Cunningham suggests that Jessore was the capital of the Buddhist Samatata kingdom, which Xuanzang of Tang China visited in the 630s and mentioned in his book, the Great Tang Records on the Western Regions. It is said that Vanga lost control of Jessore after the invasion of King Jessobarman of Kannauj. Jessore then successively came under the rule of the Palas and Senas.

Medieval
A caravan of 25 Muslim preachers were said to have arrived in the greater Jessore region following the Umayyad conquest of Sindh in 711 AD, developing a small minority community in the area. In the following centuries, a further ten large caravans of ghazis predominantly from the Arabian Peninsula permanently settled in the regions of Jessore, Khulna and the 24 Parganas. Notable personalities among this later group include Gazi Pir, Zayed Ghazi, Ahmad Ghazi, Hussaini Ghazi, Muhammad Ghazi, Mawdud Ghazi, Mubashar Ghazi, Momin Ghazi, Amjad Ghazi, Sahib Ghazi, Abdullah and Sanaullah Rana-Ghazi. Four of these ghazis established the village of Dariapur in Sreepur, Magura as their hub. The settlement of these Muslim populations influenced local Buddhists and Hindus to convert to Islam.
Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji's conquest of Bengal in 1202 formally established Muslim rule in the region. During the early 14th-century, Bengal was divided between three small divisions- Sonargaon in the east, Lakhnauti in the west, and Satgaon in the south. Izzuddin Yahya was appointed by Muhammad bin Tughluq as the governor of southern Bengal and he encouraged conversion to Islam among the Buddhist and Hindu popu",history
Elizabethan era,"The Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor period of the history of England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603). Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history. The Roman symbol of Britannia (a female personification of Great Britain) was revived in 1572, and often thereafter, to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over Spain.
This ""golden age"" represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for its theatre, as William Shakespeare and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the Protestant Reformation became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the Spanish Armada was repelled. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.
The Elizabethan age contrasts sharply with the previous and following reigns. It was a brief period of internal peace between the Wars of the Roses in the previous century, the English Reformation, and the religious battles between Protestants and Catholics prior to Elizabeth's reign, and then the later conflict of the English Civil War and the ongoing political battles between parliament and the monarchy that engulfed the remainder of the seventeenth century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.
England was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. The Italian Renaissance had come to an end following the end of the Italian Wars, which left the Italian Peninsula impoverished. The Kingdom of France was embroiled in the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598). They were (temporarily) settled in 1598 by a policy of tolerating Protestantism with the Edict of Nantes. In part because of this, but also because the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent by Spain's tercios, the centuries-long Anglo-French Wars were largely suspended for most of Elizabeth's reign.
The one great rival was Habsburg Spain, with whom England clashed both in Europe and the Americas in skirmishes that exploded into the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604. An attempt by Philip II of Spain to invade England with the Spanish Armada in 1588 was famously defeated.
England during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government, largely a result of the reforms of Henry VII and Henry VIII, as well as Elizabeth's harsh punishments for any dissenters. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of trans-Atlantic trade and persistent theft of Spanish and Portuguese treasures, most notably as a result of Francis Drake's circumnavigation.

Classical antiquity,"Classical antiquity, also known as the classical era, classical period, classical age, or simply antiquity, is the period of cultural European history between the 8th century BC and the 5th century AD comprising the interwoven civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome known together as the Greco-Roman world, centered on the Mediterranean Basin. It is the period during which ancient Greece and ancient Rome flourished and had major influence throughout much of Europe, North Africa, and West Asia.
Conventionally, it is often considered to begin with the earliest recorded Epic Greek poetry of Homer (8th–7th centuries BC) and end with the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. Such a wide span of history and territory covers many disparate cultures and periods. Classical antiquity may also refer to an idealized vision among later people of what was, in Edgar Allan Poe's words, ""the glory that was Greece, and the grandeur that was Rome"".
The culture of the ancient Greeks, together with some influences from the ancient Near East, was the basis of art, philosophy, society, and education in the Mediterranean and Near East until the Roman imperial period. The Romans preserved, imitated, and spread this culture throughout Europe, until they were able to compete with it. This Greco-Roman cultural foundation has been immensely influential on the language, politics, law, educational systems, philosophy, science, warfare, literature, historiography, ethics, rhetoric, art and architecture of both the Western, and through it, the modern world.
Surviving fragments of classical culture helped produce a revival beginning during the 14th century which later came to be known as the Renaissance, and various neo-classical revivals occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries.

History
Archaic period (c. 8th to c. 6th centuries BC)
The earliest period of classical antiquity occurs during a time of gradual resurgence of historical sources after the Late Bronze Age collapse. The 8th and 7th centuries BC are still largely protohistorical, with the earliest Greek alphabetic inscriptions appearing during the first half of the 8th century. The legendary poet Homer is usually assumed to have lived during the 8th or 7th century BC, and his lifetime is often considered as the beginning of classical antiquity. During the same period is the traditional date for the establishment of the Ancient Olympic Games, in 776 BC.

Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Assyrians
The Phoenicians originally expanded from ports in Canaan, by the 8th century dominating trade in the Mediterranean. Carthage was founded in 814 BC, and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had established strongholds in Sicily, Italy and Sardinia, which created conflicts of interest with Etruria. A stele found in Kition, Cyprus,  commemorates the victory of King Sargon II in 709 BC over the seven kings of the island, marking an important part of the transfer of Cyprus from Tyrian rule to the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

American Osler Society,"The American Osler Society is an organisation dedicated to the history of medicine and focuses on the ""life, teachings, and ethical example of Sir William Osler"". It works in co-operation with the Osler Library of the History of Medicine at McGill University and consists of a group of physicians, medical historians, and other related professions united by ""the common purpose of keeping alive the memory of Sir William Osler"".
The society publishes a newsletter, The Oslerian.

Origins
John P. McGovern, from Houston, Texas, and Alfred Henderson from Washington, were concerned over the perceived lessening humane effect of science on medical education and the increasing threat of technology. Together with Chester R. Burns they formed the American Osler Society in 1970. William B. Bean became the first president, George Harrell the first vice-president, followed by Tom Durant as second vice-president. McGovern became the first secretary and the position of ""historian"" was created in 2000.
The statement of purpose;

The purpose of the Society is to unite, into an organized group, physicians, and others allied to the profession, with a common interest in memorializing and perpetuating the lessons of the life and teachings of William Osler; to meet periodically for the purpose of presentation and discussion ofpapers on the life and influence of Osler upon the profession, and to publish these essays as a Proceedings of the Society; to continually place before the profession a reminder of the high principles of life and humanism in practice of Osler, and to introduce these things to those entering the profession.
Osler's Oxford students, Wilburt C. Davison, Emile Holman, and Wilder Penfield, were named the three Honorary Members.

Logo
A latchkey represents the logo of the society. A number of junior medical staff were given the keys to Osler's home library in Baltimore, by Osler himself. These favoured staff members who included Harvey Cushing, became known as ""latch-keyers"".

Activities
The society works in co-operation with the Osler Library of the History of Medicine at McGill University and consists of a group of physicians, medical historians, and other related professions united by the aim of keeping Osler's memory. The society meets annually each spring.
Between 1970 and 2007, the society had witnessed over 700 presentations, of which about half have been centred around Osler's personal and professional life.
In May 2003, the American Osler Society, the Osler Club of London and the Japanese Osler Society came together in Edinburgh.

Publications
Selected presentations have been published as the persisting Osler in the quarterly The Oslerian.

Kinesiology,"Kinesiology (from Ancient Greek  κίνησις (kínēsis) 'movement' and  -λογία -logía 'study of') is the scientific study of human body movement. Kinesiology addresses physiological, anatomical, biomechanical, pathological, neuropsychological principles and mechanisms of movement. Applications of kinesiology to human health include biomechanics and orthopedics; strength and conditioning; sport psychology; motor control; skill acquisition and motor learning; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise physiology. Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, electrophysiology of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.

Basics
Kinesiology studies the science of human movement, performance, and function by applying the fundamental sciences of cell biology, molecular biology, chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, biomechanics, biomathematics, biostatistics, anatomy, physiology, exercise physiology, pathophysiology, neuroscience, and nutritional science. A bachelor's degree in kinesiology can provide strong preparation for graduate study in medical school, biomedical research, as well as in professional programs.
The term ""kinesiologist"" is not a licensed nor professional designation in many countries, with the notable exception of Canada. Individuals with training in this area can teach physical education, work as personal trainers and sports coaches, provide consulting services, conduct research and develop policies related to rehabilitation, human motor performance, ergonomics, and occupational health and safety. In North America, kinesiologists may study to earn a Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, or Doctorate of Philosophy degree in Kinesiology or a Bachelor of Kinesiology degree, while in Australia or New Zealand, they are often conferred an Applied Science (Human Movement) degree (or higher). Many doctoral-level faculty in North American kinesiology programs received their doctoral training in related disciplines, such as neuroscience, mechanical engineering, psychology, and physiology.
In 1965, the University of Massachusetts Amherst created the United States' first Department of Exercise Science (kinesiology) under the leadership of visionary researchers and academicians in the field of exercise science. In 1967, the University of Waterloo launched Canada's first kinesiology department.

Principles
Adaptation through exercise
Adaptation through exercise is a key principle of kinesiology that relates to improved fitness in athletes as well as health and wellness in clinical populations. Exercise is a simple and established intervention for many movement disorders and musculoskeletal conditions due to the neuroplasticity of the brain and the adaptability of the musculoskeletal system.

Go back to where you came from,"""Go back to where you came from"" is a racist or xenophobic epithet which is used in many countries, and it is mainly used to target actual immigrants and falsely presumed immigrants.
In contemporary United States, it is directed often at Asian and Hispanic Americans, and sometimes African, Arab, Jewish, and Slavic Americans. It has even been directed towards Indigenous Americans in the US. There is also a common variant of the phrase that has been popularized by the Ku Klux Klan: ""Go back to your country."" It was originally used in the US by White Anglo-Saxon Protestants and targeted at other European immigrants, such as Irish, Italians, Poles, and Jews.
The phrase was popularized during World War I and World War II in relation to German Americans, who were subject to suspicion, discrimination, and violence. The term is often accompanied with an erroneous assumption of the target's origin; for example, Hispanic and Latino Americans may be told to ""Go back to Mexico"" even if they aren't Mexican. The message conveys a sense that the person is ""not supposed to be there, or that it isn't their place."" The speaker is presumed to be a ""real"" American, but the target of the remark is not.
Such phrases are deemed by the United States federal government and the court system to be discriminatory in the workplace. Their use has been accepted as evidence of workplace discrimination in cases brought before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a federal government agency that ""enforces federal law to make sure employees are not discriminated against for their gender, sex, national origin or age."" EEOC documents specifically cite the use of the comment ""Go back to where you came from,"" as the example of unlawful workplace conduct by co-workers and supervisors, along with the use of ""insults, taunting, or ethnic epithets, such as making fun of a person's accent,"" deemed to be ""harassment based on national origin.""

Background
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is a federal government agency that ""enforces federal law to make sure employees are not discriminated against for their gender, sex, national origin or age"".
EEOC documents defining ""harassment based on national origin"" specifically cite the use of the comment ""Go back to where you came from"", as the example of ""unlawful"" workplace conduct by co-workers and supervisors if its use is creates an ""intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, interfere[s] with work performance, or negatively affect[s] job opportunities"". Other ""illegal"" workplace behavior includes the use of ""insults, taunting, or ethnic epithets, such as making fun of a person's accent"".
According to a July 20, 2019, CNN article, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has used phrases, such as, ""Go back to where you came from"" as evidence of workplace discrimination.

Home Ball,"Home Ball is a combination of three sports practices involving balls in a closed and target-equipped facility created in 2011. In each of these practices (Home Ball Handball, Home Ball Football and Home Ball Wheelchair), two teams compete against each other to score in the yellow targets of the opposing side in order to get more points than their opponent.
These emerging sports are aimed at a wide audience ranging from young people to seniors. The equipment is closed with the surface of the field relatively restricted.

History
Home Ball was created in 2011 by Dominique Desbouillons, an inhabitant from the village of La Haye-Pesnel, France, based on an idea initially developed at his home for two years. It initially gave birth to two sports practices: the Home Ball Handball and the Home Ball Football. It was only a few years later that the practice of the Home Ball Wheelchair appeared.
Since then, Home Ball sports are practiced in all places, such as campsites, leisure parks, indoor and outdoor sports complexes and schools. Clubs began to emerge in France, competions organised and a federation was created.

Equipment
Home ball equipment is a net-enclosed terrain with two camps each having five targets (four yellow targets, one red target). The number of players in each team depends on the size of the Home Ball field used and the practice chosen. There are three dimensions of terrain : 4.50 x 4.50 m, 6.50 x 6.50 m, 8.50 x 8.50 m.
The official Home Ball balls used have been specially designed for practice.

The three sports
Home Ball Handball
Home Ball Handball is inspired by handball, in which two teams compete with the objective of scoring more points than their opponents. The practice is played 2-on-2 in a field 4.50 x 4.50 m, 3-on-3 in a field 6.50 x 6.50 m and 4-on-4 in a field 8.50 x 8.50 m. Touching the ball with the foot is prohibited.

Home Ball Football
Home Ball Football is a sport inspired by football, in which two teams compete on foot with the goal of scoring more points than their opponents. The practice is played 1-on-1 in a field 4.50 x 4.50 m, 2-on-2 in a field 6.50 x 6.50 m and 3-on-3 in a field 8.50 x 8.50 m. The use of the ball by hand is prohibited.

Home Ball Wheelchair
The sport of the Home Ball Hand Armchair is inspired by handi basketball in which two teams compete with the objective to score more points than their opponent. The practice is 1:1 on a 4.50 x 4.50m, 2:2 on a 6.50 x 6.50m and 3:3 on an 8.50 x 8.50m. It is only played in wheelchairs to allow both the able-bodied and disabled people to practise together.

Democratic transition,"A democratic transition describes a phase in a country's political system as a result of an ongoing change from an authoritarian regime to a democratic one. The process is known as democratisation, political changes moving in a democratic direction. Democratization waves have been linked to sudden shifts in the distribution of power among the great powers, which created openings and incentives to introduce sweeping domestic reforms. Although transitional regimes experience more civil unrest, they may be considered stable in a transitional phase for decades at a time. Since the end of the Cold War transitional regimes have become the most common form of government. Scholarly analysis of the decorative nature of democratic institutions  concludes that the opposite  democratic backsliding (autocratization), a transition to authoritarianism is the most prevalent basis of modern hybrid regimes.

Glossary of anarchism,"The following is a list of terms specific to anarchists. Anarchism is a political and social movement which advocates voluntary association in opposition to authoritarianism and hierarchy.

A
Acracy
The negation of rule or ""government by none"". While ""anarchy"" refers to the absence of a hierarchical society-organizing power principle, ""acracy"" refers to the absence of coercion; the condition of acracy is one of voluntary order. Derived from the Greek α- [no] and κρατία [system of government].
Adhocracy
A form of organic organization according to which different parts of an organization are temporarily assembled to meet the requirements of that particular point in time.
Affinity group
A small non-hierarchical collective of individuals who collaborate on direct action via consensus decision-making.
Anarch
Coined by Ernst Jünger, this refers to the ruler (i.e. individual) in a state of anarchy analogous to the monarch in a state of monarchy, a conception influenced by Max Stirner's notion of the sovereign individual.
Anarchism without adjectives
A form of anarchism which does not declare affiliation with any specific subtype of anarchism (as may be suffixed to anarcho- or anarcha-), instead positioning itself as pluralistic, tolerant of all anarchist schools of thought.
Anarchy
Derived from the Ancient Greek ἀν (without) + ἄρχειν (to rule) ""without archons,"" ""without rulers"".
Anomie
Social disorder and civil war in an absence of government, used to separate anarchy as in social order and absence of government.
Ansoc
Clipping of anarcho-socialism and/or anarcho-socialist used in informal discourse, particularly in blogs or other internet forums.
Anti-systemic library
A library which is not organised hierarchically and that has no catalogue. The concept is influenced by the ideas of the Situationists.
Autonomism
A set of radical left-wing political movements in Western Europe which emerged in the late 20th century.
Archon
A Greek word meaning ""ruler""; the absence of archons and archy (rule) defines a state of anarchy. Derived from the Ancient Greek άρχων, pl. άρχοντες.

B
Biennio rosso
The ""two red years"" of political agitation, strikes and land occupation by Italian workers in 1919 and 1920.
Black anarchism
A political philosophy primarily of African-Americans, opposed to what it sees as the oppression of people of colour by the white ruling class through the power of the state.
Black bloc
An affinity group, or cluster of affinity groups that assembles during protests, demonstrations, or other forms of direct action. Black blocs are noted for the distinctive all-black clothing worn by members to conceal their identity and for their intentional defiance of state property law.
Bourse du Travail
A distinctively French form of working class organization of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, bourses du travail promoted mutual aid, education, and self-organization amongst their members.

Consensus decision-making
A participatory decision ",politics
Scienticide,"Scienticide is a concept used to refer to various multifaceted processes or phenomena that lead to the harassment, reduction, or outright destruction of scientific and technological systems in some countries of the world, as well as the exile or abandonment of researchers from their places of training. These can occur for various reasons, such as wars, political repression, lack of opportunities, climate crises, foreign interventions, economic policies, or ideological persecution.

Etymology
The term metaphorically refers to the ""murder of science,"" as it combines the word *science* with the Latin suffix - *cidium*, which comes from the root *caedĕre* (""to kill""). A comparative use of the term has been proposed alongside ""femicide"", as part of policies aimed at eliminating the scientific and technological systems of a country.

History
The first references to this concept using the English word ""scienticide"" date back to the 1990s when it was used to refer to the destruction of the network of educational, scientific, and research institutions created by the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia between 1942 and 1945. The educational system established was systematically attacked by the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland, commonly known as *Chetniks*, a nationalist, conservative, and Serbian monarchist guerrilla organization. This harassment was referred to as a true scienticide. The term was also used to describe the persecution, murder, or imprisonment in concentration camps of many genetic scientists—such as Nikolai Vavilov— by the former Soviet Union during the 1930s and 1940s.
Years later, this term was used in Portuguese in 2014 to criticize government policies in Portugal related to cuts of 82 million euros from science, driven by then Minister of Education and Science, which was labeled ""scienticide"" by the opposition.
In Spanish, the concept gained relevance when it began to be formulated and extensively used within Argentine academic circles to refer to and oppose budget cuts and their negative effects on the scientific-technological system that occurred starting in 2016 during Mauricio Macri's government. Thus, during these years, several publications emerged; the first within a free chair at a national university, in newspapers, academic books, and scientific publications. During this period, the concept and word were used as a slogan by those affected by these policies. Subsequently, its use expanded to encompass both loss of sovereignty and neoliberal policies in Latin America, as well as what is commonly referred to as ""infocognitive extractivism"" of highly qualified scientific personnel by first-world scientific centers, linking it to what is commonly known as ""brain drain"". A similar process occurred in Brazil during these years when it was described as ""scienticides"".
At an international level, the term was not significantly used until the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which significantly affec",science
Afghanistanism,"Afghanistanism is a term, first recorded in the United States, for the practice of concentrating on problems in distant parts of the world while ignoring controversial local issues. In other contexts, the term has referred to ""hopelessly arcane and irrelevant scholarship"",
""fascination with exotic, faraway lands"", or ""Railing and shaking your fist at an unseen foe who is quite unaware of your existence, much less your fury"".

Origin
The Oxford English Dictionary lists Afghanistanism as a U.S. colloquialism; the first written citation it provides is from 1948: J. Lloyd Jones in Probl. Journalism (American Society of Newspaper Editors Convention) 73, ""I don't wish to belabor this subject of Afghanistanism, this business of taking forthright stands on elections in Costa Rica, while the uncollected local garbage reeks beneath the editor's window.""
Robert H. Stopher and James S. Jackson, writing in their April 1948 column ""Behind the Front Page"", said the ""new term"" was coined by Jenkin Lloyd Jones of Oklahoma's Tulsa Tribune at that same convention, in Washington, D.C. They quoted Jones as saying:

The tragic fact is that many an editorial writer can't hit a short-range target. He's hell on distance. He can pontificate about the situation in Afghanistan with perfect safety. It takes more guts to dig up the dirt on the sheriff.
But columnist Joe Klein wrote in Time magazine in 2010 that the term originated in the 19th century when ""the British press defined Afghanistanism as the obsession with obscure foreign wars at the expense of domestic priorities"", adding that ""Afghanistanism seems likely to become a national debate [in the United States] before long: ""Is building roads and police stations in Afghanistan more important than doing so at home?""

Applications
The concept earlier came to have several applications. On one hand it was applied in North American journalism to newspaper articles about faraway places that were irrelevant to local readers. Other writers said, though, that Afghanistanism was the tendency of some editors to avoid hard local news by writing opinion pieces about events happening in distant lands. As New York Times writer James Reston put it about journalists, ""Like officials in Washington, we suffer from Afghanistanism. If it's far away, it's news, but if it's close to home, it's sociology.""
Earlier, educator Robert M. Hutchins used the expression in a speech at the California Institute of Technology in 1955:

Afghanistanism, as you know, is the practice of referring always to some remote country, place, person or problem when there is something that ought to be taken care of near at home that is very acute. So you say to a professor at Caltech, ""What about smog?"" and he says, ""Have you heard about the crisis in Afghanistan?""
In 1973, the concept was adapted to reporting on environmentalism, which was said by journalism researchers Steven E. Hungerford and James B. Lemert to deal with environmental problems of distant communiti",politics
Family values,"Family values, sometimes referred to as familial values, are traditional or cultural values that pertain to the family's structure, function, roles, beliefs, attitudes, and ideals. Additionally, the concept of family values may be understood as a reflection of the degree to which familial relationships are valued within an individual's life.
In the social sciences and U.S. political discourse, the conventional term traditional family describes the nuclear family—a child-rearing environment composed of a leading father, a homemaking mother, and their nominally biological children. A family deviating from this model is considered a nontraditional family.

Definition
Several online dictionaries define ""family values"" as the following:

""the moral and ethical principles traditionally upheld and passed on within a family, as fidelity, honesty, truth, and faith.""
""values especially of a traditional or conservative kind which are held to promote the sound functioning of the family and to strengthen the fabric of society.""
""values held to be traditionally taught or reinforced within a family, such as those of high moral standards and discipline.""

In politics
Familialism or familism is the ideology that puts priority on family and family values. Familialism advocates for a welfare system where families, rather than the government, take responsibility for the care of their members.
In the United States, the banner of ""family values"" has been used by social conservatives to express opposition to abortion, pornography, non-abstinence sex education, divorce, LGBTQ validity, same-sex marriage, gender diversity, secularism, and atheism. American conservative groups have made successful inroads promoting these policies in Africa since the early 2000s, describing them as African family values.  
The phrase family values originated with the 1992 Republican National Convention, for their ""Family Values Night"", featuring Barbara Bush as the keynote speaker. In the short term the phrase was widely panned, and at the time the staying power of the idea was underestimated.

Family values by region
Arabic culture
Interpretations of Islamic learnings and Arab culture are common for the majority of Saudis. Islam is a driving cultural force that dictates a submission to the will of Allah. The academic literature suggests that the family is regarded as the main foundation of Muslim society and culture; the family structure and nature of the relationship between family members are influenced by the Islamic religion. Marriage in Saudi culture means the union of two families, not just two individuals. In Muslim society, marriage involves a social contract that occurs with the consent of parents or guardians. Furthermore, marriage is considered the only legitimate outlet for sexual desires, and sex outside marriage (zina) is a crime that is punished under Islamic law.

Doktor Koster's Antigaspills,"Doktor Koster's Antigaspills were an early-20th-century alternative medication intended to treat stomach upset and excessive flatulence. They are best known for being administered to Adolf Hitler by his physician, Theodor Morell, to treat Hitler's stomach ailments. Morrell, regarded as a quack by Hitler's associates, administered a wide variety of unorthodox concoctions and medications to Hitler beginning in 1936.
The pill's active ingredients consisted primarily of atropine (an extract of Atropa belladonna) and strychnine.

Fellow traveller,"A fellow traveller (also fellow traveler) is a person who is intellectually sympathetic to the ideology of a political organization, and who co-operates in the organization's politics, without being a formal member. In the early history of the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik revolutionary and Soviet statesman Anatoly Lunacharsky coined the term poputchik ('one who travels the same path'); it was later popularized by Leon Trotsky to identify the vacillating intellectual supporters of the Bolshevik government. It was the political characterisation of the Russian intelligentsiya (writers, academics, and artists) who were philosophically sympathetic to the political, social, and economic goals of the Russian Revolution of 1917, but who did not join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The usage of the term poputchik disappeared from political discourse in the Soviet Union during the Stalinist era, but the Western world adopted the English term fellow traveller to identify people who sympathised with the Soviets and with communism.
In U.S. politics, during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, the term fellow traveler was primarily a pejorative applied to those on the political left, to suggest a person who was philosophically sympathetic to communism, yet was not a formal, ""card-carrying member"" of the Communist Party USA. In political discourse, the term fellow traveler was applied to intellectuals, academics, and politicians who lent their names and prestige to Communist front organizations.
In European politics, the equivalent terms for fellow traveller are: Compagnon de route and sympathisant in France; Weggenosse, Sympathisant (neutral) or Mitläufer (negative connotation) in Germany; and compagno di strada in Italy.

European usages
USSR
In 1917, after the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks applied the term Poputchik (""one who travels the same path"") to Russian writers who accepted the revolution, but who were not active revolutionaries. In the book Literature and Revolution (1923), Leon Trotsky popularized the usage of Poputchik as a political descriptor attributed to the pre-Revolutionary Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (the Social Democrats) to identify a vacillating political sympathizer. In Chapter 2, ""The Literary 'Fellow-Travellers' of the Revolution"", Trotsky said: Between bourgeois Art, which is wasting away either in repetitions or in silences, and the new art which is as yet unborn, there is being created a transitional art, which is more or less organically connected with the Revolution, but which is not, at the same time, the Art of the Revolution. Boris Pilnyak, Vsevolod Ivanov, Nicolai Tikhonov, the Serapion Fraternity, Yesenin and his group of Imagists and, to some extent, Kliuev – all of them were impossible without the Revolution, either as a group or separately. ...

Protein premium,"The wheat protein premium refers to the price differential (expressed as cents or dollars per bushel) that a high-protein wheat normally commands over wheat of the same grade specification with lower protein content. Typically, northern dark spring wheat has higher protein and brings a premium price over hard red winter wheat.

Prescriptive analytics,"Prescriptive analytics is a form of business analytics which suggests decision options for how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk, and shows the implication of each decision option. It enables an enterprise to consider ""the best course of action to take"" in the light of information derived from descriptive and predictive analytics.

Overview
Prescriptive analytics is the third and final phase of business analytics, which also includes descriptive and predictive analytics. Referred to as the ""final frontier of analytic capabilities"", prescriptive analytics entails the application of mathematical and computational sciences and suggests decision options for how to take advantage of the results of descriptive and predictive phases.
The first stage of business analytics is descriptive analytics, which still accounts for the majority of all business analytics today. Descriptive analytics looks at past performance and understands that performance by mining historical data to look for the reasons behind past success or failure. Most management reporting – such as sales, marketing, operations, and finance – uses this type of post-mortem analysis.

The next phase is predictive analytics. Predictive analytics answers the question of what is likely to happen. This is where historical data is combined with rules, algorithms, and occasionally external data to determine the probable future outcome of an event or the likelihood of a situation occurring.
The final phase is prescriptive analytics, which goes beyond predicting future outcomes but also suggesting actions to benefit from the predictions and showing the implications of each decision option.
Prescriptive analytics uses algorithms and machine learning models to simulate various scenarios and predict the likely outcomes of different decisions. It then suggests the best course of action based on the desired outcome and the constraints of the situation. Prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen. Further, prescriptive analytics suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and shows the implication of each decision option. Prescriptive analytics incorporates both structured and unstructured data, and uses a combination of advanced analytic techniques and disciplines to predict, prescribe, and adapt. It can continually take in new data to re-predict and re-prescribe, thus automatically improving prediction accuracy and prescribing better decision options. Effective prescriptive analytics utilises hybrid data, a combination of structured (numbers, categories) and unstructured data (videos, images, sounds, texts), and business rules to predict what lies ahead and to prescribe how to take advantage of this predicted future without compromising other priorities. Basu suggests that without hybrid data input, the benefits of prescriptive analytics are limit",science
Economics imperialism,"Economics imperialism is the economic analysis of non-economic aspects of life, such as crime, law, the family,  prejudice, tastes, irrational behavior, politics, sociology, culture,  religion, war, science, and research. Related usage of the term goes back as far as the 1930s.
The emergence of such analysis has been attributed to a method that, like that of the physical sciences, permits refutable implications testable by standard statistical techniques.  Central to that approach are ""[t]he combined postulates of maximizing behavior, stable preferences and market equilibrium, applied relentlessly and unflinchingly"". It has been asserted that these and a focus on economic efficiency have been ignored in other social sciences and ""allowed economics to invade intellectual territory that was previously deemed to be outside the discipline's
realm"".
Justin Fox suggests that other social sciences have also made forays into economics, such as psychology with Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky's work on prospect theory, economic anthropology and more recent economic sociology.

Force-field analysis,"In social science, force-field analysis provides a framework for looking at the factors (""forces"") that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving the movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces). The principle, developed by Kurt Lewin, is a significant contribution to the fields of social science, psychology, social psychology, community psychology, communication, organizational development, process management, and change management.

History
Lewin, a social psychologist, believed the ""field"" to be a Gestalt psychological environment existing in an individual's (or in the collective group) mind at a certain point in time that can be mathematically described in a topological constellation of constructs. The ""field"" is very dynamic, changing with time and experience. When fully constructed, an individual's ""field"" (Lewin used the term ""life space"") describes that person's motives, values, needs, moods, goals, anxieties, and ideals. 
Lewin believed that changes of an individual's ""life space"" depend upon that individual's internalization of external stimuli (from the physical and social world) into the ""life space"". Although Lewin did not use the word ""experiential"" (see experiential learning), he nonetheless believed that interaction (experience) of the ""life space"" with ""external stimuli"" (at what he calls the ""boundary zone"") was important for development (or regression). For Lewin, the development (or regression) of an individual occurs when their ""life space"" has a ""boundary zone"" experience with external stimuli. Note it is not merely the experience that causes a change in the ""life space"", but the acceptance (internalization) of external stimuli.
Lewin took these same principles and applied them to the analysis of group conflict, learning, adolescence, hatred, morale, German society, etc. This approach allowed him to break down common misconceptions of these social phenomena and to determine their basic elemental constructs. He used theory, mathematics, and common sense to define a force field and hence to determine the causes of human and group behaviour.

Zemiology,"Zemiology is the study of social harms. Zemiology gets its name from the Greek word ζημία zēmía, meaning ""harm"".
It originated as a critique of criminology and the notion of crime. In contrast with ""individual-based harms"" such as theft, the notion of social harm or social injury incorporates harms caused by nation states and corporations. These ideas have received increased attention from critical academics such as neo-Marxists and feminists who have sought to create an independent field of study, separate from criminology, that studies the harms that affect individuals' lives that are not considered to be criminal or are rarely criminalised such as mortgage misselling, poverty and unemployment.

Zemiological critique of criminology and crime
Hillyard and Tombs outline a number of criticisms of criminology and crime:

""Crime has no ontological reality"" – Crime is a construct and is based on social judgements. However, there are no central properties that pertain to the notion of crime; therefore, what is a crime will vary across time and space.
""Criminology perpetuates the myth of crime"" – Criminology is based upon the notion of crime, which fails to adequately address the social construction of the concept. Therefore, criminology's continued use of the notion within its frame of analysis perpetuates the myth that crimes are distinct acts that may be understood as separate social phenomena.
""Crime consists of many petty events"" – In a large proportion of reported crimes, the harms endured by victims, if there are any, are minimal. Hence Hillyard and Tombs argue that ""the definitions of crime in the criminal law do not reflect the only or the most dangerous of antisocial behaviours.""
""Crime excludes many serious harms"" – Many events and incidents which cause serious harm are either not part of the criminal law or, if they could be dealt with by it, are either ignored or handled without resort to it. The undue attention given to events which are defined as crimes distracts attention from more serious harm (such as pollution or poverty).
""'Crime control' is ineffective"" – Hillyard and Tombs have argued that the methods and approach to crime control have patently failed. They believe the criminal justice system is unsuccessful in fulfilling its aims and in reforming criminal offenders. It appears that the criminal justice system sees there is only one solution to crime control, and that is a prison sentence; however, it is questionable whether this actually resolves certain crimes in society.
""'Crime' gives legitimacy to the expansion of crime control"" – Since the early 1990s, governments have emphasised crime control as a key concern, and crime control has increased faster than any other area of public expenditure. Consequently, security firms have increasingly sought to provide services to the burgeoning penal state. It is argued that these private interests have played a key part in the expansion of prison, as means to deal with social problems.

History of astronomy,"The history of astronomy focuses on the contributions civilizations have made to further their understanding of the universe beyond earth's atmosphere.
Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences, achieving a high level of success in the second half of the first millennium. Astronomy has origins in the religious, mythological, cosmological, calendrical, and astrological beliefs and practices of prehistory. Early astronomical records date back to the Babylonians around 1000 BCE. There is also astronomical evidence of interest from early Chinese, Central American and North European cultures.
Astronomy was used by early cultures for a variety of reasons. These include timekeeping, navigation, spiritual and religious practices, and agricultural planning. Ancient astronomers used their observations to chart the skies in an effort to learn about the workings of the universe. During the Renaissance Period, revolutionary ideas emerged about astronomy. One such idea was contributed in 1593 by Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who developed a heliocentric model that depicted the planets orbiting the sun. This was the start of the Copernican Revolution. 
The success of astronomy, compared to other sciences, was achieved because of several reasons. Astronomy was the first science to have a mathematical foundation and have sophisticated procedures such as using armillary spheres and quadrants. This provided a solid base for collecting and verifying data.
Throughout the years, astronomy has broadened into multiple subfields such as astrophysics, observational astronomy, theoretical astronomy, and astrobiology.

Early history
Early cultures identified celestial objects with gods and spirits. They related these objects (and their movements) to phenomena such as rain, drought, seasons, and tides. It is generally believed that the first astronomers were priests who understood celestial objects and events to be manifestations of the divine, hence the connection to what is now called astrology. A 32,500-year-old carved ivory mammoth tusk could contain the oldest known star chart (resembling the constellation Orion). It has also been suggested that drawings on the wall of the Lascaux caves in France dating from 33,000 to 10,000 years ago could be a graphical representation of the Pleiades, the Summer Triangle, and the Northern Crown. Ancient structures with possibly astronomical alignments (such as Stonehenge) probably fulfilled astronomical, religious, and social functions.
Calendars of the world have often been set by observations of the Sun and Moon (marking the day, month, and year) and were important to agricultural societies, in which the harvest depended on planting at the correct time of year. The nearly full moon was also the only lighting for night-time travel into city markets.
The common modern calendar is based on the Roman calendar. Although originally a lunar calendar, it broke the traditional link of the month to the phases of the Moon and di",science

Beau's lines,"Beau's lines are deep grooved lines that run from side to side on the fingernail or the toenail. They may look like indentations or ridges in the nail plate.: 657   
This condition of the nail was named by a French physician, Joseph Honoré Simon Beau (1806–1865), who first described it in 1846.

Signs and symptoms
Beau's lines are horizontal, going across the nailline, and should not be confused with vertical ridges going from the bottom (cuticle) of the nail out to the fingertip.  These vertical lines are usually a natural consequence of aging and are harmless.  
Beau's lines should also be distinguished from Muehrcke's lines of the fingernails.  While Beau's lines are actual ridges and indentations in the nail plate, Muehrcke lines are areas of hypopigmentation without palpable ridges; they affect the underlying nail bed, and not the nail itself. Beau's lines should also be distinguished from Mees' lines of the fingernails, which are areas of discoloration in the nail plate.
As the nail grows out, the ridge in the nail can be seen to move upwards until it reaches the fingertip. When it reaches this point the fingertips can become sore for a few days as the nail bed is exposed by the misshapen nail.

Causes
There are several causes of Beau's lines. It is believed that there is a temporary cessation of cell division in the nail matrix.  This may be caused by an infection or problem in the nail fold, where the nail begins to form, or it may be caused by an injury to that area.  Some other reasons for these lines include trauma, coronary occlusion, hypocalcaemia, and skin disease. They may be a sign of systemic disease, or may also be caused by an illness of the body, as well as drugs used in chemotherapy, or malnutrition. Beau's lines can also be seen one to two months after the onset of fever in children with Kawasaki disease.  Conditions also associated with Beau's lines include uncontrolled diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, as well as illnesses associated with a high fever, such as scarlet fever, measles, mumps and pneumonia. Beau's lines can also be a sign of zinc deficiency.

A researcher found Beau's lines in the fingernails of two of six divers following a deep saturation dive to a pressure equal to 305 metres (1,001 ft) of sea water, and in six of six divers following a similar dive to 335 metres (1,099 ft). They have also been seen in Ötzi the Iceman.
Human nails grow at a rate which varies with many factors: age, the specific digit, as well as nutrition. However, typically in healthy populations fingernails grow at about 0.1 mm/day and toenails at about 0.05 mm/day.

Forensic science,"Forensic science, often confused with criminalistics, is the application of science principles and methods to support legal decision-making in matters of criminal and civil law.
During criminal investigation in particular, it is governed by the legal standards of admissible evidence and criminal procedure. It is a broad field utilizing numerous practices such as the analysis of DNA, fingerprints, bloodstain patterns, firearms, ballistics, toxicology, microscopy, and fire debris analysis.
Forensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyze evidence during the course of an investigation. While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role, performing analysis on objects brought to them by other individuals. Others are involved in analysis of financial, banking, or other numerical data for use in financial crime investigation, and can be employed as consultants from private firms, academia, or as government employees.
In addition to their laboratory role, forensic scientists testify as expert witnesses in both criminal and civil cases and can work for either the prosecution or the defense. While any field could technically be forensic, certain sections have developed over time to encompass the majority of forensically related cases.

Etymology
The term forensic stems from the Latin word, forēnsis (3rd declension, adjective), meaning ""of a forum, place of assembly"". The history of the term originates in Roman times, when a criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals in the forum. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give speeches based on their sides of the story. The case would be decided in favor of the individual with the best argument and delivery. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word forensic—as a form of legal evidence; and as a category of public presentation.
In modern use, the term forensics is often used in place of ""forensic science.""
The word ""science"", is derived from the Latin word for 'knowledge' and is today closely tied to the scientific method, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, forensic science means the use of scientific methods and processes for crime solving.

History
Origins of forensic science and early methods
The ancient world lacked standardized forensic practices, which enabled criminals to escape punishment. Criminal investigations and trials relied heavily on forced confessions and witness testimony. However, ancient sources do contain several accounts of techniques that foreshadow concepts in forensic science developed centuries later.

Grammar systems theory,"Grammar systems theory is a field of theoretical computer science that studies systems of finite collections of formal grammars generating a formal language. Each grammar works on a string, a so-called sequential form that represents an environment. Grammar systems can thus be used as a formalization of decentralized or distributed systems of agents in artificial intelligence.

Historical figure,"A historical figure is a significant person in history.

The significance of such figures in human progress has been debated. Some think they play a crucial role, while others say they have little impact on the broad currents of thought and social change.  The concept is generally used in the sense that the person really existed in the past, as opposed to being legendary. However, the legends that can grow up around historical figures may be hard to distinguish from fact.  Sources are often incomplete and may be inaccurate, particularly those from early periods of history. Without a body of personal documents, the more subtle aspects of personality of a historical figure can only be deduced. With historical figures who were also religious figures attempts to separate fact from belief may be controversial.
In education, presenting information as if it were being told by a historical figure may give it greater impact. Since classical times, students have been asked to put themselves in the place of a historical figure as a way of bringing history to life. Historical figures are often represented in fiction, where fact and fancy are combined. In earlier traditions, before the rise of a critical historical tradition, authors took less care to be as accurate when describing what they knew of historical figures and their actions, interpolating imaginary elements intended to serve a moral purpose to events.

Significance
The significance of historical figures has long been the subject of debate by philosophers. Hegel (1770–1831) considered that ""world-historical figures"" played a pivotal role in human progress, but felt that they were bound to emerge when change was needed. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) saw the study of figures such as Muhammad, William Shakespeare and Oliver Cromwell as key to understanding history. Herbert Spencer (1820–1903), an early believer in evolution and in the universality of natural law, felt that historical individuals were of little importance.

Hegel's world-historical figure
The German philosopher Hegel defined the concept of the world-historical figure, who embodied the ruthless advance of Immanuel Kant's World Spirit, often overthrowing outdated structures and ideas.  To him, Napoleon was such a figure.
Hegel proposed that a world-historical figure essentially posed a challenge, or thesis, and this would generate an antithesis, or opposing force. Eventually a synthesis would resolve the conflict.
Hegel viewed Julius Caesar as a world historical figure, who appeared at a stage when Rome had grown to the point it could no longer continue as a republican city state but had to become an empire.  Caesar failed in his bid to make himself an emperor, and was assassinated, but the empire came into existence soon afterward, and Caesar's name has become synonymous with ""emperor"" in forms such as ""kaiser"" or ""czar"".
Søren Kierkegaard, in his early essay The Concept of Irony, generally agrees with Hegel's views, such as his characteri",history

Normativity,"Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good, desirable, or permissible, and others as bad, undesirable, or impermissible. A norm in this sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes. ""Normative"" is sometimes also used, somewhat confusingly, to mean relating to a descriptive standard: doing what is normally done or what most others are expected to do in practice. In this sense a norm is not evaluative, a basis for judging behavior or outcomes; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes, without judgment. Many researchers in science, law, and philosophy try to restrict the use of the term ""normative"" to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive, descriptive, predictive, or empirical.
Normative has specialized meanings in different academic disciplines such as philosophy, social sciences, and law. In most contexts, normative means 'relating to an evaluation or value judgment.' Normative propositions tend to evaluate some object or some course of action. Normative content differs from descriptive content.

Philosophy
A normative or prescriptive statement is one that evaluates certain kinds of words, decisions, or actions as either correct or incorrect, or one that sets out guidelines for what a person ""should"" do. In philosophy, normative theory aims to make moral judgments on events, focusing on preserving something they deem as morally good, or preventing a change for the worse. The theory has its origins in Greece. Normative statements of such a type make claims about how institutions should or ought to be designed, how to value them, which things are good or bad, and which actions are right or wrong. Claims are usually contrasted with positive (i.e. descriptive, explanatory, or constative) claims when describing types of theories, beliefs, or propositions. Positive statements are (purportedly) factual, empirical statements that attempt to describe reality.
For example, ""children should eat vegetables"", and ""those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither"" are philosophically normative claims. On the other hand, ""vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins"", and ""a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both"" are positive claims. Whether a statement is philosophically normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.
There are several schools of thought regarding the status of philosophically normative statements and whether they can be rationally discussed or defended. Among these schools are the tradition of practical reason extending from Aristotle through Kant to Habermas, which asserts that they can, and the tradition of emotivism, which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no cognitive content.
There is large debate in philosophy surrounding whether one can ge",science
Age of Imperialism,"Imperialism is the maintaining and extending of power over foreign nations, particularly through expansionism, employing both hard power (military and economic power) and soft power (diplomatic power and cultural imperialism). Imperialism focuses on establishing or maintaining hegemony and a more or less formal empire. While related to the concept of colonialism, imperialism is a distinct concept that can apply to other forms of expansion and many forms of government.

Etymology and usage
The word imperialism originated from the Latin word imperium, which means ""to command"", ""to be sovereign"", or simply ""to rule"". The word “imperialism” was first produced in the 19th century to decry Napoleon III's despotic militarism and his attempts at obtaining political support through foreign military interventions. The term became common in the current sense in Great Britain during the 1870s; by the 1880's it was used with a positive connotation. By the end of the 19th century it was being used to describe the behavior of empires at all times and places. Hannah Arendt and Joseph Schumpeter defined imperialism as expansion for the sake of expansion.
The term was and is mainly applied to Western and Japanese political and economic dominance, especially in Asia and Africa, in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars. Some writers, such as Edward Said, use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organized around an imperial core and a periphery. This definition encompasses both nominal empires and neocolonialism.

Versus colonialism
The term ""imperialism"" is often conflated with ""colonialism""; however, many scholars have argued that each has its own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that imperialism operates from the centre as a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, while colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions; however, colonialism still includes invasion. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes between imperialism and colonialism by stating: ""imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian, Chinese or Ottoman have traditionally been excluded from discussions of colonialism, though this is beginning to change, since it is accepted that they also sent populations into the territories they ruled.: 116 
Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes fin",history
Farm income,"In United States agricultural policy, several measures are used to gauge farm income over a given period of time.

Gross cash income is the sum of all receipts from the sale of crops, livestock, and farm related goods and services as well as all forms of direct payments from the government.
Gross farm income is the same as gross cash income with the addition of nonmoney income, such as the value of home consumption of self-produced food and the imputed gross rental value of farm dwellings.
Net cash income is gross cash income less all cash expenses such as for feed, seed, fertilizer, property taxes, interest on debt, wages to hired labor, contract labor and rent to nonoperator landlords.
Net farm income is gross farm income less cash expenses and noncash expenses, such as capital consumption, perquisites to hired labor, and farm household expenses. It is a longer term measure of the ability of the farm to survive as a viable income-earning business.
Net cash income is a shorter term measure of cash flow.

Farm income and balance sheet
The income statement measures the profitability of a farm business for a particular period of time, usually one year. The balance sheet measures the wealth or financial position of the business at a particular point in time by reporting the farm’s assets, debt, and net worth.
The Economic Research Service publishes the income statement and balance sheet of the Nation’s farm sector, and the farm sector financial statement for each state.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome,"Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is recurrent nausea, vomiting, and cramping abdominal pain that can occur due to prolonged, high-dose cannabis use. 
CHS is associated with frequent (weekly or more often), long-term (several months or longer) cannabis use; synthetic cannabinoids can also cause CHS. The underlying mechanism is unclear, with several possibilities proposed. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms; a history of cannabis use, especially persistent, frequent use of high-dose cannabis products; and ruling out other possible causes of hyperemesis (persistent vomiting). The condition is typically present for some time before the diagnosis is made.
The only known curative treatment for CHS is to stop using cannabis. Symptoms usually remit after two weeks of complete abstinence, although some patients continue to experience nausea, cyclic vomiting, or abdominal pain for up to 90 days. Treatments during an episode of vomiting are generally supportive in nature (one example being hydration). There is tentative evidence for the use of capsaicin cream on the abdomen during an acute episode. 
Frequent hot showers or baths are both a possible sign (diagnostic indicator) of CHS, and a short-term palliative treatment (often called hot water hydrotherapy in the medical literature).
Another condition that presents similarly is cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). The primary differentiation between CHS and CVS is that cessation of cannabis use resolves CHS, but not CVS. Another key difference is that CVS symptoms typically begin during the early morning; predominant morning symptoms are not characteristic of CHS. Distinguishing the two can be difficult since many people with CVS use cannabis, possibly to relieve their symptoms.
The syndrome was first described in 2004, and simplified diagnostic criteria were published in 2009.

Signs and symptoms
CHS is a paradoxical syndrome characterized by hyperemesis (persistent vomiting), as opposed to the better known antiemetic properties of cannabinoids. The most prominent CHS symptoms are cyclical nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, concomitant with chronic cannabinoid use. There are three phases of CHS: the prodromal phase, the hyperemetic phase, and the recovery phase.

Prodromal phase
The prodromal phase is characterized by mild symptoms of CHS, including nausea, anxiety and fear related to vomiting, mild abdominal discomfort, sweating, and increased thirst; symptoms can be more severe in the morning, but this is not always the case. During this phase, treatment with compulsive bathing is rarely reported, and some individuals may attempt to treat their symptoms with cannabis use. This phase can last for months to years.

Hyperemetic phase
The hyperemetic phase is characterized by the full syndromal symptoms of CHS, including persistent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and retching. Retching can occur up to five times per hour. Acute episodes of cannabinoid hyperemesis typically last for 24–48 hours. The sy",medicine

Internet
In 2009, American Samoa was connected to the Internet using the American Samoa Hawaii Cable (ASH) undersea communications cable that increased bandwidth from 20 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s. The project used a defunct PacRim East cable built in 1993 that previously connected Hawaii with New Zealand. The cable system now connects Samoa to American Samoa and then to Hawaii where it will connect to global submarine networks. In July 2018, the Hawaiki cable was activated with a branch providing a 200 Gb/s connection from Pago Pago to Hawaii, New Zealand, Australia, and Oregon.

Situation in 2016
In 2012, American Samoa had the most expensive Internet access service in the U.S. according to Engadget.
Under Governor Togiola Tulafono investment in a fibre optic network to replace aging copper infrastructure across all the islands of American Samoa and the construction in 2015 of a 1.2 Gbit/s satellite uplink via O3b Networks which more than doubled available bandwidth to the rest of the world resulted in broadband Internet service becoming more affordable, with the price of the cheapest available residential package decreasing from $75/month to $50/month and download speeds of the base package increasing from 256 kbit/s to 768 kbit/s. The improved connectivity to the outside world has revived previously stalled hopes that a call center could be opened in American Samoa, boosting the local economy.

Sexual dimorphism measures,"Although the subject of sexual dimorphism is not in itself controversial, the measures by which it is assessed differ widely. Most of the measures are used on the assumption that a random variable is considered so that probability distributions should be taken into account. In this review, a series of sexual dimorphism measures are discussed concerning both their definition and the probability law on which they are based. Most of them are sample functions, or statistics, which account for only partial characteristics, for example the mean or expected value, of the distribution involved. Further, the most widely used measure fails to incorporate an inferential support.

Introduction
It is widely known that sexual dimorphism is an important component of the morphological variation in biological populations (see, e.g., Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1984; Oxnard, 1987; Kelley, 1993). In higher Primates, sexual dimorphism is also related to some aspects of the social organization and behavior (Alexander et al., 1979; Clutton-Brock, 1985). Thus, it has been observed that the most dimorphic species tend to polygyny and a social organization based on male dominance, whereas in the less dimorphic species, monogamy and family groups are more common. Fleagle et al. (1980) and Kay (1982), on the other hand, have suggested that the behavior of extinct species can be inferred on the basis of sexual dimorphism and, e.g. Plavcan and van Schaick (1992) think that sex differences in size among primate species reflect processes of an ecological and social nature. Some references on sexual dimorphism regarding human populations can be seen in Lovejoy (1981), Borgognini Tarli and Repetto (1986) and Kappelman (1996).
These biological facts do not appear to be controversial. However, they are based on a series of different sexual dimorphism measures, or indices. Sexual dimorphism, in most works, is measured on the assumption that a random variable is being taken into account. This means that there is a law which accounts for the behavior of the whole set of values that compose the domain of the random variable, a law which is called distribution function. Because both studies of sexual dimorphism aim at establishing differences, in some random variable, between sexes and the behavior of the random variable is accounted for by its distribution function, it follows that a sexual dimorphism study should be equivalent to a study whose main purpose is to determine to what extent the two distribution functions - one per sex - overlap (see shaded area in Fig. 1, where two normal distributions are represented).

Measures based on sample means
In Borgognini Tarli and Repetto (1986) an account of indices based on sample means can be seen. Perhaps, the most widely used is the quotient,

Contemporary history,"Contemporary history, in English-language historiography, is a subset of modern history that describes the historical period from about 1945 to the present. In the social sciences, contemporary history is also continuous with, and related to, the rise of postmodernity.
Contemporary history is politically dominated by the Cold War (1947–1991) between the Western Bloc, led by the United States, and the Eastern Bloc, led by the Soviet Union. The confrontation spurred fears of a nuclear war. An all-out ""hot"" war was avoided, but both sides intervened in the internal politics of smaller nations in their bid for global influence and via proxy wars. The Cold War ultimately ended with the Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The latter stages and aftermath of the Cold War enabled the democratization of much of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Decolonization was another important trend in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa as new states gained independence from European colonial empires during the period from 1945–1975. The Middle East also saw a conflict involving the new state of Israel, the rise of petroleum politics, the continuing prominence but later decline of Arab nationalism, and the growth of Islamism. The first supranational organizations of government, such as the United Nations and European Union, emerged during the period after 1945.
Countercultures rose and the sexual revolution transformed social relations in western countries between the 1960s and 1980s, as seen in the protests of 1968. Living standards rose sharply across the developed world because of the post-war economic boom. Japan and West Germany both emerged as exceptionally strong economies. The culture of the United States spread widely, with American television and movies spreading across the world. Some Western countries began a slow process of deindustrializing in the 1970s; globalization led to the emergence of new financial and industrial centers in Asia. The Japanese economic miracle was later followed by the Four Asian Tigers of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. China launched major economic reforms from 1979 onward, becoming a major exporter of consumer goods around the world.
Science made new advances after 1945, which included spaceflight, nuclear technology, lasers, semiconductors, molecular biology, genetics, particle physics, and the Standard Model of quantum field theory. The first commercial computers were created, followed by the Internet, beginning the Information Age.

In 1945, the Allies of World War II had defeated all significant opposition to them. They established the United Nations to govern international relations and disputes. A looming question was how to handle the defeated Axis nations and the shattered nations that the Axis had conquered. Following the Yalta Conference, territory was divided into zones for which Allied country would have responsibility and manage rebu",history
Family-friendly,"A family-friendly product or service is one that is considered to be suitable for all members of an average family.  Family-friendly restaurants are ones that provide service to families that have young children. Frequently, family-friendly products avoid marketing solely to children and attempt to make the product palatable to adults as well.

Politics
In politics, new workplace legislation may be introduced to strengthen the family unit through giving parents more flexible family-friendly working hours or educational reforms to helping children with special needs and to give parents more control over how they are schooled.

Hospitality industry
In the 2010s, hotels in the United States began to concentrate services into narrower concepts such as child-friendliness (where children stay and eat free) and pet-friendliness within the overall family-friendliness customer oriented concept.

Media
The precise definition of ""family-friendly"" can vary depending upon the perceived acceptability of content for children — one of the most challenged books in United States libraries is Captain Underpants, a book that contains toilet humor that parents read out to children. Consumer advocacy groups representing parents have lobbied against media that contains profanity and criticized what they see as attempts to deny other families the ability to choose what is appropriate for their children. In December 2019 a broad coalition of US consumer groups, including the CDC and the CCFC, called for the Federal Trade Commission to carry out a sweeping review of digital media companies that target children. The values of the individual family, such as their belief in religion, can also affect whether the family perceives a product as family-friendly.
Both the MPAA film rating system and most television content rating systems have ratings for family-friendliness: a G rating in either is universally acceptable for all audiences, while a PG rating suggests that, while generally safe for children to watch, that there should be a parent or guardian present for guidance, since some mild adult-oriented material may be present. The MPAA's film rating system has not been without controversy (itself established after the Hays Code, which required all films to be at least somewhat family-friendly, was abolished), as theater chain interest groups have noted that films rated as high as R (adult-oriented films that persons under 17 cannot watch without an adult) could be interpreted as being family-friendly if the viewer is tolerant of profanity, while others may have far too much graphic violence or borderline-pornographic sexual images to be suitable for children.
The North American Entertainment Software Rating Board, which rates video games, classifies family-friendly content with an E rating.

A family-friendly (or all-ages) show, event or venue refers to one with no age restrictions for entry. In the United States, as applied to the world of concerts, this can refer to",politics
Neolithic,"The Neolithic or New Stone Age (from Greek νέος néos 'new' and λίθος líthos 'stone') is an archaeological period, the final division of the Stone Age in Europe, Asia, Mesopotamia and Africa (c. 10,000 BC to c. 2,000 BC). It saw the Neolithic Revolution, a wide-ranging set of developments that appear to have arisen independently in several parts of the world. This ""Neolithic package"" included the introduction of farming, domestication of animals, and change from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one of settlement. The term 'Neolithic' was coined by Sir John Lubbock in 1865 as a refinement of the three-age system.
The Neolithic began about 12,000 years ago, when farming appeared in the Epipalaeolithic Near East and Mesopotamia, and later in other parts of the world. It lasted in the Near East until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic (Copper Age) from about 6,500 years ago (4500 BC), marked by the development of metallurgy, leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age.
In other places, the Neolithic followed the Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) and then lasted until later. In Ancient Egypt, the Neolithic lasted until the Protodynastic period, c. 3150 BC. In China, it lasted until circa 2000 BC with the rise of the pre-Shang Erlitou culture, as it did in Scandinavia.

Origin
Following the ASPRO chronology, the Neolithic started in around 10,200 BC in the Levant, arising from the Natufian culture, when pioneering use of wild cereals evolved into early farming. The Natufian period or ""proto-Neolithic"" lasted from 12,500 to 9,500 BC, and is taken to overlap with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) of 10,200–8800 BC. As the Natufians had become dependent on wild cereals in their diet, and a sedentary way of life had begun among them, the climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas (about 10,000 BC) are thought to have forced people to develop farming.
The founder crops of the Fertile Crescent were wheat, lentil, pea, chickpeas, bitter vetch, and flax. Among the other major crop domesticated were rice, millet, maize (corn), and potatoes. Crops were usually domesticated in a single location and ancestral wild species are still found.[1] 
Early Neolithic age farming was limited to a narrow range of plants, both wild and domesticated, which included einkorn wheat, millet and spelt, and the keeping of dogs. By about 8000 BC, it included domesticated sheep and goats, cattle and pigs.
Not all of these cultural elements characteristic of the Neolithic appeared everywhere in the same order: the earliest farming societies in the Near East did not use pottery. In other parts of the world, such as Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia, independent domestication events led to their own regionally distinctive Neolithic cultures, which arose completely independently of those in Europe and Southwest Asia. Early Japanese societies and other East Asian cultures used pottery before developing agriculture.

Australian Tazos,"Tazos are disks that were distributed as promotional items with products of Frito-Lay and its subsidiaries around the world. The idea behind Tazos started out similar to Pogs, whereby each Tazo contained a score value, and a game was played to 'win' Tazos from other players.
Tazos have been released in several different formats, ranging from the original circular disks, to octagonal disks, and in later years, to resemble more of a collectible card. In addition to the Japanese Pog Battle game, some Tazo series feature small incisions around the outside, allowing players to fit them together and build objects. The Star Wars series also included additional pieces which allowed players to construct spaceships.
Tazos are commonly made from a plastic base, but some series have been produced from cardboard or aluminium (such as the Australian Yu-Gi-Oh! Metallix series).

Tazos series
Tazos started out with a set of 100 disks featuring the images of Looney Tunes characters and 124 Tiny Toons tazos in 1994. The disks were added to the products of Mexican snacks company Sabritas and were named after the expression taconazo (to kick with the heel) which was a reference to another popular school game in Mexico where children open bottles with their shoes trying to launch the caps the furthest.

Desmalvinización,"Desmalvinización (Spanish, translated as dismalvinisation) is a concept and phenomenon in Argentine society and politics that emerged after the defeat of the Falklands War in 1982 and the early years of the return to democracy. Through this process, the media refrained from mentioning the war. It contrasts with the nationalistic, anti-British fervour that proceeded and accompanied the war, encouraged by the military junta that ruled Argentina at the time. When the soldiers returned, they were almost ignored by society, being regarded by the collective imagination as mere ""war kids"" and victims of the military dictatorship that ruled Argentine during that time.   
The dismalvinisation rhetoric stripped away every heroic and patriotic act that took place in the islands, as well as encapsulating the prevailing social and political climate in Argentine at the end of such a conflict which was taken as a ""product of the dictatorship"". As a consequence, it seemed necessary to delegitimize the war, to diminish it, and to overshadow everything associated with it. Argentine nationalism rapidly vanished after the war and taken as shameful. Those who consider the war as a patriotic cause or as an anticolonial struggle, were seen as dictatorship apologists.
It gets its name from the Spanish denomination for the islands: Islas Malvinas. The author of the concept was the French political scientist and sociologist Alain Rouquié, and it was used by veterans, political forces, and various authors. This concept can be defined as ""a political-discursive device aimed at producing a 'narrative' and establishing an 'imaginary' about the Falklands in Argentine society."" It achieved significant social resonance in the recent history of Argentina and it is frequently used when discussing the post-war period.

Re-malvinización
In the years leading up to the thirtieth anniversary of the war in 2012, the Argentine society and media started to renew the claim of the nationalist Falklands cause. This is known as ""re-malvinización"". As part of this, president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has criticised the earlier desmalvinización and pledged to make the islands' ownership a central plank of her presidency. 
House of Lords member Daniel Hannan says that re-malvinización is designed merely to ""distract people from domestic discontents"" and to attract new potential voters bringing up a national cause, rather like the original war justification of the leader of the junta, Leopoldo Galtieri, that he intended to make up for the junta's plummeting popularity invading the islands.

Breastmilk medicine,"Breastmilk medicine refers to the non-nutritional usage of human breast milk (HBM) as a medicine or therapy to cure diseases. Breastmilk is perceived as an important food that provides essential nutrition to infants. It also provides protection in terms of immunity by direct transfer of antibodies from mothers to infants. The immunity developed via this mean protects infants from diseases such as respiratory diseases, middle ear infections, and gastrointestinal diseases. HBM can also produce lifelong positive therapeutic effects on a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmunity, and asthma.
Therapeutic use of breastmilk has long been a part of natural pharmacopeia, and ethnomedicine. The effectiveness of HBM and fresh colostrum as a treatment for inflammatory disorders such as rhinitis, skin infection, soring nipples, and conjunctivitis has been reported by public health nurses. Currently, many breastmilk components have shown therapeutic benefits in preclinical studies and are being evaluated by clinical studies.

Anti-inflammatory effects
HBM can be used to treat inflammations. Breastfeeding has an anti-inflammatory effect that is conveyed by its chemical components’ interaction with body cells. The major chemical component that produces the anti-inflammatory effect in both colostrum and transitional milk are glycoprotein and lactoferrin. Lactoferrin has multiple actions including lymph-stimulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-fungal effects.  The anti-inflammatory effects of lactoferrin are attributed to its iron-binding properties, inhibition of inflammation-causing molecules including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), stimulation of the activity and maturation of lymphocytes as well as preservation of an antioxidant environment.  Besides, lactoferrin protects infants against bacterial and fungal infections in combination with other peptides present in HBM.

Respiratory viral infection in infants
Lactoferrin in HBM can also inhibit the invasion and proliferation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is a virus commonly found in the human respiratory tract and causes mild cold-like symptoms.  Lactoferrin can interact directly with the F glycoprotein which is a protein on the surface of the virus that is responsible for presenting the virus to body cells and causing infections.

Adenovirus is another group of viruses that targets the mucosal membrane of the human respiratory tract. It usually causes mild to severe infection with symptoms like the common cold or flu.  Lactoferrin can prevent infection of adenovirus since it can interfere with the primary receptors of the virus. HBM regurgitation into the nose after breastfeeding is a way to eliminate these mucosal bacteria and protect infants against recurring nose infections in breastfed infants in the long term.

Moral outsourcing,"Moral outsourcing refers to placing responsibility for ethical decision-making on to external entities, often algorithms. The term is often used in discussions of computer science and algorithmic fairness, but it can apply to any situation in which one appeals to outside agents in order to absolve themselves of responsibility for their actions. In this context, moral outsourcing specifically refers to the tendency of society to blame technology, rather than its creators or users, for any harm it may cause.

Definition
The term ""moral outsourcing"" was first coined by Dr. Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist concerned with the overlap between artificial intelligence and social issues. Chowdhury used the term to describe looming fears of a so-called “Fourth Industrial Revolution” following the rise of artificial intelligence.
Moral outsourcing is often applied by technologists to shrink away from their part in building offensive products. In her TED Talk, Chowdhury gives the example of a creator excusing their work by saying they were simply doing their job. This is a case of moral outsourcing and not taking ownership for the consequences of creation. 
When it comes to AI, moral outsourcing allows for creators to decide when the machine is human and when it is a computer - shifting the blame and responsibility of moral plights off of the technologists and onto the technology. Conversations around AI and bias and its impacts require accountability to bring change. It is difficult to address these biased systems if their creators use moral outsourcing to avoid taking any responsibility for the issue. 
One example of moral outsourcing is the anger that is directed at machines for “taking jobs away from humans” rather than companies for employing that technology and jeopardizing jobs in the first place. 
The term ""moral outsourcing"" refers to the concept of outsourcing, or enlisting an external operation to complete specific work for another organization. In the case of moral outsourcing, the work of resolving moral dilemmas or making choices according to an ethical code is supposed to be conducted by another entity.

Real-World Applications
In the medical field, AI is increasingly involved in decision-making processes about which patients to treat, and how to treat them. The responsibility of the doctor to make informed decisions about what is best for their patients is outsourced to an algorithm. Sympathy is also noted to be an important part of medical practice; an aspect that artificial intelligence, glaringly, is missing. This form of moral outsourcing is a major concern in the medical community.  
Another field of technology in which moral outsourcing is frequently brought up is autonomous vehicles. California Polytechnic State University professor Keith Abney proposed an example scenario: ""Suppose we have some [troublemaking] teenagers, and they see an autonomous vehicle, they drive right at it. They know the autonomous vehicle will swerve off the ",technology
Georgian era,"The Georgian era was a period in British history from 1714 to c. 1830–1837, named after the Hanoverian kings George I, George II, George III and George IV. The definition of the Georgian era is also often extended to include the relatively short reign of William IV, which ended with his death in 1837. The subperiod that is the Regency era is defined by the regency of George IV as Prince of Wales during the illness of his father George III. The transition to the Victorian era was characterized in religion, social values, and the arts by a shift in tone away from rationalism and toward romanticism and mysticism.
The term Georgian is typically used in the contexts of social and political history and architecture.  The term Augustan literature is often used for Augustan drama, Augustan poetry and Augustan prose in the period 1700–1740s. The term Augustan refers to the acknowledgement of the influence of Latin literature from the ancient Roman Republic.
The term Georgian era is not applied to the time of the two 20th-century British kings of this name, George V and George VI. Those periods are simply referred to as Georgian.

Arts and culture
Georgian society and its preoccupations were well portrayed in the novels of writers such as Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Laurence Sterne, Mary Shelley and Jane Austen, characterised by the architecture of Robert Adam, John Nash and James Wyatt and the emergence of the Gothic Revival style, which hearkened back to a supposed golden age of building design.
The flowering of the arts was most vividly shown in the emergence of the Romantic poets, principally through Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Blake, John Keats, Lord Byron and Robert Burns. Their work ushered in a new era of poetry, characterised by vivid and colourful language, evocative of elevating ideas and themes.
The paintings of Thomas Gainsborough, Sir Joshua Reynolds and the young J. M. W. Turner and John Constable illustrated the changing world of the Georgian period – as did the work of designers like Capability Brown, the landscape designer.
Fine examples of distinctive Georgian architecture are Edinburgh's New Town, Georgian Dublin, Grainger Town in Newcastle upon Tyne, the Georgian Quarter of Liverpool and much of Bristol and Bath.
The music of John Field, Handel, Haydn, Clementi, Johann Christian Bach, William Boyce, Mozart, Beethoven and Mendelssohn was some of the most popular in England at that time.

Grand Tour
The height of the Grand Tour coincided with the 18th century and is associated with Georgian high society. This custom saw young upper-class Englishmen travelling to Italy by way of France and the Netherlands for intellectual and cultural purposes. Notable historian Edward Gibbon remarked of the Grand Tour as useful for intellectual self-improvement. The journey and stay abroad would usually take a year or more. This would eventually lead to the basis for the ",history
Levi Boone,"Levi Day Boone (December 6, 1808  – January 24, 1882) served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1855–1856) for the American Party (Know-Nothings).

Early life
Boone was born near Lexington, Kentucky, the seventh son of Squire and Anna Grubbs Boone. Squire Boone, Sr. was Daniel Boone's father and Levi Boone's great-grandfather, making Levi Boone Daniel Boone's great-nephew. Young Levi lost his father at the age of 9 when Squire finally succumbed to wounds which he incurred at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.
Despite the poverty the family was plunged into by the death of Squire Boone, Levi graduated from the medical school of Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky in 1829 at the age of 21. He moved to Illinois and eventually established a practice in Hillsboro.  In 1832, he served in the Black Hawk War, first in the cavalry and then as a surgeon. In 1833, Dr. Boone married Louise M. Smith, daughter of Theophilus W. Smith, Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, with whom he had 11 children.

Chicago years
Arriving in Chicago in 1835, he helped organize the Cook County Medical Board and served as the organization's first secretary. Boone had a medical practice with Charles V. Dyer. He was elected the first president of the Chicago Medical Society in 1850.
In 1843, he contributed to the rift in the congregation of Chicago's First Baptist Church by giving a lecture on the scriptural basis of slavery.
In 1850, Boone unsuccessfully ran for Mayor of Chicago. He placed second, receiving 32.90% of the vote (losing to James Curtiss, who received 45.51% of the vote).
Running a second time, Boone was elected mayor in the 1855 Chicago mayoral election. Supported by a coalition of Know Nothings and temperance advocates, Boone ran for mayor on an anti-immigrant platform, along with 7 aldermen running on the same ticket. He defeated incumbent Isaac Lawrence Milliken with nearly 53% of the vote.
During his only year in office, he reorganized the Chicago police, combining the Day Police and the Night Watch into a single police force with 3 eight-hour shifts and requiring the police, for the first time, to wear uniforms. No foreign-born police were retained in the reorganization, and all new appointments were native-born Americans. He barred all immigrants from city jobs. 

Though not a teetotaler, Boone was a temperance advocate and worked to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcohol. Anticipating the passage by referendum of a Maine law to prohibit the sale of beverage alcohol in June 1855, he got the city council to pass an ordinance that raised the cost of liquor licenses from $50 to $300 a year, limited the term to three months, and attempted to enforce an old and disregarded ordinance to close taverns on Sundays. Many saw this as a means of attacking German immigrants, and on April 21, the move sparked the Lager Beer Riot after several tavern owners were arrested for selling beer on a Sunday. The referendum failed in June 1855, by a statewide vote of 54% t",medicine

Perception limit,"Human perception is limited by the biological capabilities of the senses. The human eye can detect only a narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and human hearing is restricted to specific sound frequencies. Similarly, touch, taste, and smell provide only partial information about the environment. Scientific advancements have revealed that much of reality exists beyond these perceptual boundaries, including infrared and ultraviolet light, infrasound and ultrasound frequencies, and forms of matter and energy that are not directly detectable by human senses.
Various animals perceive the world differently, with some species detecting electromagnetic fields, sensing vibrations, or seeing ultraviolet patterns. Additionally, technologies such as telescopes, microscopes, and artificial intelligence have expanded human understanding of phenomena beyond sensory perception. Research in physics, neuroscience, and cognitive science continues to explore the extent of these limitations and their implications for understanding reality.

Introduction
Human perception is the process by which individuals interpret sensory information to understand their environment. It is shaped by past experiences, contextual factors, and cognitive goals, which can introduce biases in perception. Additionally, perception is constrained by attentional capacity and can be influenced by emotional states. Studying human perception is essential for designing applications and interfaces that align with natural cognitive processes, enhancing usability and interaction with technology.
Research suggests that the human brain can retain approximately seven units of meaningful information at a time, with a typical range of five to nine. This limitation, often associated with working memory, affects how people process and recall new information. For instance, when presented with a sequence of 20 random numbers, most individuals can accurately remember only a subset—usually between five and nine of the most recent ones.
This concept has significant implications for learning and information retention. While most learning experiences do not involve memorizing random numbers, the principle highlights the importance of structuring content effectively. When introducing new material, limiting the number of key ideas to around seven can help learners better absorb and retain information, preventing cognitive overload and enhancing comprehension.
Human memory has a limited capacity, often constrained to holding 5 to 9 pieces of information at a time. However, cognitive research suggests that organizing information into meaningful clusters—known as ""chunking""—can significantly enhance retention and recall. By grouping smaller pieces of information into larger, more structured units, individuals can process and remember greater amounts of data without exceeding cognitive limitations.
This principle applies across various learning and communication strategies. For instance, acronyms serve as effec",science

Long nineteenth century,"The long nineteenth century is a term for the 125-year period beginning with the onset of the French Revolution in 1789, and ending with the outbreak of World War I in 1914. It was coined by Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg and later popularized by British  historian Eric Hobsbawm.

Background
The concept is an adaption of Fernand Braudel's 1949 notion of le long seizième siècle (""the long 16th century"" 1450–1640) and ""a recognized category of literary history"", although a period often broadly and diversely defined by different scholars. Numerous authors, before and after Hobsbawm's 1995 publication, have applied similar forms of book titles or descriptions to indicate a selective time frame for their works, such as: S. Kettering's French Society: 1589–1715 – the long seventeenth century, E. Anthony Wrigley's British population during the 'long' eighteenth century, 1680–1840, or D. Blackbourn's The long nineteenth century: A history of Germany, 1780–1918. However, the term has been used in support of historical publications to ""connect with broader audiences"" and is regularly cited in studies and discussions across academic disciplines, such as history, linguistics and the arts.

Overview
Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848 (1962), The Age of Capital: 1848–1875 (1975), and The Age of Empire: 1875–1914 (1987). Hobsbawm starts his long 19th century with the French Revolution, which sought to establish universal and egalitarian citizenship in France, and ends it with the outbreak of World War I, upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring European power balance of the 19th century proper (1801–1900) was eliminated.
In a sequel to the above-mentioned trilogy, The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914–1991 (1994), Hobsbawm details the short 20th century (a concept originally proposed by Iván T. Berend), beginning with World War I and ending with the fall of the Soviet Union, between 1914–1991.
A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used by Peter N. Stearns in the context of the world history school.

Religious history
In religious contexts, specifically those concerning the history of the Catholic Church, the long 19th century was a period of centralization of papal power over the Catholic Church. This centralization was in opposition to the increasingly centralized nation states and contemporary revolutionary movements and used many of the same organizational and communication techniques as its rivals. The church's long 19th century extended from the French Revolution (1789) until the death of Pope Pius XII (1958). This covers the period between the decline of traditional Catholic power and the emergence of secular ideas within states, and the emergence of new thinking within the church after the election of Pope John XXIII.

Wireless diver communications,"Underwater acoustic communication is a technique of sending and receiving messages in water. There are several ways of employing such communication but the most common is by using hydrophones. Underwater communication is difficult due to factors such as multi-path propagation, time variations of the channel, small available bandwidth and strong signal attenuation, especially over long ranges. Compared to terrestrial communication, underwater communication has low data rates because it uses acoustic waves instead of electromagnetic waves.
At the beginning of the 20th century some ships communicated by underwater bells as well as using the system for navigation. Submarine signals were at the time competitive with the primitive maritime radionavigation. The later Fessenden oscillator allowed communication with submarines.

Types of modulation used for underwater acoustic communications
In general the modulation methods developed for radio communications can be adapted for underwater acoustic communications (UAC). However some of the modulation schemes are more suited to the unique underwater acoustic communication channel than others. Some of the modulation methods used for UAC are as follows:

Frequency-shift keying (FSK)
Phase-shift keying (PSK)
Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
Frequency and pulse-position modulation (FPPM and PPM)
Multiple frequency-shift keying (MFSK)
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)
Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM)
The following is a discussion on the different types of modulation and their utility to UAC.

Frequency-shift keying
FSK is the earliest form of modulation used for acoustic modems. FSK usually employs two distinct frequencies to modulate data; for example, frequency F1 to indicate bit 0 and frequency F2 to indicate bit 1. Hence a binary string can be transmitted by alternating these two frequencies depending on whether it is a 0 or 1. The receiver can be as simple as having analogue matched filters to the two frequencies and a level detector to decide if a 1 or 0 was received. This is a relatively easy form of modulation and therefore used in the earliest acoustic modems. However more sophisticated demodulator using digital signal processors (DSP) can be used in the present day.
The biggest challenge FSK faces in the UAC is multi-path reflections. With multi-path (particularly in UAC) several strong reflections can be present at the receiving hydrophone and the threshold detectors become confused, thus severely limiting the use of this type of UAC to vertical channels. Adaptive equalization methods have been tried with limited success. Adaptive equalization tries to model the highly reflective UAC channel and subtract the effects from the received signal. The success has been limited due to the rapidly varying conditions and the difficulty to adapt in time.

Phase-shift keying

Heritage science,"Heritage science is the interdisciplinary domain of scientific study of cultural and natural heritage. Heritage science draws on diverse humanities, sciences and engineering disciplines. It focuses on enhancing the understanding, care and sustainable use of heritage so it can enrich people's lives, both today and in the future. Heritage science is an umbrella term encompassing all forms of scientific enquiry into human works and the combined works of nature and humans, of value to people.
The above definition was developed though a community consultation organised by ICCROM and the European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science in 2019.
The term has become widely used after 2006, when it became increasingly evident that the more traditional terms conservation science or preservation science inadequately reflected the breadth of research into cultural heritage. Heritage scientists in museums, galleries, libraries, archives, universities and research institutions support conservation (often called conservation science), access (e.g. development of new ICT tools), interpretation, including archaeometry and archaeological science (e.g. dating, provenancing, attribution), heritage management (e.g. development of tools and knowledge supporting strategic or environmental management decisions) and wider societal engagement with heritage (e.g. heritage values and ethics). Heritage science is also an excellent vehicle for public engagement with science as well as heritage.
Heritage science is seen as ""key to the long-term sustainability of heritage: it is about managing change and risk and maximising social, cultural and economic benefit not just today, but in such a way that we can pass on to future generations that which we have inherited."" Domains of research, where heritage science makes a particular input were recognised by the United Kingdom National Heritage Science Strategy documents to be museums, galleries, libraries and archives; the built historic environment and archaeology.

Theory
The field still requires its literature canon, and opinions on whether heritage science is a domain in its own right or a field of research diverge. However, this appears to be a matter of academic recognition, rather than a matter of research practice.
Heritage science is an old field of research: in his Royal Institution Christmas Lecture in 1843, Michael Faraday already pointed out how pollution importantly contributes to book degradation. The following premises appear to be of defining importance:

Heritage science is inherently biased, as scientists, by doing research on heritage, contribute to its value: they create and popularize heritage through their research.
Heritage science is neither fundamental nor experimental: work with actual heritage objects, buildings or sites cannot be repeatable, because heritage is not an experiment. On the other hand, the scientific method and deductive reasoning is easily applied when working with models and model obj",science
Outline of applied science,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to applied science:
Applied science – the branch of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications, including inventions and other technological advancements. Science itself is the  systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

Branches of applied science
Applied cryptography – applications of cryptography.
Applied science – application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment.
Actuarial science — application of mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in the insurance, finance, and other industries
Agricultural science
Agronomy – science and technology of producing and using plants for food, fuel, feed, fiber, and reclamation.
Animal husbandry – agricultural practice of breeding and raising livestock.
Aquaculture – also known as aquafarming, is the farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs and aquatic plants.
Algaculture – form of aquaculture involving the farming of species of algae.
Mariculture – cultivation of marine organisms for food and other products in the open ocean, an enclosed section of the ocean, or in tanks, ponds or raceways which are filled with seawater.
Agriculture – science of farming
Cuniculture – also known as rabbit farming, is the breeding and raising domestic rabbits, usually for their meat or fur.
Fungiculture –  process of producing food, medicine, and other products by the cultivation of mushrooms and other fungi.
Heliciculture – also called snail farming, is the process of farming or raising land snails specifically for human consumption, and more recently, to obtain snail slime for cosmetics use.
Olericulture – science of vegetable growing, dealing with the culture of non-woody (herbaceous) plants for food.
Sericulture – also called silk farming, is the rearing of silkworms for the production of silk. Although there are several commercial species of silkworms, Bombyx mori is the most widely used and intensively studied.
Food science – study concerned with all technical aspects of foods, beginning with harvesting or slaughtering, and ending with its cooking and consumption, an ideology commonly referred to as ""from field to fork"". It is the discipline in which the engineering, biological, and physical sciences are used to study the nature of foods, the causes of deterioration, the principles underlying food processing, and the improvement of foods for the consuming public.
Forestry – art and science of managing forests, tree plantations, and related natural resources.
Arboriculture – cultivation, management, and study of individual trees, shrubs, vines, and other perennial woody plants.
Silviculture – practice of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests to meet diverse needs and values. It includes regenerating, tending and h",science
Praxeology,"In philosophy, praxeology or praxiology (; from Ancient Greek  πρᾶξις (praxis) 'deed, action' and  -λογία (-logia) 'study of') is the theory of human action, based on the notion that humans engage in purposeful behavior, contrary to reflexive behavior and other unintentional behavior.
French social philosopher Alfred Espinas gave the term its modern meaning, and praxeology was developed independently by two principal groups: the Austrian school, led by Ludwig von Mises, and the Polish school, led by Tadeusz Kotarbiński.

Origin and etymology
Coinage of the word praxeology (praxéologie) is often credited to Louis Bourdeau, the French author of a classification of the sciences, which he published in his Théorie des sciences. Plan de science intégrale in 1882:

On account of their dual natures of specialty and generality, these functions should be the subject of a separate science. Some of its parts have been studied for a long time, because this kind of research, in which man could be the main subject, has always presented the greatest interest. Physiology, hygiene, medicine, psychology, animal history, human history, political economy, morality, etc. represent fragments of a science that we would like to establish, but as fragments scattered and uncoordinated have remained until now only parts of particular sciences. They should be joined together and made whole in order to highlight the order of the whole and its unity. Now you have a science, so far unnamed, which we propose to call Praxeology (from πραξις, action), or by referring to the influence of the environment, Mesology (from μεσος, environment).
However, the term was used at least once previously (with a slight spelling difference), in 1608, by Clemens Timpler in his Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum:

There was Aretology: Following that Praxiology: which is the second part of the Ethics, in general, commenting on the actions of the moral virtues.
It was later mentioned by Robert Flint in 1904 in a review of Bourdeau's Théorie des sciences.
The modern definition of the word was first given by Alfred V. Espinas (1844–1922), the French philosopher and sociologist; he was the forerunner of the Polish school of the science of efficient action. The Austrian school of economics was based on a philosophical science of the same kind.
With a different spelling, the word was used by the English psychologist Charles Arthur Mercier (in 1911), and proposed by Knight Dunlap to John B. Watson as a better name for his behaviorism, but Watson rejected it. The Chinese physiologist of behavior Zing-Yang Kuo (b. 1898) adopted the term around 1935. It was also used by William McDougall (in 1928 and later).
Previously the word praxiology, with the meaning Espinas gave to it, was used by Tadeusz Kotarbiński (in 1923). The Ukrainian economist Eugene Slutsky (1926) used it in his attempt to base economics on a theory of action. It was also used by Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises (1933), Russian Marxi",science

Alexander Technique,"The Alexander Technique, named after its developer Frederick Matthias Alexander (1869–1955), is an alternative therapy based on the idea that poor posture causes a range of health problems.: 221  The American National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health classifies it as a ""psychological and physical"" complementary approach to health when used ""together with"" mainstream conventional medicine.
Alexander began developing his technique's principles in the 1890s to address his own voice loss during public speaking.: 34–35  He credited his method with allowing him to pursue his passion for performing Shakespearean recitations.
Proponents and teachers of the Alexander Technique believe the technique can address a variety of health conditions, but there is a lack of research to support the claims. As of 2021, the UK National Health Service and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cite evidence that the Alexander Technique may be helpful for long-term back pain and for long-term neck pain, and that it could help people cope with Parkinson's disease. Both the American health-insurance company Aetna and the Australian Department of Health have conducted reviews and concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the technique's health claims to warrant insurance coverage.

Method
The Alexander Technique is most commonly taught in a series of private lessons which may last from 30 minutes to an hour. The number of lessons varies widely, depending on the student's needs and level of interest. Students are often performers, such as actors, dancers, musicians, athletes and public speakers, people who work on computers, or those who are in frequent pain for other reasons. Instructors observe their students, and provide both verbal and gentle manual guidance to help students learn how to move with better poise and less strain. Sessions include chair work – often in front of a mirror – during which the instructor will guide the student while the student stands, sits and walks, learning to move efficiently while maintaining a comfortable relationship between the head, neck, and spine, and table work or physical manipulation.
In the United Kingdom, there is no regulation for who can offer Alexander Technique services. Professional organisations do exist, however, typically offering three-year courses to people becoming instructors.

History
The Alexander Technique is based on the personal observations of Frederick Matthias Alexander (1869–1955). Alexander's career as an actor was hampered by recurrent bouts of laryngitis, but he found he could overcome it by focusing on his discomfort and tension, and relaxing. Alexander also thought posture could be improved if a person became more conscious of their bodily movements.
While on a recital tour in New Zealand (1895), Alexander came to believe in the wider significance of improved carriage for overall physical functioning, although evidence from his own publications appears to indi",medicine
Distributive justice,"Distributive justice concerns the socially just allocation of resources, goods, opportunity in a society. It is concerned with how to allocate resources fairly among members of a society, taking into account factors such as wealth, income, and social status. Often contrasted with just process and formal equal opportunity, distributive justice concentrates on outcomes (substantive equality). This subject has been given considerable attention in philosophy and the social sciences. Theorists have developed widely different conceptions of distributive justice. These have contributed to debates around the arrangement of social, political and economic institutions to promote the just distribution of benefits and burdens within a society. Most contemporary theories of distributive justice rest on the precondition of material scarcity. From that precondition arises the need for principles to resolve competing interest and claims concerning a just or at least morally preferable distribution of scarce resources.
In social psychology, distributive justice is defined as perceived fairness of how rewards and costs are shared by (distributed across) group members. For example, when some workers work more hours but receive the same pay, group members may feel that distributive justice has not occurred. To determine whether distributive justice has taken place, individuals often turn to the behavioral expectations of their group. If rewards and costs are allocated according to the designated distributive norms of the group, distributive justice has occurred.

Types of distributive norms
Five types of distributive norm are defined by Donelson R. Forsyth:

Equality: Regardless of their inputs, all group members should be given an equal share of the rewards/costs. Equality supports that someone who contributes 20% of the group's resources should receive as much as someone who contributes 60%.
Equity: Members' outcomes should be based upon their inputs. Therefore, an individual who has invested a large amount of input (e.g. time, money, energy) should receive more from the group than someone who has contributed very little. Members of large groups prefer to base allocations of rewards and costs on equity.
Power: Those with more authority, status, or control over the group should receive more than those in lower level positions.
Need: Those in greatest needs should be provided with resources needed to meet those needs. These individuals should be given more resources than those who already possess them, regardless of their input.
Responsibility: Group members who have the most should share their resources with those who have less.

Theories of distributive justice
The listed theories below are some of the most prominent theories within the field. With this in mind, the list is in no way to be considered exhaustive for distributive justice theory.

Service economy,"Service economy can refer to one or both of two recent economic developments:

The increased importance of the service sector in industrialized economies. The current list of Fortune 500 companies contains more service companies and fewer manufacturers than in previous decades.
The relative importance of service in a product offering. The service economy in developing countries is mostly concentrated in financial services, hospitality, retail, health, human services, information technology and education. Products today have a higher service component than in previous decades. In the management literature this is referred to as the servitization of products or a product-service system. Virtually every product today has a service component to it.
The old dichotomy between product and service has been replaced by a Service (economics) service–product continuum [1]. Many products are being transformed into services.
For example, IBM treats its business as a service business. Although it still manufactures computers, it sees the physical goods as a small part of the ""business solutions"" industry. They have found that the price elasticity of demand for ""business solutions"" is much less than for hardware. There has been a corresponding shift to a subscription pricing model. Rather than receiving a single payment for a piece of manufactured equipment, many manufacturers are now receiving a steady stream of revenue for ongoing contracts.
Full cost accounting and most accounting reform and monetary reform measures are usually thought to be impossible to achieve without a good model of the service economy.
Since the 1950s, the global economy has undergone a structural transformation. For this change, the American economist Victor R. Fuchs called it “the service economy” in 1968. He believes that the United States has taken the lead in entering the service economy and society in the Western countries. The declaration heralded the arrival of a service economy that began in the United States on a global scale. With the rapid development of information technology, the service economy has also shown new development trends.

Environmental effects of the service economy
This is seen, especially in green economics and more specific theories within it such as Natural Capitalism, as having these benefits:

Much easier integration with accounting for nature's services
Much easier integration with state services under globalization, e.g. meat inspection is a service that is assumed within a product price, but which can vary quite drastically with jurisdiction, with some serious effects.
Association of goods movements in raw materials and energy markets with the related negative environmental effects (representing emissions or other pollution, biodiversity loss, biosecurity risk) public bads so that no commodity can be traded without assuming responsibility for damage done by its extraction, processing, shipping, trading and sale - its comprehensive outcome

History of Holguín,"Holguín (, Spanish pronunciation: [olˈgin]) is a municipality-city in Cuba. After Havana, Santiago de Cuba, and Camagüey, it is the fourth largest city in Cuba.

History
Before Columbus, the Taino people settled in huts made from royal palm in the Holguin area later urbanized by the Spanish; their artifacts are shown at the local Holguin La Periquera museum. The settlement was founded in 1523 on land donated by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar to Captain Francisco García Holguín, a Spanish military officer. Holguin added his maternal surname to the name of the town, giving it the name San Isidoro de Holguín.  Prior to 1976, Holguín was located in the province of Oriente. Before Pope Francis's visit to the United States, in September 2015, he visited Cuba, and one of his stops was at the Diocese of Holguín to, among other things, commemorate the location where Christopher Columbus landed.

Geography
The municipality is divided into repartos or barrios. The old municipality was more extense, and in 1940 included: Aguarás, Aguas Claras, Alcalá, Arroyo Blanco del Sur, Báguanos, Cabezuelas, Cacocum, Calderón, Camazán, Cauto del Cristo, Corralillo, Cruces de Purnio, Damián, Floro Pérez, Gibara, Guabasiabo, Guayabal, Guirabo, Haticos del Purial, La Aguada, La Cuaba, La Palma, La Rioja, Las Calabazas, Managuaco, Melones, Norte, Omaja, Purnio, San Agustín, San Andrés, San Francisco, San Juan, San Lorenzo, Santa Rita, Sur, Tacámara, Tasajeras, Uñas, Uñitas, Velasco, Yareyal and Yayal.
At present time, some of the above are part of other municipalities, but the following still belong to Holguín: Aguas Claras, Guirabo, La Cuaba, Las Calabazas, Purnio, San Andrés, Yareyal.

Economy
The brewery Cervecería Bucanero is based in the city.  It makes three brands of beer: Bucanero, Cristal and Mayabe.
There are two small hotels (or villas) focusing on health tourism in the outskirts of the city, very close to the airport: Villa El Quinque and Villa El Cocal. Patients like Argentine football (soccer) star Diego Maradona have been treated there for substance addiction.
There are also two established city hotels (Pernik and El Bosque). More recently, a few small (boutique) hotels, managed by Hoteles E, have opened (Caballeriza, one block away from Parque San Isidoro (Las Flores), and Esmeralda, right across from Parque San José). As of May, 2020, and after a major restoration, there's a third boutique hotel about to be inaugurated (Saratoga), right across one of the corners of the main plaza and heart of the city (Parque Calixto Garcia).

Demographics
In 2004, the municipality of Holguín had a population of 326,740. With a total area of 658 km2 (254 sq mi), it had a population density of 497/km2 (1,290/sq mi). By  2012, the population had increased slightly to 346,195 for a population density of 520/km2 (1,300/sq mi).

Comrade,"In political contexts, comrade means a fellow party member. The political use was inspired by the French Revolution, after which it grew into a form of address between socialists and workers. Since the Russian Revolution, popular culture in the West has often associated it with communism.  As such, it can be used as a derogatory reference to left-wingers, akin to ""commie"". In particular, the Russian word товарищ (tovarishch) may be used as derogatory reference to Communists.

Etymology
The term comrade generally means 'mate', 'colleague', or 'ally', and derives from the Spanish and Portuguese term camarada, lit. 'chamber mate', from Latin camera, lit. 'chamber'  or 'room'. It may also specifically mean ""fellow soldier"", comrade in arms.

Background
Upon abolishing the titles of nobility in France, and the terms monsieur and madame (literally, 'my lord' and 'my lady'), the revolutionaries employed the term citoyen for men and citoyenne for women (both meaning 'citizen') to refer to each other. The deposed King Louis XVI, for instance, was referred to as Citoyen Louis Capet to emphasize his loss of privilege.
When the socialist movement gained momentum in the mid-19th century, socialists elsewhere began to look for a similar egalitarian alternative to terms like ""Mister"", ""Miss"", or ""Missus"". In German, the word Kamerad had long been used as an affectionate form of address among people linked by some strong common interest, such as a sport, a college, a profession (notably as a soldier), or simply friendship. The term was often used with political overtones in the revolutions of 1848, and was subsequently borrowed by French and English. In English, the first known use of the word comrade with this meaning was in 1884 in the socialist magazine Justice.

Political usage
Russian and Soviet usage
In the late 19th century, Russian Marxists and other leftist revolutionaries adopted the word ""tovarisch"" (Russian: товарищ) as a translation for the German term Kamerad. Originally, ""tovarisch"" meant ""business companion"" or ""travel (or other adventure) mate"" deriving from the Old Turkic tavar ishchi; abbreviated tov., and related to the noun товар (tovar, meaning 'merchandise'). In socialist and labour movements, it became a common form of address, as in Tovarisch Plekhanov or Tovarisch Chairman or simply as Tovarisch (especially German) social democracy. After the Russian Revolution, translations of ""tovarisch"" spread globally among communists, though the term ""comrade"" became closely associated with the Soviet Union specifically in the eyes of many.
With the February Revolution of 1917, traditional forms of address common in Tsarist Russia would become deeply unpopular and were replaced by the more republican and egalitarian title of citizen. However, this would be overshadowed by the address of comrade due to the more revolutionary connotations. The term ""citizen"" did not seem sufficiently pro-revolutionary as many monarchists identified themselves as 'Rus",politics
Electric car use by country,"Electric car use by country varies worldwide, as the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles is affected by consumer demand, market prices, availability of charging infrastructure, and government policies, such as purchase incentives and long term regulatory signals (ZEV mandates, CO2 emissions regulations, fuel economy standards, and phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles).
Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are generally divided into all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), that run only on batteries, and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), that combine battery power with internal combustion engines. The popularity of electric vehicles has been expanding rapidly due to government subsidies, improving charging infrastructure, their increasing range and lower battery costs, and environmental sensitivity. However, the stock of plug-in electric cars represented just 1% of all passengers vehicles on the world's roads by the end of 2020, of which pure electrics constituted two-thirds.
Global cumulative sales of highway-legal light-duty plug-in electric vehicles reached 1 million units in September 2015, 5 million in December 2018, and passed the 10 million milestone in 2020. By mid-2022, there were over 20 million light-duty plug-in vehicles on the world's roads. Sales of plug-in passenger cars achieved a 9% global market share of new car sales in 2021, up from 4.6% in 2020, and 2.5% in 2019.
The PEV market has been shifting towards fully electric battery vehicles. The global ratio between BEVs and PHEVs went from 56:44 in 2012, to 60:40 in 2015, and rose to 74:26 in 2019. The ratio was to 71:29 in 2021.
As of December 2023, China had the largest stock of highway legal plug-in passenger cars with 20.4 million units, almost half of the global fleet in use. China also dominates the plug-in light commercial vehicle and electric bus deployment, with its stock reaching over 500,000 buses in 2019, 98% of the global stock, and 247,500 electric light commercial vehicles, 65% of the global fleet.
Europe had about 11.8 million plug-in passenger cars at the end of 2023, accounting for around 30% of the global stock. Europe also has the world's second largest electric light commercial vehicle stock, with about 290,000 vans. As of December 2023, cumulative sales in the United States totaled 4.74 million plug-in cars since 2010, with California listed as the largest U.S. plug-in regional market with 1.77 million plug-in cars sold by 2023.
As of December 2021, Germany is the leading European country with 1.38 million plug-in cars registered since 2010.
Norway has the highest market penetration per capita in the world, and also has the world's largest plug-in segment market share of new car sales, 86.2% in 2021. Over 10% of all passenger cars on Norwegian roads were plug-ins in October 2018, and rose to 22% in 2021.
The Netherlands has the highest density of EV charging stations in the world by 2019.

Visual anthropology,"Visual anthropology  is a subfield of social anthropology that is concerned, in part, with the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, new media. More recently it has been used by historians of science and visual culture. Although sometimes wrongly conflated with ethnographic film, visual anthropology encompasses much more, including the anthropological study of all visual representations such as dance and other kinds of performance, museums and archiving, all visual arts, and the production and reception of mass media.  Histories and analyses of representations from many cultures are part of visual anthropology: research topics include sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings and photographs. Also within the province of the subfield are studies of human vision, properties of media, the relationship of visual form and function, and applied, collaborative uses of visual representations.
Multimodal anthropology describes the latest turn in the subfield, which considers how emerging technologies like immersive virtual reality, augmented reality, mobile apps, social networking, gaming along with film, photography and art is reshaping anthropological research, practice and teaching.

History
Even before the emergence of anthropology as an academic discipline in the 1880s, ethnologists used photography as a tool of research. Anthropologists and non-anthropologists conducted much of this work in the spirit of salvage ethnography or attempts to record for posterity the ways-of-life of societies assumed doomed to extinction (see, for instance, the Native American photography of Edward Curtis)
The history of anthropological filmmaking is intertwined with that of non-fiction and documentary filmmaking, although ethnofiction may be considered as a genuine subgenre of ethnographic film. Some of the first motion pictures of the ethnographic other were made with Lumière equipment (Promenades des Éléphants à Phnom Penh, 1901). Robert Flaherty, probably best known for his films chronicling the lives of Arctic peoples (Nanook of the North, 1922), became a filmmaker in 1913 when his supervisor suggested that he take a camera and equipment with him on an expedition north. Flaherty focused on ""traditional"" Inuit ways of life, omitting with few exceptions signs of modernity among his film subjects (even to the point of refusing to use a rifle to help kill a walrus his informants had harpooned as he filmed them, according to Barnouw; this scene made it into Nanook where it served as evidence of their ""pristine"" culture). This pattern would persist in many ethnographic films to follow (see as an example Robert Gardner's Dead Birds).
By the 1940s and early 1950s, anthropologists such as Hortense Powdermaker, Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead (Trance and Dance in Bali, 1952) and Mead and Rhoda Metraux, eds., (The Study of Culture at a Distance, 1953) were bringing ant",science
Chronocentrism,"Chronocentrism is the assumption that certain time periods (typically the present) are better, more important, or a more significant frame of reference than other time periods, either past or future. The perception of more positive attributes such as morality, technology, and sophistication to one's own time could lead an individual as a member of a collectivity to impose their forms of time on others and impede the efforts towards more homogeneous temporal commons.

History
Chronocentrism (from the Greek chrono- meaning ""time"") was coined by sociologist Jib Fowles in an article in the journal Futures in February, 1974. Fowles described chronocentrism as ""the belief that one's own times are paramount, that other periods pale in comparison"". A critical view described it as the belief that only the present counts and that the past is irrelevant except to serve as a reference to a few basic assumptions about what went before. More recently, it has been defined as ""the egotism that one's own generation is poised on the very cusp of history"".  The term had been used earlier in a study about attitudes to ageing in the workplace. Chronocentricity: ""...only seeing the value of one's own age cohort...described the tendency for younger managers to hold negative perceptions of the abilities or other work-related competencies of older employees."" This type of discrimination is a form of ageism.

Ethnocentrism
Chronocentrism as ethnocentrism is the perceiving and judging of a culture's historical values in terms of the standards of one's own time period.

Antichronocentrism
The Long Now Foundation is an organization that encourages the use of 5-digit years, e.g. ""02024"" instead of ""2024,"" to help emphasize how early the present time is in their vision of the timeline of humanity.  The use of two-digit years before Y2K was an example of chronocentrism (in the early years of computing, the years 2000 and 1899 were believed to be too far in the future or the past, and thus of less importance than being able to save two digits in computerizing and typing out years).

Applications
The ""Copernican time principle"" is a temporal analog of the Copernican principle for space, which states that no spatial location is any more or less special of a frame of reference than any other spatial location (i.e., that our physical universe has no center). Some authors have extended this to also include that no point in time is any more or less special than any other point in time (e.g., in outdated steady-state theories), though this cannot be universally applied (e.g., the Big-Bang singularity is a special point in time that can be logically used as a frame of reference to date later events).
Until the twentieth century, chronocentrism was the norm in musical performance because musicians assumed that playing styles survived largely unchanged from previous centuries. For instance, Romantic musicians used contemporary styles when performing earlier repertoire.

Rugby league sevens,"Rugby league sevens (or simply sevens) is a seven-a-side derivative of rugby league football, which is usually a thirteen-a-side sport. The game is substantially the same as full rugby league, with some rule changes and shorter games. Sevens is usually played in festivals, as its shorter game play allows for a tournament to be completed in a day or over a single weekend.
As well as being played by club sides, rugby league sevens is particularly popular with social teams, formed in the workplace or from the patrons of a public house for example, as it is often difficult in these places to form a full squad of 13 players and four substitutes of regular players. Some tournaments prefer to play rugby league nines (rugby league with nine players on each side) to distinguish it from rugby union sevens.

History
The game of rugby sevens dates back to its invention by Ned Haig in Melrose in the Scottish Borders in 1883, just over a decade before the schism in rugby football in 1895, which led to the creation of rugby league and rugby union. However, rugby sevens did not spread outside Scotland before the 1920s. That said, the larger part of Scotland's rugby league players have come from Borders backgrounds.
The record rugby league sevens attendance remains the 80,000 that attended a 1933 match between Australia and England at Roundhay Park in Leeds. This match was also attended by English royalty.
The first rugby league sevens tournament was played in Australia in 1961.
The major tournament was the World Sevens played prior to the beginning of the National Rugby League season in Sydney, Australia. That tournament has been suspended but sevens is played around the world at different levels from junior teams to international ones. Sevens is considered to be a good tool to increase the skills of players and to help emerging rugby league nations.

Playing area
Sevens is played on a standard rugby league playing field as defined in Section 1 of the International Laws of the Game.

Teams
Teams are composed of three forwards, one half and three backs.

Rules
Sevens follows the rules of 13-a-side rugby league with exceptions. Each rugby league nation is at liberty to adopt a modified version of international rugby league rules for their own domestic competitions; as a result the rules of rugby league sevens can vary too, even before changes implemented by competition organisers.
Matches have two halves of seven minutes. Unlimited substitutions are allowed from a squad totalling 12 players. In sevens, smaller scrums, formed from the three forwards on each team, are formed. All kicks for goal should be drop kicks in sevens. After points have been scored a tap kick restart is taken by the non-scoring side.
The World Sevens, the world's premier sevens event while it operated, had two 7 minute halves up to and including the semi-finals with extra time played in the event of tie at the end normal time.  The final was longer with two 10-minute halves. In 2004, the Worl",sports

Isin-Larsa period,"The Isin-Larsa period (c. 2025–1763 BCE, Middle Chronology, or 1961–1699 BCE, Short Chronology) is a phase in the history of ancient Mesopotamia, which extends between the end of the Third Dynasty of Ur and the conquest of Mesopotamia by King Hammurabi of Babylon leading to the creation of the First Babylonian dynasty. According to the approximate conventional dating, this period begins in 2025 BCE and ended in 1763 BCE. It constitutes the first part of the Old Babylonian period (2025–1595 BCE), the second part being the period of domination of the first dynasty of Babylon, which ends with the Sack of Babylon in 1595 BCE and the rise of the Kassites.
The Third Dynasty of Ur immediately preceded the Isin-Larsa period, and its fall was due to the combined attacks of the Amorites from the west, and the Elamites from the east. As its name suggests, the Isin-Larsa period saw successively the emergence of two great powers in Lower Mesopotamia: the kingdom of Isin, which attempts to seek the succession of the kingdom of Ur after its fall and established the Dynasty of Isin, and the kingdom of Larsa, whose fall marks the end of the period. In reality, neither of these two kingdoms exercised an undeniable hegemony in Lower Mesopotamia, and they had to coexist with other less powerful kingdoms (such as Uruk, Babylon, and Mankisum), while further north their influence was non-existent and gave way to other powerful political entities (Eshnunna, Ekallatum, Mari, Yamkhad). The dynasties of this period have in common a Semitic Amorite origin, even if they quickly acculturated to Mesopotamian traditions.

Isin as the main polity (2025–1924 BCE)
When the deteriorating Third Dynasty of Ur (Ur III) finally collapsed at the hands of the Elamites at the end of the third millennium BCE, a power vacuum was left that other city-states scrambled to fill. The last king of the Ur III dynasty, Ibbi-Sin, lacked the resources and the organized government needed to expel the Elamite invaders. One of his governmental officials, Ishbi-Erra, relocated from Ur to Isin, another city in southern Mesopotamia, and established himself as a ruler there. One of Ishbi-Erra's year names reports his defeat of Ibbi-Sin in battle.
Although he is not considered to be a part of the Third Dynasty of Ur, Ishbi-Erra did make some attempts at continuing the trappings of that dynasty, most likely to justify his rule. Ishbi-Erra had ill luck expanding his kingdom, however, for other city-states in Mesopotamia rose to power as well—Eshnunna and Ashur were developing into powerful centers. However, he did succeed in repulsing the Elamites from the Ur region. This gave the Isin dynasty control over the culturally significant cities of Ur, Uruk, and the spiritual center of Nippur.
For over 100 years, Isin flourished. Remains of large building projects, such as temples, have been excavated. Many royal edicts and law-codes from that period have been discovered. The centralized political structure of Ur II",history
Agreement on Agriculture,"The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) is an international treaty of the World Trade Organization. It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO on 1 January 1995.

History
Origins
The idea of replacing agricultural price support with direct payments to farmers decoupled from production dates back to the late 1950s, when the twelfth session of the GATT Contracting Parties selected a Panel of Experts chaired by Gottfried Haberler to examine the effect of agricultural protectionism, fluctuating commodity prices and the failure of export earnings to keep pace with import demand in developing countries.
The 1958 Haberler Report stressed the importance of minimising the effect of agriculture subsidies on competitiveness and recommended replacing price support with direct supplementary payments not linked with production, anticipating discussion on green box subsidies. Only more recently, though, has this shift become the core of the reform of the global agricultural system.

Historical context
By the 1980s, government payments to agricultural producers in industrialised countries had caused large crop surpluses, which were unloaded on the world market by means of export subsidies, pushing food prices down. The fiscal burden of protective measures increased, due both to lower receipts from import duties and higher domestic expenditure. In the meantime, the global economy had entered a cycle of recession, and the perception that opening up markets could improve economic conditions led to calls for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. The round would open up markets in services and high-technology goods, ultimately generating much needed efficiency gains. In order to engage developing countries, many of which were ""demandeurs"" of new international disciplines, agriculture, textiles, and clothing were added to the grand bargain.
In leading up to the 1986 GATT Ministerial Conference in Punta del Este, Uruguay, farm lobbies in developed countries strongly resisted compromises on agriculture. In this context, the idea of exempting production and ""trade-neutral"" subsidies from WTO commitments was first proposed by the United States in 1987, and echoed soon after by the EU. By guaranteeing farmers continued support, it also neutralised opposition. In exchange for bringing agriculture within the disciplines of the WTO and committing to future reduction of trade-distorting subsidies, developed countries would be allowed to retain subsidies that cause ""not more than minimal trade distortion"" in order to deliver various public policy objectives.

Three pillars
The Agreement on Agriculture consists of three pillars — domestic support, market access, and export subsidies.

Domestic support
The first pillar of the Agreement on Agriculture is ""domestic support"". AoA divides domestic support into two categories: trade-distorting and non-trade-distorting (or minim",economics
Macro social work,"Macro social work  is the use of social work skills training and perspective to produce large scale  social change or social justice of some kind. Unlike micro or mezzo social work, which deals with individual and small group issues, macro social work aims to address societal problems at their roots; however, it has recently not received the same level of importance.

Professional roles and functions
Macro social workers work in a variety of public institutions, including legislative (as elected officials and advocates), executive (as administrators, managers, researchers and experts) or judicial (as expert witnesses in courts) on federal, state, or local level. Macro social workers are also found in the private sector usually in executive positions in their respective organizations. Historically, social work included both micro and macro practice, but there has been a generational trend towards micro practice, which focuses on therapeutic work with people, families, and groups.

Scope and importance
Macro social work is a branch of social work that focuses on large-scale social processes and systemic issues. It involves interventions and strategies that target communities, organizations, and policy to promote social change, justice, and the well-being of populations.
Macro social work encompasses a broad range of activities including advocacy, community organizing, policy analysis, program development, and business administration. Practitioners in this field work to influence social policies, develop and implement social programs, and lead community initiatives. They aim to address systemic issues such as poverty, discrimination, and inequality by promoting policies that lead to equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.
One of the key aspects of macro social work is its focus on social justice. Social workers in this field advocate for policies that ensure equal access to services and resources, protect human rights, and address social injustices. This can involve lobbying for legislative changes, participating in public debates, and working with marginalized communities to amplify their voices.

History and the discussion about ""re-envisioning"" macro social work practice
The roots of macro social work can be traced back to the settlement house movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where social workers like Jane Addams and Mary Richmond sought to address the root causes of poverty and inequality through community-based interventions and policy advocacy. This tradition has evolved over time to include various approaches and methodologies aimed at systemic change.
The inception of macro social work practice in the United States (although it was not called by that name at the time) was with the advent of social work as an academic discipline itself. in the early 1900s, Jane Addams, the founder of the feminist movement, is generally accepted as the very first macro social worker. The feminist movement was the very first ma",science
Mobile phone throwing,"Mobile phone throwing is an international sport that began in Finland in the year 2000. It's a sport in which participants throw mobile phones and are judged on distance or technique. The world record holder is Dries Feremans, with an official Guinness World Record throw of 110m 42 cm.
There are usually four categories in the sport:

Original (also called ""Traditional""): an over-the-shoulder throw with the farthest distance winning (best of three)
Freestyle: contestants get points for aesthetics and creative choreography
Team original: up to three competitors have one throw each, with their scores combined at the end
Junior: for children aged twelve or younger
The phones used vary not just between events but between competitors, with any phone that weighs over 220 grams being acceptable.  At some events, the choice is down to personal preference from phone models provided by the event organisers, while other events provide the same phone model to all contestants.

Rules
The sponsor provides the phones used in the Mobile Phone Throwing World Championships. There are many different kinds of phones to choose from, weighing between 220g to 400g. Every competitor can choose between any of the phones that are provided. During the throw, the competitor must stay within the throwing area. If the thrower steps over the area, the throw will be disqualified. The phone must land within the marked throwing sector. The official jury of the competition will accept or disqualify the throw. Also, there is no drug testing but if the jury believes the competitor is not mentally or physically fit to throw, they will not be allowed to enter. The jury's decisions are final and cannot be protested.

Rules for Juniors: Traditional over-the-shoulder throw. Only for children 12 years and under (ID must be presented upon request). The one who can throw the phone farthest is the winner; there's one throw per competitor.
Rules for Freestyle:  No age limits.  Team and individual series teams can comprise from men or women, max. 3 people per team. In this category, throws will be judged by their style and aesthetics. Points are awarded on a scale from 1 to 6 and the competitor with the highest score wins. One throw per competitor.  
Rules for Original: Traditional over-the-shoulder throw. Only the length of the throw counts, the one who can throw the mobile phone the furthest is the winner, one throw per competitor, a separate series for men and women.
Rules for Team Original: Traditional over-the-shoulder throw. Max. 3 persons per team. Teams can either be men or women, team members' scores will be summed up and the highest score wins. One throw per competitor.

History
Mobile Phone Throwing became a hit when first arranged in year 2000 in Savonlinna, Finland.  Its organizer was the translation and interpretation company Fennolingua. Its multi-national personnel and many athletics threw away their frustrations along with the mobile phones. Local recycling centers were a partn",sports
Formal linguistics,"Formal linguistics is the branch of linguistics which uses applied mathematical methods for the analysis of natural languages. Such methods include formal languages, formal grammars and first-order logical expressions. Formal linguistics also forms the basis of computational linguistics. Since the 1980s, the term is often used to refer to Chomskyan linguistics.

Approaches
Semiotic
Methods of formal linguistics were introduced by semioticians such as Charles Sanders Peirce and Louis Hjelmslev. Building on the work of David Hilbert and Rudolf Carnap, Hjelmslev proposed the use of formal grammars to analyse, generate and explain language in his 1943 book Prolegomena to a Theory of Language. In this view, language is regarded as arising from a mathematical relationship between meaning and form.
The formal description of language was further developed by linguists including J. R. Firth and Simon Dik, giving rise to modern grammatical frameworks such as systemic functional linguistics and functional discourse grammar. Computational methods have been developed by the framework functional generative description among others.
Dependency grammar, created by French structuralist Lucien Tesnière, has been used widely in natural language processing.

Psychological
Analytical models based on semantics and discourse pragmatics were rejected by the Bloomfieldian school of linguistics whose derivatives place the object into the verb phrase, following from Wilhelm Wundt's Völkerpsychologie. Formalisms based on this convention were constructed in the 1950s by Zellig Harris and Charles Hockett. These gave rise to modern generative grammar. It has been suggested that dependency relations are caused by a random mutation in the human genome.
Generative models of formal linguistics, such as head-driven phrase structure grammar, have also been used in natural language processing.

Quantum finance,"Quantum finance is an interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods developed by quantum physicists and economists in order to solve problems in finance.  It is a branch of econophysics.

Quantum continuous model
Most quantum option pricing research typically focuses on the quantization of the classical Black–Scholes–Merton equation from the perspective of continuous equations like the Schrödinger equation. Emmanuel Haven builds on the work of Zeqian Chen and others, but considers the market from the perspective of the Schrödinger equation. The key message in Haven's work is that the Black–Scholes–Merton equation is really a special case of the Schrödinger equation where markets are assumed to be efficient. The Schrödinger-based equation that Haven derives has a parameter ħ (not to be confused with the complex conjugate of h) that represents the amount of arbitrage that is present in the market resulting from a variety of sources including non-infinitely fast price changes, non-infinitely fast information dissemination and unequal wealth among traders. Haven argues that by setting this value appropriately, a more accurate option price can be derived, because in reality, markets are not truly efficient.
This is one of the reasons why it is possible that a quantum option pricing model could be more accurate than a classical one.  Belal E. Baaquie has published many papers on quantum finance and even written a book that brings many of them together. Core to Baaquie's research and others like Matacz are Richard Feynman's path integrals.
Baaquie applies path integrals to several exotic options and presents analytical results comparing his results to the results of Black–Scholes–Merton equation showing that they are very similar.  Edward Piotrowski et al. take a different approach by changing the Black–Scholes–Merton assumption regarding the behavior of the stock underlying the option. Instead of assuming it follows a Wiener–Bachelier process, they assume that it follows an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. With this new assumption in place, they derive a quantum finance model as well as a European call option formula.
Other models such as Hull–White and Cox–Ingersoll–Ross have successfully used the same approach in the classical setting with interest rate derivatives. Andrei Khrennikov builds on the work of Haven and others and further bolsters the idea that the market efficiency assumption made by the Black–Scholes–Merton equation may not be appropriate. To support this idea, Khrennikov builds on a framework of contextual probabilities using agents as a way of overcoming criticism of applying quantum theory to finance. Luigi Accardi and Andreas Boukas again quantize the Black–Scholes–Merton equation, but in this case, they also consider the underlying stock to have both Brownian and Poisson processes.

Little Ice Age,"The Little Ice Age (LIA) was a period of regional cooling, particularly pronounced in the North Atlantic region. It was not a true ice age of global extent. The term was introduced into scientific literature by François E. Matthes in 1939. The period has been conventionally defined as extending from the 16th to the 19th centuries, but some experts prefer an alternative time-span from about 1300 to about 1850.
The NASA Earth Observatory notes three particularly cold intervals. One began about 1650, another about 1770, and the last in 1850, all of which were separated by intervals of slight warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report considered that the timing and the areas affected by the LIA suggested largely independent regional climate changes, rather than a globally synchronous increased glaciation. At most, there was modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during the period.
Several causes have been proposed: cyclical lows in solar radiation, heightened volcanic activity, changes in the ocean circulation, variations in Earth's orbit and axial tilt (orbital forcing), inherent variability in global climate, and decreases in the human population (such as from the massacres by Genghis Khan, the Black Death and the epidemics emerging in the Americas upon European contact).

Areas involved
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report (TAR) of 2001 described the areas that were affected:

Evidence from mountain glaciers does suggest increased glaciation in a number of widely spread regions outside Europe prior to the twentieth century, including Alaska, New Zealand and Patagonia. However, the timing of maximum glacial advances in these regions differs considerably, suggesting that they may represent largely independent regional climate changes, not a globally-synchronous increased glaciation. Thus current evidence does not support globally synchronous periods of anomalous cold or warmth over this interval, and the conventional terms of ""Little Ice Age"" and ""Medieval Warm Period"" appear to have limited utility in describing trends in hemispheric or global mean temperature changes in past centuries. ... [Viewed] hemispherically, the ""Little Ice Age"" can only be considered as a modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during this period of less than 1°C relative to late twentieth century levels.
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of 2007 discusses more recent research and gives particular attention to the Medieval Warm Period:

... when viewed together, the currently available reconstructions indicate generally greater variability in centennial time scale trends over the last 1 kyr than was apparent in the TAR. ... The result is a picture of relatively cool conditions in the seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries and warmth in the eleventh and early fifteenth centuries, but the warmest conditions are apparent in the twentieth century.

Agricultural production,"Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production, aquaculture, and forestry for food and non-food products. Agriculture was a key factor in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in the cities. While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the 20th century, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output.
As of 2021, small farms produce about one-third of the world's food, but large farms are prevalent. The largest 1% of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares (120 acres) and operate more than 70% of the world's farmland. Nearly 40% of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres). However, five of every six farms in the world consist of fewer than 2 hectares (4.9 acres), and take up only around 12% of all agricultural land. Farms and farming greatly influence rural economics and greatly shape rural society, affecting both the direct agricultural workforce and broader businesses that support the farms and farming populations.
The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, cooking oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi. Global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food, 32 million tonnes of natural fibers and 4 billion m3 of wood. However, around 14% of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level.
Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but also contributed to ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to climate change, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and other agricultural pollution. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation, and climate change, all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some countries ban them.

Etymology and scope
The word agriculture is a late Middle English adaptation of Latin agricultūra, from ager 'field' and cultūra 'cultivation' or 'growing'. While agriculture usually refers to human activities, certain species of ant, termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to 60 million years. Agriculture is defined with varyi",economics
History of Karnataka,"The History of Karnataka goes back several millennia. Several great empires and dynasties have ruled over Karnataka and have contributed greatly to the history, culture and development of Karnataka as well as the entire Indian subcontinent. The Chindaka Nagas of central India Gangas,  Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, Chalukyas of Vengi, Yadava Dynasty of Devagiri were all of Kannada origin who later took to encouraging local languages.
In the medieval and early modern periods, the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Sultanate became the major powers in Karnataka. The latter disintegrated to form five Deccan Sultanates. The Deccan Sultanates defeated the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Maratha Empire ruled most of present-day Karnataka. Maratha rule was most fortified in the northern regions of present-day Karnataka. The first Maratha expeditions in the region were led by Chhatrapati Shivaji. As Maratha power weakened in the 1780s, the Kingdom of Mysore began occupying lands in Southern Karnataka.
After the Anglo-Mysore Wars, where the East India Company defeated the forces of Tipu Sultan, Company Rule began in India. Karnataka was divided between the Bombay Presidency, the Kingdom of Mysore and the Nizam of Hyderabad.
India  became Independent in 1947, and according to the States Reorganization Act, 1956, the Kannada-speaking areas of Hyderabad State, Madras State were unified with Mysore State. The state was renamed as Karnataka in 1973.

Prehistory
The credit for doing early extensive study of prehistoric Karnataka goes to Robert Bruce-Foote and this work was later continued by many other scholars. The pre-historic culture of Karnataka (and South India in general) is called the hand-axe culture, as opposed to the Sohan culture of North India. Paleolithic hand axes and cleavers in the shape of pebbles made with quartz and quartzite which have been found in places such as Lingadahalli in Chikkamagaluru district and Hunasagi in Yadgir district, and a wooden spike at Kibbanahalli in Tumkur district are examples of old Stone Age implements. There are reports that a polished stone axe was discovered at Lingasugur in the Raichur district Neolithic sites (new Stone Age) of importance are Maski in Raichur district, Brahmagiri in Chitradurga district etc., with abundance of evidence that man begun to domesticate animals such as cows, dogs and sheep, use copper and bronze weapons, wear bangles, rings, necklaces of beads and ear-rings and have burial chambers. To the end of the Neolithic era, during the Megalithic age, people in Karnataka began to use long swords, sickles, axes, hammers, spikes, chisels and arrows, all made of iron.

Traditional climbing,"Traditional climbing (or trad climbing) is a type of free climbing in rock climbing where the lead climber places removable protection while simultaneously ascending the route; when the lead climber has completed the route, the second climber (or belayer) then removes this protection as they ascend the route. Traditional climbing differs from sport climbing where the protection equipment is already pre-drilled into the rock in the form of bolts.
Traditional climbing carries a much higher level of risk than bolted sport climbing as the climber may not have placed the protection equipment correctly while ascending the route, or there may be few opportunities to insert satisfactory protection (e.g. on very difficult routes). Traditional climbing was once the dominant form of free climbing but since the mid-1980s, sport climbing — and its related form of competition climbing — became more popular for single pitch, and all grade milestones from 8a+ (5.13c) onwards were on single-pitch sport routes.
From the early 2000s, there was a resurgence in interest in single-pitch traditional climbing as climbers began greenpointing sport routes (e.g. Greenspit and The Path), and setting new milestones for traditional routes (e.g. Cobra Crack at 8c (5.14b) by Sonnie Trotter, and Rhapsody at 8c+ (5.14c) by Dave MacLeod). Female climber Beth Rodden created a new traditional route at the same level as the men with Meltdown also at 8c+ (5.14c). In 2019, Jacopo Larcher created what is considered the first 9a (5.14d) graded traditional route with Tribe.

Description
Traditional climbing is a form of free climbing (i.e. no artificial or mechanical device can be used to aid progression, unlike with aid climbing), which is performed in pairs where the lead climber places removable climbing protection into the route while ascending. After the lead climber has reached the top, the second climber (or belayer) removes this temporary climbing protection while climbing the route. Some consider the hammering in of pitons while climbing the route, as long as they are only for climbing protection and not to aid progression, to also be traditional climbing.

Traditional climbing differs from sport climbing that has in-situ climbing protection already pre-bolted into the route, and the lead climber just clips their rope, via quickdraws, into the bolts as they ascend. As a result, sport climbing is therefore a much safer, and less stressful, form of free climbing. Traditional climbing differs from free solo climbing where no climbing protection is used whatsoever.

First free ascent
With the greater popularity of sport climbing, traditional climbing evolved to embrace some of its redpointing techniques in qualifying a climb as a first free ascent (FFA). The previously controversial practices of hangdogging (i.e. practicing on an abseil rope), and headpointing (i.e. practicing on a top rope) are now accepted by the leading traditional climbers.

Cleavage (politics),"In political science and sociology, a cleavage is a historically determined social or cultural line which divides citizens within a society into groups with differing political interests, resulting in political conflict among these groups. Social or cultural cleavages thus become political cleavages once they get politicized as such. Cleavage theory accordingly argues that political cleavages predominantly determine a country's party system as well as the individual voting behavior of citizens, dividing them into voting blocs. These blocs are distinguished by similar socio-economic characteristics, who vote and view the world in a similar way. It is distinct from other common political theories on voting behavior in the sense that it focuses on aggregate and structural patterns instead of individual voting behaviors.
Classical cleavage theories have generally been focused on the persistence of dominant conflicts within national political systems over the course of history. Political sociologists Seymour Martin Lipset and Stein Rokkan (1967) for example used the term in their often cited essay on cleavage structures in West European politics. In their essay, the authors argue how the European party systems at their time of writing were still largely based on the social and cultural cleavages that characterized European societies a century earlier. They therefore argue that these 'frozen party systems' can be seen as political expressions of historically determined societal divisions.
Although some authors have claimed that the cleavages in Lipset and Rokkan's theory are still dominant for contemporary voting behaviors in Western Europe, others have argued that these traditional cleavages have become less important and new conflict lines have emerged. Conflicts that have emerged around several new political cleavages are for example cultural, such as conflicts over integration and multiculturalism, or environmental, such as ongoing politics over climate change.

Frozen party systems
The cleavages in Lipset and Rokkan's classical theory have its origins in two developments in 19th century Western Europe. On the one hand, European societies at the time saw a period of so-called national revolutions. These events were revolutionary as the centralized state came to take over political roles that had formerly been assigned to decentralized and/or religious communities. According to Lipset and Rokkan, these historical national revolutions gave rise to the following two societal and political cleavages: 

Centre versus periphery: between elites in the central administrative areas and those in more outlying areas. This usually expresses itself in terms of regional nationalism.  For example, in Spain many regions have regionalist or separatist parties. This division is, according to Lipset and Rokkan, caused by the creation of modern nation-states, where some states were better than others at assimilating other cultures into the majority nation.

Human nutrition,"Human nutrition deals with the provision of essential nutrients in food that are necessary to support human life and good health. Poor nutrition is a chronic problem often linked to poverty, food security, or a poor understanding of nutritional requirements. Malnutrition and its consequences are large contributors to deaths, physical deformities, and disabilities worldwide. Good nutrition is necessary for children to grow physically and mentally, and for normal human biological development.

Recommended Dietary Allowances
The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are scientifically determined levels of essential nutrient intake, deemed sufficient by the Food and Nutrition Board to meet the nutritional needs of nearly all healthy individuals.
The first RDAs were published in 1943, during World War II, with the aim of setting standards for optimal nutrition. The initial editions outlined daily nutrient recommendations for various age groups, reflecting the latest scientific insights at the time (NRC, 1943). The history and evolution of the RDAs have been extensively detailed by the chair of the first Committee on Recommended Dietary Allowances (Roberts, 1958). Over the years, the RDAs have been periodically updated, with the current version being the tenth edition.
Originally intended to address nutrition issues related to national defense, the RDAs now serve multiple roles, including guiding food supply planning for population groups, interpreting dietary intake data, establishing standards for food assistance programs, assessing the nutritional adequacy of food supplies, designing nutrition education initiatives, aiding in the development of new food products, and setting guidelines for food labeling. However, the data underpinning these nutrient requirement estimates are often limited.
The nutritional requirements system adopted by the United States and Canada refers to Dietary Reference Intake (DRI). The DRI is a set of nutritional guidelines developed by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), part of the National Academies in the United States. Established in 1997, the DRI was created to expand upon the previous standards known as the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). Unlike the RDAs, the DRI encompasses a broader range of nutritional recommendations. The DRI values are distinct from those found on food and dietary supplement labels in the U.S. and Canada, which use Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Values (%). These labeling standards were originally based on RDAs from 1968 but were updated in 2016.
Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) represent the nutritional standards set by the United Kingdom's Department of Health and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for assessing and planning dietary intakes. The UK's Department of Health introduced these guidelines in 1991 with the publication of Dietary Reference Values for Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom.

Surf lifesaving,"Surf lifesaving is a multifaceted social movement that comprises key aspects of voluntary lifeguard services and competitive surf sport. Originating in early 20th century Australia, the movement has expanded globally to other countries, including New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Surf lifesavers in Australia are colloquially known as ""Clubbies"".

History
Surf lifesaving originated in Australia in 1907 in response to drownings at local beaches in Sydney. Such groups became necessary following the relaxing of laws prohibiting daylight bathing on Australian beaches. Volunteer groups of men were trained in life saving methods and patrolled the beaches as lifesavers looking after public safety.
There had been some debate between Manly Life Saving Club, Bronte Surf Lifesaving Club and Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club as to which was formed first.  After a panel of SLSA historians reviewed all the documentation provided by each club in 2005, SLSA agreed that they recognise Bondi as the first surf life saving club.  They stated “A hardy perennial in surf lifesaving history is the question of the first surf club — Bondi or Bronte. As this study has shown, the first group of organised lifesavers formed on Manly Beach in 1899. While moves on Bondi, Bronte and Manly in early 1907 saw the organisation of irregulars, it was the surf bathers of Bondi who first organised themselves as a formal club in February 1907.”  The Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club was officially established on 21 February 1907, at the Royal Hotel in Bondi - as was recorded in the newspaper The East Sydney Argus, and in the Waverley Council minutes acknowledging receipt of a letter from the newly formed group.
On 10 October 1907, the Surf Bathing Association of New South Wales (SBANSW) was founded with nine clubs and affiliated associations. The nine “foundation” clubs were the Royal Life Saving Society, Manly Surf Club, Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club, Coogee Surf Life Brigade (Coogee Surf Life Saving Club), Bronte Surf Brigade (Bronte Surf Lifesaving Club), Bondi Surf and Social Club (North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club), Tamarama Surf Club (later disbanded, however nowadays Tamarama Surf Life Saving Club), Maroubra Surf Club (Maroubra Surf Life Saving Club), United Wanderers Surf Club, and Woollahra Surf Club. The first club outside of Sydney was Kiama Surf Bather's Club, founded in 1908.

The first New Zealand Surf Lifesaving Clubs began in the years 1909 to 1910 leading off with: Castlecliff (Wanganui), Lyall Bay (Wellington), New Brighton (Christchurch) and Worser Bay (Wellington). Within the next few years other clubs started forming around five regions: Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Gisborne/Napier/New Plymouth and Wanganui.
In the northern region, Piha Surf Life Saving Club was founded in 1934 and as such is the oldest club on Auckland's west coast and is the home of Piha Rescue.  Soon after the New Zealand clubs were formed, rivalry began",sports
Food processing,"Food processing is the transformation of agricultural products into food, or of one form of food into other forms. Food processing takes many forms, from grinding grain into raw flour, home cooking, and complex industrial methods used in the making of convenience foods.  Some food processing methods play important roles in reducing food waste and improving food preservation, thus reducing the total environmental impact of agriculture and improving food security.
The Nova classification groups food according to different food processing techniques.
Primary food processing is necessary to make most foods edible while secondary food processing turns ingredients into familiar foods, such as bread. Tertiary food processing results in ultra-processed foods and has been widely criticized for promoting overnutrition and obesity, containing too much sugar and salt, too little fiber, and otherwise being unhealthful in respect to dietary needs of humans and farm animals.

Processing levels
Primary food processing
Primary food processing turns agricultural products, such as raw wheat kernels or livestock, into something that can eventually be eaten. This category includes ingredients that are produced by ancient processes such as drying, threshing, winnowing and milling grain, shelling nuts, and butchering animals for meat.  It also includes deboning and cutting meat, freezing and smoking fish and meat, extracting and filtering oils, canning food, preserving food through food irradiation, and candling eggs, as well as homogenizing and pasteurizing milk.
Contamination and spoilage problems in primary food processing can lead to significant public health threats, as the resulting foods are used so widely.  However, many forms of processing contribute to improved food safety and longer shelf life before the food spoils.  Commercial food processing uses control systems such as hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to reduce the risk of harm.

Secondary food processing
Secondary food processing is the everyday process of creating food from ingredients that are ready to use. Baking bread, regardless of whether it is made at home, in a small bakery, or in a large factory, is an example of secondary food processing.  Fermenting fish and making wine, beer, and other alcoholic products are traditional forms of secondary food processing.  Sausages are a common form of secondary processed meat, formed by comminution (grinding) of meat that has already undergone primary processing. Most of the secondary food processing methods known to humankind are commonly described as cooking methods.

Tertiary food processing
Tertiary food processing is the commercial production of what is commonly called processed food.  These are ready-to-eat or heat-and-serve foods, such as frozen meals and re-heated airline meals.

History
Food processing dates back to the prehistoric ages when crude processing incorporated fermenting, su",economics
Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link,"Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link, commonly referred to as GMSL, is a serial link technology that is used for video distribution in cars. It was developed by Maxim Integrated. Maxim Integrated was acquired by Analog Devices in 2021.
GMSL is an asymmetric, full duplex SerDes technology - which means that it transports data at a high rate in the downlink (or forward) direction, while simultaneously transporting a lower data rate in the uplink (or reverse) direction. It transports power, bidirectional control data, Ethernet, bidirectional audio and multiple streams of unidirectional video simultaneously over a single coaxial cable or shielded twisted pair cable. A GMSL serializer receives video from a standard digital video interface such as HDMI, DisplayPort, Camera Serial Interface (CSI-2) or Display Serial Interface (DSI) and can transmit it over a cable of up to 15 m in length. The data is received by a GMSL deserializer that can output it on another standard digital video interface. GMSL video transport may be unprotected or encrypted using HDCP.

History of GMSL
High resolution flat-panel displays in vehicles started becoming a standard part of in-car entertainment systems in early 2000 time frame. Backup camera systems were mandated in the US by congress in 2008, and were widely adopted in cars from 2008 to 2011. [1] The first technologies dedicated to connect these displays and cameras were FPD-Link from National Semiconductor and GMSL from Maxim Integrated. GMSL was introduced in 2008, and supported up to 3.125 Gb/s data rate in the downlink direction. This was sufficient to deliver uncompressed video from the head unit to high-definition displays commonly used in in-car entertainment systems, and to transport video from cameras to a CPU.
As increasing display resolutions and camera resolutions  were adopted by the automotive industry, there was a need to transport higher video data rates in automotive video systems. The second generation of GMSL, known as GMSL2 with data rate up to 6 Gbit/s became available in 2018. GMSL2 supports FHD displays and cameras with resolution up to 8 megapixels. Display Stream Compression was added in GMSL2 to increase the capacity of the link as needed to support 4k displays over a single cable. GMSL2 was also the first generation GMSL to support Ethernet tunneling. GMSL2 supports 187.5 Mbit/s or 1.5 Gbit/s data rates on the reverse channel.
The 3rd generation GMSL devices (GMSL3) became available in 2021. GMSL3 has 12 Gbit/s forward data rate, supporting aggregation of multiple cameras, daisy chaining of displays and multiple 4k display video streams over a single cable.

Automotive Applications
GMSL is primarily used in In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) systems and Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) in vehicles.
In IVI systems, GMSL links connect displays, such as electronic instrument clusters, navigation systems, center console displays, and rear seat entertainment displays to the vehicle’s head-unit. The ",technology

Inclusive language,"Inclusive language is a language style that seeks to avoid expressions that its proponents perceive as expressing or implying ideas that are sexist, racist, or otherwise biased, prejudiced, or insulting to particular group(s) of people; and instead uses language intended by its proponents to avoid offense and fulfill the ideals of egalitarianism, social inclusion and equity.  Its aim is bias-free communication, that attempts to be equally inclusive of people of all ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious affiliations, abilities, and ages by communicating in a way that makes no assumptions about the receiver of such communication.
Its supporters argue that language is often used to perpetuate and spread prejudice and that creating intention around using inclusive language can help create more productive, safe, and profitable organizations and societies. The term ""political correctness"" is sometimes used to refer to this practice, either as a neutral description by supporters, by commentators in general,  or with negative connotations by its opponents. Use of gender-neutral terminology has been controversial in languages where  ""all grammar is gendered"", such as Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and German; some areas have banned its use.
Inclusive language is usually adopted by following a language guide that lists words and expression not to use and substitutes for them. Language guides are used by many organizations, especially non-profits (at least in the United States).

Bias
An important part of communicating in a bias-free manner is by making sure to engaging in meaningful conversations using bias-free language. The writer's word choice is vital in terms of effectively communicating in ways that do not offend the receiver. According to Locker, ""Bias-free language is language that is sensitive to people's sex, race, age, physical condition and many other categories. Bias-free language does not discriminate and therefore includes all readers in a fair and friendly manner.""
Bias exists everywhere, even if it is not always acknowledged. If a verbal or written communication includes any of the following, it may be biased:

Unsupported claims.
Extreme or inappropriate language.
For written text, there may be no clear author.
Spoken communication may have a speaker with a poor reputation.
These sources should be questioned for their bias because it could impact their validity in their points. Therefore, avoiding bias in all communication will ensure that the point is crystal clear and the speaker is trusted.

Scope

In French, a reference to a mixed-gender group of friends would traditionally be  written as ""amis"", but a gender-neutral variation changed its spelling to ""ami·e·s.""

Obshchina,"An obshchina (, lit. 'commune'; Russian: община, IPA: [ɐpˈɕːinə]) or mir (, lit. 'world'; Russian: мир, IPA: [mʲir]), also officially termed as a rural community  (Russian: сельское общество; Ukrainian: сільське товариство) between the 19th and 20th centuries, was a  peasant village community (as opposed to an individual farmstead), or a khutor, in Imperial Russia. The term derives from the word obshchiy (Russian: общий, literally ""common"").
The mir was a community consisting of former serfs, or state peasants and their descendants, settled as a rule in a single village, although sometimes a village included more than one mir and, conversely, several villages were sometimes combined in a single mir. The title of the land was vested in the mir and not in the individual peasant. Members of the mir had the right to the allotment, on some uniform basis, of a holding that each member cultivated separately. A holding could not be sold or bequeathed without the consent of the mir. As a consequence of its collective tenure, the mir had the power to repartition the land from time to time among its constituent households. The mir dealt primarily with the household and not with the individual. The peasant had a right to a holding but not to a particular holding, and he could not dispose of it freely.
The vast majority of Russian peasants held their land in communal ownership within a mir community which acted as a village government and a cooperative. Arable land was divided in sections based on soil quality and distance from the village. Each household had the right to claim one or more strips from each section depending on the number of adults in the household. The purpose of this allocation was not so much social (to each according to his needs) as it was practical (that each person pay his taxes). Strips were periodically re-allocated on the basis of a census to ensure equitable share of the land. This was enforced by the state which had an interest in the ability of households to pay their taxes.

History
The concept of Obshchina was an important part in Old Russia and had its roots in Slavic communities. A detailed statistical description of the Russian village commune was provided by Alexander Ivanovich Chuprov. Communal land ownership of the mir predated serfdom, surviving emancipation and the Russian Revolution. Until the abolition of serfdom in 1861, the mir could either contain serfs or free peasants. In the first case, lands reserved for serf use were assigned to the mir for allocation by the proprietor.
Even after the 1861 emancipation of the serfs, a peasant in his everyday work normally had little independence from obshchina, governed at the village level (mir) by the full assembly of the community (skhod). Among its duties were control and redistribution of the common land and forest (if such existed), levying recruits for military service and imposing punishments for minor crimes. Obshchina was also held responsible for taxes underpaid by m",economics
Economic impact analysis,"An economic impact analysis (EIA) examines the effect of an event on the economy in a specified area, ranging from a single neighborhood to the entire globe. It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.
An economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).
An economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.  The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.
outside of the study region, so the output impact is not synonymous with local business profits.  A more conservative measure of economic activity is the value added impact, which estimates the increase in the study region's gross regional product.  The gross regional product (GRP) is very similar to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP), and represents the total size of the local economy.  This impact estimates the increase in local employee wages plus local business profits (not total revenue, like the output impact).  However, the value added impact may overstate local profits when they are transferred overseas (such as in the form of dividends or investments in foreign facilities).
An even more conservative measure is the woman labour income impact, which represents the increase in total money paid to local employees in the form of salaries and wages.  The increases in income may come in the form of raises and/or increased hours for existing employees, or new jobs for the unemployed.  This is a measure of the economic impact on just personal incomes, not business revenues or profits.  A similar measure is the employment impact, which measures the increase in the number of total employees in the local region.  Instead of measuring the economic impact in terms of money, this measure presents the impact on the number of jobs in the region.

Sources of economic impacts
In addition to the types of impacts, economic impact analyses often estimate the sources of the impacts.  Each impact can be decomposed into different components, depending on the effect that caused the impact.  Direct effects are the results of the money initially spent in the study region by the business or organization being studied.  This includes money spent to pay for salaries, supplie",economics
Risk analysis (business),"Risk analysis is the process of identifying and assessing risks that may jeopardize an organization's success. It typically fits into a larger risk management framework.
Diligent risk analysis helps construct preventive measures to reduce the probability of incidents from occurring, as well as counter-measures to address incidents as they develop to minimize negative impacts on the organization.
A popular method to perform risk analysis on IT systems is called facilitated risk analysis process (FRAP).

Facilitated risk analysis process
FRAP analyzes one system, application or segment of business processes at a time.
FRAP assumes that additional efforts to develop precisely quantified risks are not cost-effective because:

such estimates are time-consuming
risk documentation becomes too voluminous for practical use
specific loss estimates are generally not needed to determine if controls are needed.
without assumptions, there is little risk analysis
After identifying and categorizing risks, a team identifies the controls that could mitigate the risk. The decision for what controls are needed lies with the business manager. The team's conclusions as to what risks exist and what controls needed are documented, along with a related action plan for control implementation.
Three of the most important risks a software company faces are: unexpected changes in revenue, unexpected changes in costs from those budgeted and the amount of specialization of the software planned. Risks that affect revenues can be: unanticipated competition, privacy, intellectual property right problems, and unit sales that are less than forecast. Unexpected development costs also create the risk that can be in the form of more rework than anticipated, security holes, and privacy invasions.
Narrow specialization of software with a large amount of research and development expenditures can lead to both business and technological risks since specialization does not necessarily lead to lower unit costs of software. Combined with the decrease in the potential customer base, specialization risk can be significant for a software firm. After probabilities of scenarios have been calculated with risk analysis, the process of risk management can be applied to help manage the risk.
Methods like applied information economics add to and improve on risk analysis methods by introducing procedures to adjust subjective probabilities, compute the value of additional information and to use the results in part of a larger portfolio management problem.

Upper Neretva,"Upper Neretva (Serbo-Croatian: Gornja Neretva), is the upper course of the Neretva river, including vast mountainous area surrounding the Neretva, with numerous human settlements, peaks and forests, numerous streams and well-springs, three major glacial lakes near the river and even more scattered across the mountains of Treskavica and Zelengora, in a wider area of the Upper Neretva with its flora and fauna.
Geographically and historically area has distinct features, while the Neretva is divided into three common hydrological sections: upper, middle and lower.
The Neretva has been harnessed and controlled to a large extent by four HE power-plants with large dams (as higher than 15 meters) and their storage lakes, but it still recognized for its natural beauty, diversity of its landscape and visual attractiveness.

Geography and hydrography
The Neretva is largest karst river in the Dinaric Alps in the entire eastern part of the Adriatic basin, which belongs to the Adriatic river watershed. The total length is 230 km, of which 208 km are in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the final 22 km are in the Dubrovnik-Neretva County of Croatia.
Geographically and hydrographical the Neretva is divided in three section.
The upper course of the Neretva river, called the Upper Neretva (Bosnian: Gornja Neretva), includes vast area around the Neretva, numerous streams and well-springs, three major glacial lakes near the very river and even more scattered across the mountains of Treskavica and Zelengora in wider area of the Upper Neretva, mountains, peaks and forests, flora and fauna of the area. All this natural heritage together with cultural heritage of Upper Neretva, representing rich and valuable resources of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Europe.

Course
The Neretva springs are situated deep in the Dinaric Alps at the base of the Zelengora and Lebršnik mountains under the village Jabuka and the saddle Gredelj. The Neretva headwaters run in undisturbed rapids and waterfalls, carving steep gorges reaching 600–800 meters in depth through this remote and rugged limestone terrain.
The upper course of Neretva, Upper Neretva (Bosnian: Gornja Neretva) has water of Class I purity and is almost certainly the coldest river water in the world, often as low as 7-8 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
First section, Upper Neretva, of the Neretva river from its source at 1,227 m.a.s.l. and headwaters gorge all the way to the town of Konjic is 90 km, flows from south to north-north-west as most of the Bosnia and Herzegovina rivers belonging to the Danube watershed, and cover some 1,390 km2 with average elevation of 1.2%.

Tahtib,"Tahtib (Egyptian Arabic: تحطيب, romanized: taḥṭīb) is the term for a traditional stick-fighting martial art originally named fan a'nazaha wa-tahtib (""the art of being straight and honest through the use of stick""). The original martial version of tahtib later evolved into an Egyptian folk dance with a wooden stick. It is commonly described in English as a ""stick dance"", ""cane dance"", ""stick-dancing game"", or as ritual mock combat accompanied by music. Nowadays, the word tahtib encompasses both martial practice and performance art. It is mainly practiced today in Upper Egypt. Tahtib is regularly performed for tourists in Luxor and Aswan.
The stick used in tahtib is about four feet in length and is called an asa, asaya, assaya, or nabboot. It is often flailed in large figure-eight patterns across the body with such speed that the displacement of air is loudly discernible.

History
The oldest traces of tahtib were found on engravings from the archaeological site of Abusir, an extensive necropolis of the Old Kingdom period, located in the south-western suburbs of Cairo. On some of the reliefs of the Pyramid of Sahure (V dynasty, c. 2500 BC); the images and explanatory captions are particularly precise and accurate in their depiction of what seems to be military training using sticks. Tahtib, with archery and wrestling, was then among the three disciplines of warfare taught to soldiers.

Three of the 35 tombs of the Beni Hassan necropolis (XI-XII Dynasties, 1900 – 1700 BC) near the town of Minya, contain engravings showing scenes of tahtib. Similar engravings can be seen in the archaeological site of Tell el Amarna (XVIII Dynasty, 1350 BC), some 60 km south of Minya. In addition to its role as military training, tahtib matches were also popular among peasants and farmers. The first evidence of the festive representation of tahtib can only be seen in the New Empire (1500 – 1000 BC), as shown by the engravings on the walls of Luxor and Saqqâra Early Christian writings mention tahtib as a leisure activity and a popular art performed by men during weddings and celebrations. It is believed that tahtib developed as a game or performance art in this civilian context.

Performance
As with its combative counterpart, the dance form of tahtib was originally performed by men, but female versions were later developed. In one form, the women dress as men and imitate the males. Another female variant is performed flirtatiously and with less aggression. The latter, called ra's el assaya (dance of the stick) is incorporated into cabaret or Raqs sharqi performances. The stick used for this dance is generally more lightweight and hooked at one end like a cane. It is often embellished with metallic-coloured foil or sequins. The costume is a simple baladi dress. Performances include balancing the cane on the head, hip or shoulder.

Music
Music in tahtib features the tabl (bass drum) and mizmar (folk oboe). The right hand uses a heavier stick with a hooked head to beat out",sports
Applied anthropology research methods,"Anthropology is the study of human societal and cultural development in the past, present, and future with a number of facets that are categorized into five different fields. These fields include: biological (physical) anthropology, cultural (socio-cultural) anthropology, linguistic anthropology (linguistics), archaeology, and applied anthropology. Applied anthropology is the analysis of human interaction with the purpose of solving practical problems that affect and arise throughout time between cultures and societies. Applied anthropologists use many different methods to conduct research on agriculture, health and medicine, housing, social services, political-economic development, displacement and resettlement, business and industry, education, nutrition, environment, and aging. Applied anthropology research methods are: policy research, evaluation research, cultural intervention, activist (action) research, participatory action research (PAR).

Background and history
Applied anthropology was first established in the 19th century in Europe and continued to expand to other cultures around the world. Applied anthropology was first seen in North America by the Mexican government in 1917 and continues to grow. Applied anthropology was more prevalent after WWII, this was due to the loss of Britain's occupations in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. These regions were under British rule until the 1930s, and once that ended, societal and practical problems began to be observed. In 1941 in America, the Society of Applied Anthropology was established to further the practice of applied anthropology and created many projects to accumulate data. One of the most important and influential anthropologists, Franz Boas, was a pioneer in applied research methods and practices.
Boas was born 1858 and died in 1942. He contributed many practices and studies towards applied anthropology and is often referred to as the ""Father of Modern Anthropology"". Boas was one of the first to look at anthropology as a science and as a means of understanding the different cultures and people around the world. Prior anthropologists were likely artifact hunters and had no regard for the cultures that they were encountering. Some of Boas' work consisted of teaching and fieldwork, as well as six different trips to study the migratory movements of the Inuit, starting in 1886. Another important application of Boas was the four field discipline of anthropology in which  he proclaimed that all sub-fields together were needed to paint an accurate picture of anthropological research.
Other anthropologists made contributions to early modern anthropology, like Bronislaw Malinowski, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. Malinowski's studies contributed the functional theory or functionalism, which is the idea that no matter the culture or civilization, societal institutions exist to help the individual meet their needs. Mead contributed to the idea of cultural determinism, which is the idea that cul",science
Christianity in the ante-Nicene period,"Christianity in the ante-Nicene period was the time in Christian history up to the First Council of Nicaea. This article covers the period following the Apostolic Age of the first century, c. 100 AD, to Nicaea in 325 AD.
The second and third centuries saw a sharp divorce of Christianity from its early roots. There was an explicit rejection of then-modern Judaism and Jewish culture by the end of the second century, with a growing body of adversus Judaeos literature. Fourth- and fifth-century Christianity experienced pressure from the government of the Roman Empire and developed strong episcopal and unifying structure. Many variations in this era defy neat categorizations, as various forms of Christianity interacted in a complex fashion. One variation was proto-orthodoxy which became the international Great Church and in this period was defended by the Apostolic Fathers. This was the tradition of Pauline Christianity, which placed importance on the death of Jesus as saving humanity, and described Jesus as God come to Earth. Another major school of thought was Gnostic Christianity, which placed importance on the wisdom of Jesus saving humanity, and described Jesus as a human who became divine through knowledge.
While the Jewish Christian church was centered in Jerusalem in the first century, Gentile Christianity became decentralized in the second century. Various local and provincial ancient church councils were held during this period, with the decisions meeting varying degrees of acceptance by different Christian groups. Major figures of the second century who were later declared by the developing proto-orthodoxy to be heretics were Marcion, Valentinus, and Montanus.
Although the use of the term Christian is attested in the Acts of the Apostles (80–90 AD), the earliest recorded use of the term Christianity (Greek: Χριστιανισμός) is by Ignatius of Antioch about 107 AD.

Beliefs
Eschatology
The predominant eschatological view in the Ante-Nicene period was Premillennialism, the belief of a visible reign of Christ in glory on earth with the risen saints for a thousand years, before the general resurrection and judgment. Justin Martyr and Irenaeus were the most outspoken proponents of premillennialism. Justin Martyr saw himself as continuing in the “Jewish” belief of a temporary messianic kingdom prior to the eternal state. Irenaeus devoted Book V of his Against Heresies to a defense of the physical resurrection and eternal judgement.
Other early premillennialists included Pseudo-Barnabas, Papias, Methodius, Lactantius, Commodianus Theophilus, Tertullian,  Melito, Hippolytus of Rome and Victorinus of Pettau. 
By the third century there was growing opposition to premillennialism. Origen was the first to challenge the doctrine openly. Dionysius of Alexandria stood against premillennialism when the chiliastic work, The Refutation of the Allegorizers by Nepos, a bishop in Egypt, became popular in Alexandria, as noted in Eusebius's, Ecclesiastical History.

Further, a new offshore site at Casablanca, with state-of-the-art technologies and other incentives, has grabbed the attention of many global multinationals. Setting up offshore service centers in the nation has become tempting. Such is the rate of growth, that off-shoring and IT activities are estimated to contribute $500 million to the country's GDP and employ 30,000 people by 2015. The communications sector  already accounts for half of all foreign direct investments Morocco received over the past five years.

IT sector
The IT sector generated a turnover of Dh7bn ($910,000m) in 2007, which represented an 11% increase compared to 2006. The number of Moroccan internet subscribers in 2007 amounted to 526,080, representing an increase of 31.6% compared to the previous year and a 100% increase compared to 2005. The national penetration for internet subscription remains low, even though it increased from 0.38% in 2004 to 1.72% in 2007. Yet over 90% of subscribers have a broadband ADSL connection, which is one of the highest ratios in the world. While the telecoms sector remains the big earner, with Dh33bn ($4.3bn), the IT and off shore industries should generate Dh21bn ($2.7bn) each by 2012. In addition, the number of employees should increase from 40,000 to 125,000. The government hopes that adding more local content to the internet will increase usage. There have also been efforts to add more computers to schools and universities. E-commerce is likely to take off in the next few years, especially as the use of credit cards is gaining more ground in Morocco. Although computer and internet use have made a great leap forward in the past five years, the IT market still finds itself in infancy and offers great potential for further development.

Telecommunications
The mobile telephony segment comprises three operators: Maroc Telecom, the former state-owned company, with a market share of 58.2 per cent in 2008. Méditel (31.5 per cent) and, since April 2007, Wana (10.4 per cent).  Maroc Telecom is expected to lose 12 per cent of the mobile market share. The mobile telephony market is growing rapidly, the number of subscribers reached 22.3 million in September 2008. In 2008, over 64 per cent of the population had more than one mobile phone in their households, compared to 48 per cent in 2005. The introduction of customer loyalty plans, the downward trend in prices and the enhancement of service offerings over the last two years have further boosted mobile telephony. As of June 2008, the mobile penetration rate had risen to 69.4 per cent, as against 57.8 per cent in June 2007.
In the fixed-line telephony segment, 3G telecommunications licences have been granted to two operators, Méditel and Wana. The data on ",technology
Denazification,"Denazification (German: Entnazifizierung) was an Allied initiative to rid German and Austrian society, culture, press, economy, judiciary, and politics of the Nazi ideology following the Second World War. It was carried out by removing those who had been Nazi Party or SS members from positions of power and influence, by disbanding or rendering impotent the organizations associated with Nazism, and by trying prominent Nazis for war crimes in the Nuremberg trials of 1946. The program of denazification was launched after the end of the war and was solidified by the Potsdam Agreement in August 1945. The term denazification was first coined as a legal term in 1943 by the Pentagon, intended to be applied in a narrow sense with reference to the post-war German legal system. However, it later took on a broader meaning.
In late 1945 and early 1946, the emergence of the Cold War and the economic importance of Germany caused the United States in particular to lose interest in the program, somewhat mirroring the Reverse Course in American-occupied Japan. The British handed over denazification panels to the Germans in January 1946, while the Americans did likewise in March 1946. The French ran the mildest denazification effort. Denazification was carried out in an increasingly lenient and lukewarm way until being officially abolished in 1951. Additionally, the program was hugely unpopular in West Germany, where many Nazis maintained positions of power. Denazification was opposed by the new West German government of Konrad Adenauer, who declared that ending the process was necessary for West German rearmament. On the other hand, denazification in East Germany was considered a critical element of the transformation into a socialist society, and the country was stricter in opposing Nazism than its counterpart. However, not all former Nazis faced judgment. Doing special tasks for the occupation governments could protect Nazi members from prosecution, enabling them to continue working and in some cases reach prominence, as did special connections with the occupiers. One of the most notable cases involved Wernher von Braun, who was among other German scientists recruited by the United States through Operation Paperclip and later occupied key positions in the American space program.

Overview
About 8 million Germans, or 10% of the population, had been members of the Nazi Party. Nazi-related organizations also had huge memberships, such as the German Labor Front (25 million), the National Socialist People's Welfare organization (17 million), the League of German Women, and others. It was through the Party and these organizations that the Nazi state was run, involving as many as 45 million Germans in total. In addition, Nazism found significant support among industrialists, who produced weapons or used slave labor, and large landowners, especially the Junkers in Prussia. Denazification after the surrender of Germany was thus an enormous undertaking, fraught with many ",politics
Metal Age (Southeast Asia),"In the archaeology of Maritime Southeast Asia, the Metal Age is the period between roughly 2000 and 500 years ago. The internal chronology of the period is still debated, but it is often divided into 'early', 'developed' and 'proto-historic' phases. Unlike in the conventional three-age system used in other parts of Eurasia, archaeologists do not divide the Metal Age into a Bronze Age and Iron Age, because bronze and iron metallurgy arrived in Maritime Southeast Asia at roughly the same time.

Rec footy,"Recreational Football (also known as Rec Footy or Recreational Footy) was a non-contact version of the Australian rules football game first played in 2003 and later sanctioned by the Australian Football League's game development arm, it was inspired heavily by the growing popularity of tag rugby (in Australia known as Oztag). It was a more accessible version of Australian rules football that people could pick up and play. It was a mixed competition, with eight players on each team, accessible to players of both sexes, all shapes and sizes and requires minimal equipment to play. Rec Footy was criticised mainly by Australian rules players for appearing similar to netball and being too restrictive, lacking of ability for skilled footballers to run kick and play naturally whilst also penalising newer unskilled players with frequent turnovers.
The AFL ceased promoting Rec Footy in 2011 officially replacing it with AFL 9s in 2016. AFL 9s is essentially similar but rebranded game which responded to many of the criticisms of Rec Footy to make it more similar to the traditional football. The obvious differences being the number of players and the equipment which were not popular aspects of Rec Footy. In AFL 9s tags are no long used in favour of umpiring touch similarly to touch football, bibs were replaced by more traditional football apparel, players are able to move more freely, run and bounce, evade players (with limitations) and kick longer but with specialist goal kickers signified by wrist bands. Maximum participation is encouraged through mixed and gender specific competitions. In mixed competition, female players are distributed across each zone to give players an equal opportunity to kick goals.

Comparisons with Australian rules football
Field size, number of players and duration of play
Rec Footy teams were much smaller than Australian Rules Football, with two teams of 8.  Unlike Australian Rules Football, unlimited number of interchange players were allowed.
The field is also much smaller than an Australian Rules Football oval, consisting of a rectangular surface with a maximum length of 100 metres by 50 metres wide.
Games were much shorter and do not consist of quarters, with only two 20 minute halves.

Rule differences to encourage female participation
The game encourages female participation, with a minimum of 3 female players per mixed side.  In addition, teams were encouraged to play females in the forward line, with a goal kicked by a female worth 3 more points (9) than a goal kicked by a male player (6).
The game is played with a modified Australian rules ball, which is the same size but prevents it from being kicked long distances to suit the reduced ground size and reduce the kicking advantage of males over females.

Rule differences to prevent physical contact
Unlike Australian rules football, there is no contesting for possession with the exception of removing a player's tag, which substitutes for a tackle and gives the player 3 sec",sports
Agrarian studies,"An agrarian society, or agricultural society, is any community whose economy is based on producing and maintaining crops and farmland. Another way to define an agrarian society is by seeing how much of a nation's total production is in agriculture. In  agrarian society, cultivating the land is the primary source of wealth. Such a society may acknowledge other means of livelihood and work habits but stresses the importance of agriculture and farming. Agrarian societies have existed in various parts of the world as far back as 10,000 years ago and continue to exist today. They have been the most common form of socio-economic organization for most of recorded human history.

History
Agrarian society were preceded by hunters and gatherers and horticultural societies and transition into industrial society. The transition to agriculture, called the Neolithic Revolution, has taken place independently multiple times. Horticulture and agriculture as types of subsistence developed among humans somewhere between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East. The reasons for the development of agriculture are debated but may have included climate change, and the accumulation of food surplus for competitive gift-giving. Most certainly there was a gradual transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural economies after a lengthy period when some crops were deliberately planted and other foods were gathered from the wild. An example of this transition can be found in the cultivation of wild cereals by hunter-gatherers in the Central Sahara. Between 7500 BCE and 3500 BCE, undomesticated central Saharan flora were farmed, stored, and cooked, and domesticated animals (e.g., Barbary sheep) were milked and managed, by hunter-gatherers near the Takarkori rockshelter, which is representative of the broader Sahara; this continued until the beginning of the Pastoral Neolithic in the Sahara. In addition to the emergence of farming in the Fertile Crescent, agriculture appeared: by at least 6,800 BCE in East Asia (rice) and, later, in Central and South America (maize and squash). Small-scale agriculture also likely arose independently in early Neolithic contexts in India (rice) and Southeast Asia (taro). However, full dependency on domestic crops and animals, when wild resources contributed a nutritionally insignificant component to the diet, did not occur until the Bronze Age.
Agriculture allows a much greater density of population than can be supported by hunting and gathering and allows for the accumulation of excess product to keep for winter use or to sell for profit. The ability of farmers to feed large numbers of people whose activities have nothing to do with material production was the crucial factor in the rise of surplus, specialization, advanced technology, hierarchical social structures, inequality, and standing armies. Agrarian societies thus support the emergence of a more complex social structure.
In agrarian societies, some of",economics
Swabia,"Swabia is a cultural, historic and linguistic region in southwestern Germany. 
The name is ultimately derived from the medieval Duchy of Swabia, one of the German stem duchies, representing the historic settlement area of the  Germanic tribe alliances named Alemanni and Suebi.
This territory would include all of the Alemannic German area, but the modern concept of Swabia is more restricted, due to the collapse of the duchy of Swabia in the thirteenth century. Swabia as understood in modern ethnography roughly coincides with the Swabian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire as it stood during the early modern period, now divided between the states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg.
Swabians (Schwaben, singular Schwabe) are the natives of Swabia and speakers of Swabian German. Their number was estimated at close to 0.8 million by SIL Ethnologue as of 2006, compared to a total population of 7.5 million in the regions of Tübingen, Stuttgart and Bavarian Swabia.

Geography
Like many cultural regions of Europe, Swabia's borders are not clearly defined. However, today it is normally thought of as comprising the former Swabian Circle, or equivalently the former state of Württemberg (with the Prussian Hohenzollern Province), or the modern districts of Tübingen (excluding the former Baden regions of the Bodenseekreis district), Stuttgart, and the administrative region of Bavarian Swabia.
In the Middle Ages, the term Swabia indicated a larger area, covering all the lands associated with the Frankish stem duchy of Alamannia stretching from the Vosges Mountains in the west to the broad Lech river in the east:

History
Early history
Like all of Southern Germany, what is now Swabia was part of the La Tène culture, and as such has a Celtic (Gaulish) substrate. In the Roman era, it was part of the Raetia province.
The name Suebia is derived from that of the Suebi.
It is used already by Tacitus in the 1st century, albeit in a different geographical sense:
He calls the Baltic Sea the Mare Suevicum (""Suebian Sea"") after the Suiones, and ends his description of the Suiones and Sitones with ""Here Suebia ends"" (Hic Suebiae finis).
By the mid-3rd century, groups of the Suebi form the core element of the new tribal alliance known as the Alamanni, who expanded towards the Roman Limes east of the Rhine and south of the Main.
The Alamanni were sometimes referred to as Suebi even at this time, and their new area of settlement came to be known as Suebia.
In the migration period, the Suebi (Alamanni) crossed the Rhine in 406 and some of them established the Kingdom of the Suebi in Galicia. Another group settled in parts of Pannonia, after the Huns were defeated in 454 in the Battle of Nedao.
The Alemanni were ruled by independent kings throughout the 4th to 5th centuries but fell under Frankish domination in the 6th (Battle of Tolbiac 496).
By the late 5th century, the area settled by the Alemanni extended to Alsace and the Swiss Plateau, bordering on the Bavarii to the east, the Fra",history
Austus,"Austus was a variation of Australian rules football which was played in Australia during World War II between Australians and visiting soldiers from the United States. The name comes from the first four letters of Australia (AUST) and the initials of the United States (US).
The game is played with a gridiron ball and features both punting and forward passing, with Australian rules football style marking providing the opportunity for a free kick or throw and the absence of an offside rule.

Background
Sports exhibitions by servicemen from both the Australian and visiting American services were commonplace during World War II as fundraisers, including American football. However, it was not possible for teams from Australia and America to play against each other in either of their national football codes due to the differences in skills: Australians were not adept at long throws of the ball, as was common in American football, and Americans were not adept at kicking, particularly on the run, as was required to play Australian rules football.
To enable football competitions between Australians and Americans, a modified code was proposed. Although sometimes described as a hybrid between the Australian and American codes, creator Ern Cowley described it as ""99% Australian rules with the addition of gridiron highlights"". The only significant rule change from the Australian game was that the American football-style forward pass was allowed and afforded the same benefits as an Australian rules football kick. Therefore, a ball thrown over a distance of at least ten yards could be marked if caught on the full; and goals could be scored from throws, with the exception that a thrown goal must have been from a distance greater than twenty yards – an arc twenty yards from the goal line was painted on the field to enable this to be judged by umpires. The game was played with an American football rather than an Australian football, because the pointed design of the American ball meant that it could be both thrown and kicked. These rules enabled Americans to participate against Australians at Australian rules football using the ball skills they already possessed from playing American football.
The first game of Austus was played on 18 July 1943 at Punt Road Oval between a team of US Servicemen and an Australian Explosives Factory team over two 25-minute halves. The Americans won 8.4 (52) to 5.8 (38). Two weeks later, an Australian team including around twelve VFL players comfortably defeated the Americans 17.23 (125) d. 8.1 (49) in a full-length game. Archival footage of the game exists (Video on YouTube), exhibiting American players preference to run and forward pass the ball.
Several more games were played as exhibitions in 1943 and 1944. By the end of 1943, both countries' armed forces endorsed the game as a suitable activity for their troops, with the rules later published in official army publications. The US Army noted that the game was more suited to warmer",sports
Indigenous economics,"Indigenous economics is a field of economic study that explores the economic systems, practices, theories, and philosophies unique to indigenous peoples. This approach to economics examines how such groups understand, interact with, and manage resources within their specific cultural contexts. Indigenous economics puts emphasis on communal values, sustainability, and connection with land and environment.

History
Indigenous economics emerged in the latter half of the 20th century as scholars attempted to gain a broader understanding of the ways actual economies operated in places that had not adopted markets or government control as the primary approach to managing economic activity. Globalization, colonialism, and sustainability are among the economic trends that affect such contexts.

Concepts
Indigenous economics is rooted in the beliefs, norms, and values of individual indigenous communities. Certain concepts often arise:

Communal ownership and resource management: Resources such as land and water are often managed communally, with an emphasis on collective responsibility and stewardship.
Sustainability and long-term planning: Indigenous economic systems typically prioritize sustainability and ecological balance. Economic decisions consider long-term impacts on the community and the environment.
Reciprocity and redistribution: Economic interactions often involve principles of reciprocity and redistribution.
Holistic Approach: Indigenous economics consider economy activity in the context of cultural, spiritual, social, and environmental concerns.

Anthropocene Working Group,"The Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) is an interdisciplinary research group dedicated to the study of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit. It was established in 2009 as part of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS), a constituent body of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). As of 2021, the research group features 37 members, with the physical geographer Simon Turner as Secretary and the geologist Colin Neil Waters as chair of the group. The late Nobel Prize-winning Paul Crutzen, who popularized the word 'Anthropocene' in 2000, had also been a member of the group until he died on January 28, 2021. The main goal of the AWG is providing scientific evidence robust enough for the Anthropocene to be formally ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) as an epoch within the Geologic time scale.

History
Prior to the establishment of the Anthropocene Working Group in 2009, no research program dedicated to the formalization of the Anthropocene in the geologic time scale existed. The idea of naming the current epoch 'Anthropocene' rather than using its formal time unit, the Holocene, became popular after Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer published in May 2000 an article on the IGBP Global Change Newsletter called ""The 'Anthropocene'."" Later in 2002, Crutzen published a commentary on Nature titled ""Geology of Mankind"" where he further stressed the idea ""to assign the term ‘Anthropocene’ to the present, in many ways human-dominated, geological epoch, supplementing the Holocene,"" with starting date in the late 18th century (at the onset of the Industrial Revolution). Soon after Paul Crutzen published his influential articles, a debate over the beginning of the Anthropocene took place between supporters of the Early Anthropocene Hypothesis, a thesis originally promoted in 2003 by the palaeoclimatologist William Ruddiman dating the beginning of the Anthropocene as far back as the Neolithic Revolution, and supporters of more recent starting dates, from  European Colonization of the Americas, to the late 18th century, to the post-WWII Great Acceleration.
The discussion over the beginning of the Anthropocene was crucial for the 'stratigraphic turn' that the Anthropocene debate took in the following years. In February 2008, Jan Zalasiewicz and other members of the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London published a paper that considered the possibility to ""amplify and extend the discussion of the effects referred to by Crutzen and then apply the same criteria used to set up new epochs to ask whether there really is justification or need for a new term, and if so, where and how its boundary might be placed."" The article raised the possibility of studying the Anthropocene as a discrete geological unit—a possibility that later led to the establishment of the AWG.
In 2009, the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy established an Anthropocene Working Group to ""examine the status, hierarchica",science

The arts and politics,"A strong relationship between the arts and politics, particularly between various kinds of art and power, occurs across historical epochs and cultures.  As they respond to contemporaneous events and politics, the arts take on political as well as social dimensions, becoming themselves a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as social change.
A widespread observation is that a great talent has a free spirit. For instance Pushkin, who some scholars regard as Russia's first great writer, is said to have attracted the irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar, since he ""instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings (if write he must), composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants.""

History of art
According to Groys, ""Art has its own power in the world, and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics.""

Social and political change
Pertaining to such politically-intractable phenomena as the Modern conflicts in the Middle East, however, some artists and social critics believe that ""art is useless as a tool for political change."" There are, nevertheless, examples where artists employ art in the service of political change.

Role of poetry
Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.
The Italian poet Ungaretti, when interviewed on transgression by director Pasolini for the 1964 Love Meetings documentary, said that the foundation of poetry is to transgress all laws.
The recitation of powerful, pithy poetry is a popular art form at American protests and political rallies. From the civil rights, women’s liberation, gay rights, and Puerto Rican Independence movements to Black Lives Matter, poetry is used to build emotional unity in crowds and draw media attention. Giannina Braschi wrote, ""Poets and anarchists are always the first to go. Where? To the frontline. Wherever it is."" Protest poems include Gwendolyn Brooks ""Riot"", Allen Ginsberg's Howl, Tato Laviera's ""Lady Liberty"", Nikki Giovanni's ""Rosa Parks"", Amiri Baraka's ""Short Speech to My Friends,"" and Jill McDonough's ""Dear Gaybashers"".  Beat poet Allen Ginsberg was arrested at an antiwar demonstration in New York City in 1967 and tear-gassed at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968.

Digital ecology,"Digital ecology is a science about the interdependence of digital systems and the natural environment. This field of study looks at the methods in which digital technologies are changing the way how people interact with the environment, as well as how these technologies affects the environment itself. It is a branch of ecology that promotes green practices to fight digital pollution. Currently the total carbon footprint of the internet, our electronic devices, and supporting elements accounts for about 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions (including about 1.4 per cent of overall global carbon dioxide emissions).
Digital Ecology can also be used to denote the use of technology in the study of ecological systems and processing, examining how technological developments aid in the collection, analysis and management of ecological data. Important fields in this aspect of Digital Ecology include the development of drone technology for wildlife monitoring.
Digital ecology is a complex and multifaceted field that requires a holistic approach to understanding the relationship between digital technologies and the natural world. With the increasing reliance on digital technologies, it is important to consider the environmental consequences of these technologies and work towards more sustainable solutions.

Negative impact on the environment
One of the main areas of focus in digital ecology is the impact of electronic waste, or e-waste. As more and more devices become obsolete and are replaced with newer models, the amount of e-waste being produced is increasing at an alarming rate. This e-waste often ends up in landfills, where it can leach harmful chemicals into the soil and water supply.
Another aspect of digital ecology is the energy consumption of digital technologies and the digital pollution in causes. The production and use of digital devices requires significant amounts of energy, and as the demand for these devices increases, so does the amount of energy required to meet this demand.. The total carbon footprint of the internet, our electronic devices, and supporting elements add up to about 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is as much as for the airline industry and the number keeps on rising. This increase in energy consumption has a negative impact on the environment, as it contributes to climate change and air pollution. Research has shown, that if the internet was a country, it would be the seventh largest polluter in the world, by some estimates.

Digital pollution
Digital pollution is a crucial aspect of digital ecology. It is the main problem against which digital ecology is fighting. Digital pollution refers to the negative impact of digital technology and electronic waste on the environment and human health. This can include emissions from electronic devices, toxic chemicals in electronic waste, and the proliferation of e-waste in landfills.
Technology users contribute to digital pollution on a daily basis, which include:

Medicine selling channel,"Medicine selling channel is a slang term for some radio and television stations in mainland China. These radio and television stations got their name from the large number of ""medical programs"" (which are actually advertisements, almost all of which are false advertisements, mostly to promote drugs that can treat various incurable diseases).

Origin
In recent years, with the development of cable television, digital television and the Internet, the public's access to information has been increasing. However, many radio and television stations have become drug-selling stations due to the monotony of programming (one of the reasons is the lack of government funding) and the dwindling audience, especially in second- and third-tier cities or county-level radio and television stations, and there are also a few underground radio stations.

Features
Drug sales programs mostly appear as health and medical featured programs. The content usually includes self-proclaimed ""expert"" and ""director"" (「主任」) presenters introduce the efficacy of drugs or health products, and ""patients"" calling in to consult or confirm the efficacy.

Hot stab,"A hot stab is a type of subsea connector specifically designed to be easily inserted and removed by a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) manipulator arm. The hot stab is the connector which supplies remote utilities. It is normally inserted into a port after removing the plug stab, which is left in the port when the hot stab is disconnected, to keep the port clean and free of fouling when not in use. The alignment is generally not critical for insertion, and the stab is guided into the port by the port geometry, which tends to be concentric cylinder and cone sections, tapering down from the handle end to the tip, with a series of O-ring seals separating the ports or contacts spaced along the length. The stab may be locked into place or may require the ROV to hold it in place while it is in use.

Purpose
A hot stab provides a temporary pressure-tight connection between an external service and a subsea installation, which can be used for a wide variety of applications.
Some operations require low to medium flow rates for a short period to operate a mechanism from one position to another. These may be called static applications. Other operations need continuous medium or high flow rates.

Applications
Hydraulic – Used for hydraulic control fluids to operate valves, connectors, actuators, clamps, pumps and other systems.
Chemical injection.
Electrical power and communication connections.
Multifunction hot stabs combine two or more of these services in one connector unit.
Bell umbilical services may use a hot stab type connector for emergency services.
There are types defined by geometry and port specifications.

Components
The stab plate is a fixed position part on the subsea structure
The receptacle is the part on the structure into which the hot stab is inserted. It receives and secures the hot stab and contains the static set of ports or contacts.
The stab is the mobile component that is inserted into the receptacle by the ROV or diver. The stab which carries the services is the hot stab (or live stab), and the plug stab is an unserviced component of the same basic geometry used to close the receptacle when not in use, to keep out detritus and prevent growth of marine fouling, and to keep water out of hydraulic systems.
The seals prevent leakage to the environment and between ports under high pressures. The seals may be pressure balanced to prevent separation forces.
Alignment aids may include a guide nose, funnel, bucket, and latches, to facilitate precise alignment of the stab and receptacle.
The stab is connected to hoses and/or cables to supply fluids or electrical power or signals to the appropriate ports or contacts. of the receptacle.
The handle allows the ROV or diver to grip, manipulate and move the stab.
Non-return valves may be used in the stab or receptacle to prevent loss of fluids to the environment.

Political base,"In politics, a candidate or party's base or core support refers to the voters who support them for elected office based on core values. On the left-right political spectrum, left-leaning bases tend to be liberal while right-leaning bases tend to be conservative. In the United States, high-level candidates must hold the same stances on key issues as a party's base in order to gain the party's nomination and thus be guaranteed ballot access. In the case of legislative elections, base voters often prefer to support their party's candidate against an otherwise appealing opponent in order to strengthen their party's chances of gaining a majority in the legislature.

Cultural conservatism,"Cultural conservatism is described as the protection of the cultural heritage of a nation state, or of a culture not defined by state boundaries. It is sometimes associated with criticism of multiculturalism, anti-immigration sentiment, and opposition to illegal immigration. Because their cultural preservationist objectives are in conflict with those of anti-racists, cultural conservatives are often accused of racism. Despite this, however, cultural conservatism can be more nuanced in its approach to minority languages and cultures; it is sometimes focused upon heritage language learning or threatened language revitalization, such as of the distinctive local dialect of French in Quebec, Acadian French, Canadian Gaelic, and the Mi'kmaq language in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, or the Irish language in Newfoundland. Other times cultural conservatism is more focused upon the preservation of an ethnic minority's endangered ancestral culture, such as those of Native Americans.
In the United States, cultural conservatism may imply a conservative position in the culture wars. Because cultural conservatism expresses the social dimension of conservatism according to the political compass theory, it is sometimes referred to as social conservatism. Instead, social conservatism describes conservative moral and social values, or traditionalist conservative stances on socio-cultural issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, in opposition to cultural liberalism (social liberalism in the United States). Meanwhile, nationalism also differs from cultural conservatism as it does not always focus upon a particular culture.

Arguments
In favor
Proponents argue that cultural conservatism preserves the cultural identity of a country. They often promote assimilation into the dominant culture, believing that monoculturalism is more constructive to national unity. They claim that assimilation facilitates the integration of immigrants and ethnic minorities into broader society, framing cultural conservatism as a solution to ethnic strife. Researchers note that the more culturally homogeneous a community is, the more people trust each other. Trust was shown to decrease in more culturally diverse areas.
Proponents of cultural conservatism have criticized multiculturalism, believing that cultural pluralism is detrimental to a unified national identity. They argue that cultural diversity only serves to marginalize immigrants by othering them as outsiders in society. In some countries multiculturalism is believed to create de facto racial segregation in the form of ethnic enclaves. Opposition to immigration is also a common stance among proponents. Immigrants often bring the cultures, religions, and languages of their home countries with them, sometimes influencing and changing the cultures of their host countries. Proponents of cultural conservatism argue that some of these imported cultural practices, such as hijabs, polygamy, child marriage, and female genital mutilat",politics
Conviction politics,"Conviction politics is the practice of campaigning based on a politician's own fundamental values or ideas rather than attempting to represent an existing consensus or simply take positions that are popular in polls. On the political right, the term has been adopted by politicians like Margaret Thatcher, who declared ""I am not a consensus politician. I am a conviction politician"" in 1979, a few months before her election as prime minister.

Theory
There are a number of arguments for conviction politics. One is that it is more honest; conviction politicians simply say what they believe rather than shading their opinions to be more palatable to their audience. Another is that by voicing strong opinions, they push public debate forward and promote a genuine discussion of political issues. Even if the candidates lose, they will have promoted their particular political ideas and persuaded some voters of their value. There are also more instrumental reasons. By arguing forcefully for their positions during the campaign, politicians are more able to pursue the goals once in office. Also, proponents argue that conviction politicians are more likely to win. When he was a candidate, Tom Perriello stated: ""More often, the deepest connection with another person comes from when I disagree with them and admit it, because at least they know I will tell the truth. While some strategists focus on positioning candidates on issue after issue, I believe most voters focus more on whether the candidate integrity and character on the whole, demonstrated by the conviction to take a stand.""
By saying what they believe and ignoring the polls, conviction politicians distinguish themselves from other politicians. Democratic Party politician and senator Paul Wellstone frequently heard voters tell him: ""I don't always agree with you, but I like it that I know where you stand."" He found that when he announced his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, an unpopular position at the time, he jumped to a five-point lead in the polls. In the United States, 87% of voters in one poll said they think politicians are ""pretty much willing to say whatever it takes in order to get themselves elected"".

History
Thatcher, like her contemporary Ronald Reagan in the United States, argued that her leadership should be a time for big, bold changes, grounded in the central principles of her ideology. ""It was not a set of policies cobbled together from minute to minute, begged, borrowed or stolen from other people,"" she said while describing her government. ""It was successful because it was based on clear, firmly-held principles."" A devout Methodist, she further defended the principles as being grounded in the Christian Bible: ""I believe that by taking together these key elements from the Old and New Testaments, we gain a view of the universe, a proper attitude to work and principles to shape economic and social life. We are told we must work and use our talents to create wealth.""

Periodization,"In historiography, periodization is the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete, quantified, and named blocks of time for the purpose of study or analysis. This is usually done to understand current and historical processes, and the causality that might have linked those events.
Periodizations can provide a convenient segmentation of time, wherein events within the period might consist of relatively similar characteristics. However, determining the precise beginning and ending of any 'period' is often arbitrary, since it has changed over time and over the course of history. Systems of periodization are more or less arbitrary, yet it provides a framework to help us understand them. Periodizing labels are continually challenged and redefined, but once established, period ""brands"" are so convenient that many are hard to change.

History
The practice of dividing history into ages or periods is as early as the development of writing, and can be traced to the Sumerian 
 period. The Sumerian King List, dating to the second millennium BC—and for most parts it is not considered historically accurate—is ""periodized"" into dynastic regnal eras. The classical division into a Golden Age, Silver Age, Bronze Age, Heroic Age, and Iron Age goes back to Hesiod in the 8th – 7th century BC.
One Biblical periodization scheme commonly used in the Middle Ages was Saint Paul's theological division of history into three ages: the first before the age of Moses (under nature); the second under Mosaic law (under law); the third in the age of Christ (under grace). But perhaps the most widely discussed periodization scheme of the Middle Ages was the Six Ages of the World, written by the early 5th century AD, where every age was a thousand years counting from Adam to the present, with the present time (in the Middle Ages) being the sixth and final age.

Background
Periodizing blocks might overlap, conflict or contradict one another. Some have a cultural usage (the ""Gilded Age""), others refer to prominent historical events ('the Interwar period), while others are defined by decimal numbering systems ('the 1960s', 'the 17th century'). Other periods are named from influential individuals (the 'Napoleonic Era', the 'Victorian Era', and the 'Porfiriato').
Some of these usages will also be geographically specific. This is especially true of periodizing labels derived from individuals or ruling dynasties, such as the Jacksonian Era in America, the Meiji Era in Japan, or the Merovingian Period in France. Cultural terms may also have a limited reach. Thus the concept of the ""Romantic period"" is largely meaningless outside the Western world of Europe and European-influenced cultures. Likewise, 'the 1960s', though technically applicable to anywhere in the world according to Common Era numbering, has a certain set of specific cultural connotations in certain countries. For this reason, it may be possible to say such things as ""The 1960s never occurred in Spain"". This would ",history
Economic ethics,"Economic ethics is the combination of economics and ethics, incorporating both disciplines to predict, analyze, and model economic phenomena.
It can be summarised as the theoretical ethical prerequisites and foundations of economic systems. This principle can be traced back to the Greek philosopher Aristotle, whose Nicomachean Ethics describes the connection between objective economic principles and the consideration of justice. The academic literature on economic ethics is extensive, citing natural law and religious law as influences on the rules of economics. The consideration of moral philosophy, or a moral economy, differs from behavioural economic models. The standard creation, application, and beneficiaries of economic models present a trilemma when ethics are considered. These ideas, in conjunction with the assumption of rationality in economics, create a link between economics and ethics.

History
Ancient times
India
Ancient Indian economic thought revolved around the interplay between happiness, ethics, and economic values, recognizing their collective role in shaping human existence.[1] The Upanishads’ core principles—transcendental unity, oneness, and stability—are derived from this philosophical relationship.[2] Ancient Indian philosophy also demonstrates an early understanding of several modern economic concepts, such as the regulation of demand when it exceeded supply to prevent societal disorder. This was achieved by emphasizing that true happiness stemmed from non-material wealth, mirroring Alfred Marshall’s principle of the insatiability of wants.[1]
The Rig Veda acknowledges economic inequality in Chapter 10, stating: “The riches of the liberal never waste away, while he who will not give finds no comfort in them.” This suggests that wealth accumulation was not inherently immoral, but hoarding it was considered a sin.[1] Similarly, the Arthashastra established laws promoting economic efficiency within an ethical framework. Its author, Kautilya, argued that infrastructure development—primarily the responsibility of the king—was a key driver of economic growth, provided it was carried out in a morally sound manner.

Greece
Ancient Greek philosophers intricately linked economic teachings with ethical systems. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle held that happiness (eudaimonia) was the highest good humans could pursue. 
This perspective presented challenges in reconciling ethics with economics, particularly regarding the role of pleasure in achieving happiness.
Callicles, a character in Plato's ""Gorgias,"" argued that living rightly involves gratifying all desires through courage and practicality, advocating for the unrestrained satisfaction of one's appetites. 
This stance posed challenges to the concepts of scarcity and consumption regulation. The division of labor emerged as a solution, where individuals focused on their most productive functions to efficiently meet basic human needs like food, clothing, and shelter, thereby maximizing",economics
Agricultural Act of 2014,"The Agricultural Act of 2014 (also known as the 2014 U.S. Farm Bill, formerly the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013) is an act of Congress that authorizes nutrition and agriculture programs in the United States for the years of 2014–2018. The bill authorizes $956 billion in spending over the next ten years.
The bill passed in the United States House of Representatives on January 29, 2014, and the United States Senate on February 4, 2014, during the 113th United States Congress. U.S. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on February 7, 2014. The bill is considered two years late, since farm bills are traditionally passed every five years. The previous farm bill, Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, expired in 2012.

Background
Farm bills
In the United States, the farm bill is the primary agricultural and food policy tool of the federal government.  The comprehensive omnibus bill is passed every five years or so by the United States Congress and deals with both agriculture and all other affairs under the purview of the United States Department of Agriculture. It usually makes amendments and suspensions to provisions of permanent law, reauthorizes, amends, or repeals provisions of preceding temporary agricultural acts, and puts forth new policy provisions for a limited time into the future.  Beginning in 1973, farm bills have included titles on commodity programs, trade, rural development, farm credit, conservation, agricultural research, food and nutrition programs, marketing, etc. Farm bills can be highly controversial and can impact international trade, environmental conservation, food safety, and the well-being of rural communities. The agricultural subsidy programs mandated by the farm bills are the subject of intense debate both within the U.S. and internationally.
The farm bill was first created during the Great Depression to give financial assistance to farmers who were struggling due to an excess crop supply creating low prices, and also to control and ensure an adequate food supply. The first farm bill, known as the Agriculture Adjustment Act (AAA), was passed by Congress in 1933 as a part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 is the most recent farm bill, prior to this one.

Provisions of the bill
The bill includes cuts to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as ""food stamps"". According to The New York Times, the $8 billion in cuts will mean that 850,000 households will lose $90/month in benefits. However, the bill increases funding to food banks by $200 million. SNAP is the largest portion of spending in the bill. The $8 billion in cuts comes from setting a minimum of $20 per year for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to receive the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) deduction, disallow medical marijuana as a deduction and ruling that lottery winners and persons convicted of certain crimes (murder, aggrav",economics
Defendo,"Defendo is a Canadian military martial art and a self defence system created during WWII for law enforcement structures by veteran instructors. Creator Bill Underwood had created Combato in 1910, at 15 years old. a ""non-boxing or wrestling"" unarmed combat system which he taught in Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto, Ontario. Underwood was the first to bring it out of the military and start teaching it as Defendo to the general public which grew in popularity because of his efforts.

History
Combato had its beginning in the Liverpool theatres with jujutsu demonstrations by travelling Japanese wrestlers, Yukio Tani and Taro Miyake. As a boy, Underwood idolized these experts, and rapidly established a comprehensive knowledge of their training
The public name Defendo was created on August 15, 1945, in New York City by Underwood's daughter, Pat. Pat worked in military procurement at Canadian Forces Base Trenton during the war until 1950, certainly the name Defendo had become common knowledge within the Canadian Forces. Underwood was a guest in the United States training U.S. Army Rangers and for the American FBI for use in unarmed combat. Underwood was frequently requested by American and Canadian Law Enforcement Agencies to teach his Combato system during World War II, but as the war had ended he refused on the basis that Combato was too aggressive. Underwood was asked to modify the system to remove its lethal applications and instead focus on the Law Enforcement applications of self-defence, compliance and control tactics. He realized that he could not call this system Combato, so his daughter Pat Underwood proposed that he call the system ""Defendo"".

A new name
From 1945 to 1950 Underwood taught his developing self-defence system in Canada and the USA under the new name. In 1950 he published under copyright ""Defendo, Police System of Self-Defence"",  From 1950 to 1969, Underwood travelled throughout Canada, the United States and in the UK (1965), teaching his system. In 1969, under copyright Underwood published ""Defendo, Occidental System of Self-Protection"".

Media
From 1969 to his death on February 8, 1986, in Newmarket, Ontario, Underwood was well known for his system and honoured and profiled frequently by the North American media. In 1980 a short documentary film about Underwood's life and work, entitled Don't Mess With Bill was nominated for an Oscar at the 53rd Academy Awards in 1981. The film was produced by Pen Densham and John Watson.
Between 1980 and 1981 Underwood appeared four times on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. He also appeared at that time on all of Hollywood's major talk shows including Real People, That's Incredible, and Merv Griffin; on all occasions, promoting and teaching his system of Defendo.

History of Camagüey,"Camagüey (Spanish pronunciation: [kamaˈ(ɣ)wej]) is a city and municipality in central Cuba and is the nation's third-largest city with more than 333,000 inhabitants. It is the capital of the Camagüey Province.
It was founded as Santa María del Puerto del Príncipe in 1514, by Spanish colonists on the northern coast and moved inland in 1528, to the site of a Taino village named Camagüey. It was one of the seven original settlements (villas) founded in Cuba by the Spanish. After Henry Morgan burned the city in the 17th century, it was redesigned like a maze so attackers would find it hard to move around inside the city.
The symbol of the city of Camagüey is the clay pot or tinajón, used to capture rain water and keep it fresh. Camagüey is also the birthplace of Ignacio Agramonte (1841), an important figure of the Ten Years' War against Spain. A monument by Italian sculptor Salvatore Buemi, erected in the center of the area to Ignacio Agramonte, was unveiled by his wife in 1912. It is composed of an equestrian statue, reliefs in bronze that reveal fragments of the life of Agramonte, and a sculpture of a woman that symbolizes the motherland.
In July 2008, the old town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, because of its irregular, maze-like city planning, its prominent role in early Spanish colonization and agriculture, and its rich architecture showing a variety of influences.

History
Camagüey was founded as Santa María del Puerto del Príncipe in 2 February 1514, by Spanish colonists led by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar at a location now known as Nuevitas on the northern coast. It was one of the seven original settlements (villas) founded in Cuba by the Spanish. The settlement was moved inland in 1528 to the site of a Taíno village named Camagüey.
The new city was built with a confusing lay-out of winding alleys. There are many blind alleys and forked streets that lead to squares of different sizes. One explanation is that this was done by design, to make the city easier to defend from any raiders; by the same version, the reason that there is only one exit from the city was that should pirates ever return and succeed in entering the city, it would be possible for local inhabitants to entrap and kill them. However, locals dispute this reasoning as a myth, asserting that in truth the city developed without planning, and that winding streets developed out of everybody wanting to stay close to their local church (the city has 15 of them).
During the eighteenth century the city was called Santa María del Puerto del Príncipe; between 1747 and 1753 Luis de Unzaga y Amézaga, then captain governor of Puerto del Príncipe, rehabilitated the city, which had been badly damaged during the War of Jenkins' Ear, and Unzaga also rebuilt the Church of La Merced.

Upon Cuba's independence from Spain, in 1898, was when the city and its surrounding province received the current name of Camagüey, as a result of the independence from Spain. The indigenous name was alr",history
Natural science,"Natural science or empirical science is one of the branches of science concerned with the description, understanding and prediction of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. Mechanisms such as peer review and reproducibility of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.
Natural science can be divided into two main branches: life science and physical science. Life science is alternatively known as biology. Physical science is subdivided into branches: physics, astronomy, Earth science and chemistry. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields). As empirical sciences, natural sciences use tools from the formal sciences, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements that can be explained as clear statements of the ""laws of nature"".
Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to natural philosophy. Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science. Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on. Today, ""natural history"" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.

Criteria
Philosophers of science have suggested several criteria, including Karl Popper's controversial falsifiability criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. Validity, accuracy, and quality control, such as peer review and reproducibility of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in today's global scientific community.
In natural science, impossibility assertions come to be widely accepted as overwhelmingly probable rather than considered proven to the point of being unchallengeable. The basis for this strong acceptance is a combination of extensive evidence of something not occurring, combined with an underlying theory, very successful in making predictions, whose assumptions lead logically to the conclusion that something is impossible. While an impossibility assertion in natural science can never be proved, it could be refuted by the observation of a single counterexample. Such a counterexample would require that the assumptions underlying the theory that implied the impossibility be re-examined.

Extremism of the centre,"Extremism of the centre is a term in sociology introduced by Seymour Martin Lipset. In his book Political Man (1960) he wrote that left-wing extremism has its basis in the lower classes and the working class, while right-wing extremism is anchored in the upper classes, and fascism originates in the socioeconomic middle class. He did not define the term fascism further. This analysis was extended by the sociologist Theodor Geigers, who explained the election success of the Nazi Party in the early 1930s as a reaction from the Mittelstand (the section of the economy composed of small and medium-sized businesses), and related his analysis to the contemporary analysis of extremist and anti-democratic movements of the middle of society. This added a new type to the extremism of the left and right, and explained fascism as a typically middle-class movement.
Jürgen R. Winkler ranks Lipset's theory – together with the work of Richard Hofstadter (The Pseudo-Conservative Revolt) – as an important theory in the research of right-wing extremism. Similar to the theories of relative deprivation, Lipset's theory concerns the belonging of individuals to collectives, their perceptions of their economic and social situation, and their mental state. According to Winkler, Lipset's theory, in which people who see their status as at risk are prone to supporting right-wight extremist movements, is very influential within this research.
The socioeconomic analysis Hitlers Wähler (1991) by Jürgen W. Falter puts the middle class thesis of the rise of Nazism into perspective. Falter found out that while indeed 40% of Nazi voters came from the middle class, the working class also represented a significant voter group. The most significant social characteristic of a Nazi Party voter was religious denomination, with Protestants voting for the Nazis much more than Catholics.
In the 1990s, the term became a political buzzword in Germany, which was used alongside a criticism of society in general. With their positioning in the discussions about Leitkultur, multiculturalism, nation and immigration, the political and economic elites (and not the far-right parties themselves) are said to promote far-right ideas, and this prepares the way to an authoritarian society.

Antithesis (Netherlands),"The Antithesis (Dutch: Antithese) is a conflict between Christian democratic, confessional parties, united in the Coalition and Liberal parties, united in the Concentration between 1888 and 1918. The conflict concerned the equalisation of payment for religious schools. The realisation of this necessitated a constitutional revision, which needed the support of two-thirds of both houses of parliament. Both political parties held about fifty per cent of the MPs, however. The issue was forced by Anti-Revolutionary Party leader Abraham Kuyper, who hoped that an alliance of Catholics and Protestants would gain the necessary number of seats, but this strategy failed. The issue was finally resolved in the Pacification of 1917.

John Hancock (venereologist),"John Arthur Harland Hancock (1923 – 7 June 1974) was a British venereologist and editor of the British Journal of Venereal Diseases who wrote on non-gonococcal urethritis and reactive arthritis, what was known as Reiter's disease at the time. In 1945, while studying medicine at the London Hospital, he was one of the voluntary students sent to Belsen to assist nutritionist Arnold Peter Meiklejohn in feeding the starving inmates. There, he became unwell with typhus and was treated back at The London by Lord Evans. 
Following his recovery, he completed his medical studies and gained his medical degree in 1948. Subsequently, he began a career in dermatology, first as a house officer to the dermatology department and then with his National Service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, becoming officer-in-charge of the dermatology department at the Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot and later in a post of Acting Adviser in dermatology to the War Office. Later, he pursued a career in venereology.

Early life
John Hancock was born in 1923. In 1945, while studying medicine at the London Hospital, he was one of the voluntary students sent to Belsen to assist nutritionist Arnold Peter Meiklejohn in feeding the starving inmates. Here, he became unwell with typhus and was treated back at the London Hospital by Lord Evans.

Career
Following this interruption in his medical studies, Hancock gained his medical degree in 1948 and began a career in dermatology, first as a house officer to the dermatology department and then with his National Service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, becoming officer-in-charge of the dermatology department at the Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot and later in a post of Acting Adviser in dermatology to the War Office.
Later, he took up a career in venereal disease. In June 1957, he spent one year as Fellow in Medicine at the Syphilis Clinic and Department of Chronic Diseases at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore. When he returned to the London Hospital as a senior registrar, he was appointed Assistant Physician to the Medical Research Council Working Party on non-gonococcal urethritis. From 1959 to 1962 he was Acting Part-time Consultant to the Metropolitan Hospital. In his paper ""Surface Manifestations of Reiter's Disease in the Male"", British Journal of Venereal Diseases (BJVD) (1960), he noted that 26% of the men he assessed with the disease had ring shaped lesions on their penis.
Between 1968 and 1972 he became editor of the BJVD. In addition to writing on ""Reiter's disease"" (now known as reactive arthritis), he wrote on non-gonococcal urethritis, reporting in 1959, 4.7% incidence of urethral stricture, diagnosed by urethroscopy, in the notes of 276 men with non-gonococcal urethritis.

Death
Hancock died in 1974, at the age of 51.

Comeback (publicity),"A comeback, in terms of publicity, is a return by a well-known person to the activity in which they initially obtained their fame. Comebacks can occur in all walks of life, and have been noted to occur in entertainment, sports, and politics.
A comeback may occur after a public figure has been forced to withdraw from the public eye due to a real or perceived scandal.

Entertainment
An entertainer may make a comeback after having been absent from their area of entertainment for a time.
In South Korea, Comeback (K-pop), talent agencies stage-manage the debut of new acts in order to create anticipation for the new act, which will often officially debut live on one of the main television music programs with a ""debut stage"". For the debut single, acts will have an overall ""concept"", a marketing hook, which influences the name of the act, clothes, choreography, catch phrases and how they are presented; within bands individual members will have a personal concept, this being a role that they will play within the band, e.g. leader, visual, maknae, rapper etc. Once a rookie act's debut cycle has ended they enter their second promotional cycle with a ""comeback"", called as such even when the musician or group in question did not go on hiatus. Each promotional cycle will be presented with its own concept.

Sports
In sports, a comeback occurs where an athlete or a team returns to success after a period of poor performance or inactivity. ""The comeback may be the most compelling phenomenon in sports. ... Comebacks in individual sports like tennis, boxing, or golf occur more commonly than in team sports, as athletes in these games have more control over their destiny"".

Politics
A politician may make a comeback after having left public life, either voluntarily or through loss of an election.

Mains electricity by country,"Mains electricity by country includes a list of countries and territories, with the plugs, voltages and frequencies they commonly use for providing electrical power to low voltage appliances, equipment, and lighting typically found in homes and offices. (For industrial machinery, see industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets.) Some countries have more than one voltage available. For example, in North America, a unique split-phase system is used to supply to most premises that works by center tapping a 240 volt transformer. This system is able to concurrently provide 240 volts and 120 volts. Consequently, this allows homeowners to wire up both 240 V and 120 V circuits as they wish (as regulated by local building codes). Most sockets are connected to 120 V for the use of small appliances and electronic devices, while larger appliances such as dryers, electric ovens, ranges and EV chargers use dedicated 240 V sockets. Different sockets are mandated for different voltage or maximum current levels.
Voltage, frequency, and plug type vary, but large regions may use common standards. Physical compatibility of receptacles may not ensure compatibility of voltage, frequency, or connection to earth (ground), including plugs and cords. In some areas, older standards may still exist. Foreign enclaves, extraterritorial government installations, or buildings frequented by tourists may support plugs not otherwise used in a country, for the convenience of travellers.

Main reference source – IEC World Plugs
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) publishes a web microsite World Plugs which provides the main source for this page, except where other sources are indicated. World Plugs includes some history, a description of plug types, and a list of countries giving the type(s) used and the mains voltage and frequency.
Although useful for quick reference, especially for travellers, IEC World Plugs may not be regarded as totally accurate, as illustrated by the examples in the plugs section below, and errors may exist.

Youth intervention,"Youth intervention is a practice within the field of youth services. This practice is designed to intervene when young people are at risk of or beginning to make poor decisions that can have lifelong negative impacts. Youth intervention is intended to support academic achievement and prevent juvenile delinquency.

Basis
Youth intervention providers work with young people to help them become engaged and contributing members of the community. Typically, youth intervention programs work with young people between 6 and 18 years of age, but may also work with young people between 18 and 24 years of age.
Poor decision-making or engaging in negative behaviors that can lead to interaction with the juvenile justice system can often be a symptom of an underlying problem. Causation factors can include unaddressed mental and emotional health struggles, unhealthy family environments and relationships, as well as stress and adverse childhood experiences (ACES) related to poverty.
With the wide variety of challenges that can lead to poor decision-making, youth intervention encompasses a broad array of program approaches. Youth intervention can include:

Pre-court diversion
Restorative justice
mental and chemical health counseling
Mentoring
Out-of-school time programs
Transitional housing for young people who are homeless
Employability
The theory of positive youth development underpins most youth intervention programs. Adults working in Youth Intervention programs are part of that needed web of support.

Outcomes
With a focus on prevention, measuring the impact of youth intervention is challenging. It is difficult to document that behavior did not occur as a result of youth intervention programs. However, research has shown these programs are effective in reducing truancy and improving school performance. They also result in reduced court costs, a reduced need for social services by the youth and/or family and improved health outcomes.  Youth intervention produces positive outcomes at a much lower price than incarceration in a juvenile correction facility. Studies show that 70% to 80% of youth who are incarcerated are likely to re-offend. 
Both the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine agree that the benefits of youth intervention programs outweigh the costs of prevention and early intervention programs. The estimated cost per youth for Youth Intervention is $1,000 to $5,000 per year depending on the type of service. The study also estimated that quality Youth Intervention programs result in $4.80 of benefits per dollar spent on the program.

Structures for youth intervention
In the United States, youth intervention activities are provided on the local, regional, state and federal levels by public agencies and private organizations. They are fiscally supported through government funding, philanthropic grants, and private grants. 
At the level of the U.S. federal government, ""The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) spon",science
Representational harm,"Systems cause representational harm when they misrepresent a group of people in a negative manner. Representational harms include perpetuating harmful stereotypes about or minimizing the existence of a social group, such as a racial, ethnic, gender, or religious group. Machine learning algorithms often commit representational harm when they learn patterns from data that have algorithmic bias, and this has been shown to be the case with large language models. While preventing representational harm in models is essential to prevent harmful biases, researchers often lack precise definitions of representational harm and conflate it with allocative harm, an unequal distribution of resources among social groups, which is more widely studied and easier to measure. However, recognition of representational harms is growing and preventing them has become an active research area. Researchers have recently developed methods to effectively quantify representational harm in algorithms, making progress on preventing this harm in the future.

Types
Three prominent types of representational harm include stereotyping, denigration, and misrecognition. These subcategories present many dangers to individuals and groups.
Stereotypes are oversimplified and usually undesirable representations of a specific group of people, usually by race and gender. This often leads to the denial of educational, employment, housing, and other opportunities. For example, the model minority stereotype of Asian Americans as highly intelligent and good at mathematics can be damaging professionally and academically.
Denigration is the action of unfairly criticizing individuals. This frequently happens when the demeaning of social groups occurs. For example, when searching for ""Black-sounding"" names versus ""white-sounding"" ones, some retrieval systems bolster the false perception of criminality by displaying ads for bail-bonding businesses. A system may shift the representation of a group to be of lower social status, often resulting in a disregard from society.
Misrecognition, or incorrect recognition, can display in many forms, including, but not limited to, erasing and alienating social groups, and denying people the right to self-identify. Erasing and alienating social groups involves the unequal visibility of certain social groups; specifically, systematic ineligibility in algorithmic systems perpetuates inequality by contributing to the underrepresentation of social groups. Not allowing people to self-identify is closely related as people's identities can be 'erased' or 'alienated' in these algorithms. Misrecognition causes more than surface-level harm to individuals: psychological harm, social isolation, and emotional insecurity can emerge from this subcategory of representational harm.

Quantification
As the dangers of representational harm have become better understood, some researchers have developed methods to measure representational harm in algorithms.

Snakebot,"A snakebot, also referred to as a snake robot, is a biomorphic robot that resembles a snake. Snakebots have uses similar to those of certain types of soft robots.
Snakebots can vary significantly in size and design. Their small cross-section-to-length ratios allow them to maneuver through tight spaces. Their ability to change shape allows them to traverse varied terrain.
Snake robots are often designed by connecting multiple independent segments, which provides redundancy and enables continued operation even if some parts are damaged. Snakebots have been posited for a range of practical applications.
A snakebot differs from a snake-arm robot in that, snakebots are usually self-contained, whereas snake-arm robots typically have mechanics remote from the arm itself, possibly connected to a larger system.

Applications
By mimicking the locomotion of snakes, snakebots can be used for tasks in multiple industries that traditional robots or human workers may find challenging or impossible to accomplish safely. Snakebots have been considered for the following applications:

Search and rescue: A snakebot was deployed for search and rescue after the September 2017 earthquake in Mexico City.
Inspection and maintenance: These robots can also be used for inspecting hard-to-reach areas, such as tubes, pipelines, bridges, and other infrastructure elements.
Medical applications: In medical technology, miniature versions of Snakebots have been developed for endoscopic and minimally invasive procedures. An example is the medical snakebot developed at Carnegie Mellon University, which is capable of maneuvering around organs inside a human chest cavity.
Military and surveillance: Due to their quiet, agile movement, snakebots are being considered for reconnaissance and surveillance tasks in military and defense settings.
Space exploration: Space agencies are exploring the use of snakebots to navigate extraterrestrial terrains, such as the rocky, uneven surfaces of Mars or the Moon, including steep craters. Unlike traditional rovers, which can get stuck on uneven ground, snakebots can adapt to challenging terrains, slithering over rocks or squeezing into crevices to gather data in places otherwise inaccessible. An example is the Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor designed to explore the surface and the oceans of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn.

Locomotion
Traditional Snakebots move by changing the shape of their body, similar to actual snakes. Many variants have been created that use wheels or treads for movement. There has yet to be any Snakebots that accurately approximate the locomotion of real snakes. However, researchers have produced new movement methods that do not occur in nature. 
In snakebot research, a gait is a periodic mode of locomotion/movement. Sidewinding and lateral undulation are both examples of gaits. Snakebot gaits are often designed by investigating period changes to the shape of the robot. For example, a caterpillar moves by changing the shape of it",technology

Sphairee,"Sphairee is a miniature form of tennis developed in Australia.
Sphairee derives its name from the Greek word for ball sphaira.

History
It was developed by Frederick Arthur George Beck in Sydney in 1961. The New South Wales Sphairee Association was formed in 1961. The first New South Wales Championships were held in 1963 with R.B. Frost and N.Brown winning the men's and women's titles respectively. In 1998, it was reported that the game had ebbed and it was played in 15 primary and high schools in Tasmania and on the first Tuesday of each month at the Greenwich Community Centre on Sydney's lower north shore. The game has been played in Mauritius, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The game has also been played since at least the 1970s at Camp Ponacka, a boys camp just south of Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada, and includes four single-knockout elimination tournaments for the Munnfellow Cup every summer.

Description
Rules of the game include: 

Field of play can be indoor or outdoor
Court is 6.2 m by 2.2 m with the net being 0.6 m high.
Bats are similar to oversized table tennis bats
A perforated plastic ball 7 cm in diameter is used

Data Colada,"Data Colada is a blog dedicated to investigative analysis and replication of academic research, focusing in particular on the validity of findings in the social sciences.
It is known for its advocacy against problematic research practices such as p-hacking, and for publishing evidence of data manipulation and research misconduct in several prominent cases, including celebrity professors Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino. Data Colada was established in 2013 by three behavioral science researchers: Uri Simonsohn, a professor at ESADE Business School, Barcelona/Spain (as of 2023), Leif Nelson, a professor at University of California, Berkeley, and Joe Simmons, a professor at University of Pennsylvania.

History
Around 2011, Simmons, Nelson and Simonsohn ""bonded over the false, ridiculous, and flashy findings that the field [of behavioral sciences] was capable of producing"", such as a paper by Cornell psychologist Daryl Bem that had supposedly found evidence for clairvoyance. They reacted by publishing an influential 2011 paper about false positive results in psychology, illustrating the problem with a parody research finding that supposedly showed that listening to the Beatles song ""When I’m Sixty-Four"" made experimental subjects one and a half years younger.
The ""Data Colada"" blog was launched two years later, in 2013, carrying the tagline ""Thinking about evidence, and vice versa"", becoming what the New York Times described as ""a hub for nerdy discussions of statistical methods — and, before long, various research crimes and misdemeanors"".
In particular, the three researchers objected to the then widespread practice of cherry-picking data and attempts to make insignificant results appear statistically credible, especially an approach for which they coined the term p-hacking in a 2014 paper.

Notable findings
Apart from calling out faulty, but presumably well-intended research practices, Data Colada also published evidence of data manipulations and research misconduct.  These include studies about the concept of the moral high ground by psychologist Lawrence Sanna, and research by Flemish psychologist Dirk Smeesters. According to The New Yorker, after Data Colada published their work, the careers of Sanna and Smeesters ""came to an unceremonious end"".
In 2021, Data Colada discovered fabricated data in a 2012 field study published in PNAS by Lisa L. Shu, Nina Mazar, Francesca Gino, Dan Ariely, and Max H. Bazerman. All of the study's authors agreed with their assessment and the paper was retracted. The authors also agreed that Ariely was the only author who had access to the data prior to transmitting it in its fraudulent form to Mazar, the analyst. Ariely denied manipulating the data, but Excel metadata showed that he created the spreadsheet and was the last to edit it. He also admitted to having mislabeled all of the values in an entire column of the data in an e-mail to Mazar shortly after he initially sent her the data. Ariely has stated that someone a",science

The term has various applications and meanings, and specific definitions can vary widely between denominations, geographical locations, historical contexts, and different schools of thought.  Christian values also relate to the Christian identity in identity politics.

Modern Christian Values
Modern Christian values are based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, as found in the Bible, and include values such as love, compassion, integrity, and justice. They guide how Christians live their lives and interact with others.
Some core values include:

Love as the central ethical command
Compassion: A core value of Christianity

Broadly Applicable Tracking System,"The Broadly Applicable Tracking System, or BATS, is a small, lightweight tool that scientists use to track animal movements. It is shaped like a backpack and glued onto the back of a bat or other small animal. It contains GPS and wireless internet equipment that allow the scientists track the animal's movements.
The scientists who invented BATS differentiate it from other systems because it is lighter, requires less power, and can track animals even inside caves or hollow trees. BATS can be made on a 3D printer, and it is so light that it does not slow down small bats when they fly.
BATS falls off the animal's back after about fourteen days.  Scientists then collect fallen BATS to reuse the parts.
Scientists have used BATS to show that vampire bats form social bonds when being kept by humans that they remember after being released.

Name
Scientists named the tool ""broadly applicable tracking system"" because they believe it can be used in a broad range of animals: bats, rodents, amphibians and reptiles. As of April 2020, BATS has only been used on bats.

Invention
The team that invented BATS includes scientists from the Museum of Natural History in Berlin and universities in Germany and Ohio State University.

Democratization,"Democratization, or democratisation, is the structural government transition from an authoritarian government to a more democratic political regime, including substantive political changes moving in a democratic direction.
Whether and to what extent democratization occurs can be influenced by various factors, including economic development, historical legacies, civil society, and international processes. Some accounts of democratization emphasize how elites drove democratization, whereas other accounts emphasize grassroots bottom-up processes. How democratization occurs has also been used to explain other political phenomena, such as whether a country goes to a war or whether its economy grows.
The opposite process is known as democratic backsliding or autocratization.

Description
Theories of democratization seek to explain a large macro-level change of a political regime from authoritarianism to democracy. Symptoms of democratization include reform of the electoral system, increased suffrage and reduced political apathy.

Measures of democratization
Democracy indices enable the quantitative assessment of democratization. Some common democracy indices are Freedom House, Polity data series, V-Dem Democracy indices and Democracy Index. Democracy indices can be quantitative or categorical. Some disagreements among scholars concern the concept of democracy and how to measure democracy – and what democracy indices should be used.

Waves of democratization
One way to summarize the outcome theories of democratization seek to account is with the idea of waves of democratization

A wave of democratization refers to a major surge of democracy in history. And Samuel P. Huntington identified three waves of democratization that have taken place in history. The first one brought democracy to Western Europe and Northern America in the 19th century. It was followed by a rise of dictatorships during the Interwar period. The second wave began after World War II, but lost steam between 1962 and the mid-1970s. The latest wave began in 1974 and is still ongoing. Democratization of Latin America and the former Eastern Bloc is part of this third wave.
Waves of democratization can be followed by waves of de-democratization. Thus, Huntington, in 1991, offered the following depiction.
• First wave of democratization, 1828–1926
• First wave of de-democratization, 1922–42
• Second wave of democratization, 1943–62
• Second wave of de-democratization, 1958–75
• Third wave of democratization, 1974–
The idea of waves of democratization has also been used and scrutinized by many other authors, including Renske Doorenspleet, John Markoff, Seva Gunitsky, and Svend-Erik Skaaning.
According to Seva Gunitsky, from the 18th century to the Arab Spring (2011–2012), 13 democratic waves can be identified.
The V-Dem Democracy Report identified for the year 2023 9 cases of stand-alone democratization in East Timor, The Gambia, Honduras, Fiji, Dominican Republic, Solomon Islands, Montenegro",politics
Code word (figure of speech),"A code word is a word or a phrase designed to convey a predetermined meaning to an audience who know the phrase, while remaining inconspicuous to the uninitiated. For example, a public address system may be used to make an announcement asking for ""Inspector Sands"" to attend a particular area, which staff will recognise as a code word for a fire or bomb threat, and the general public will ignore.

Medical use
A doctor may refer to a suspected case of tuberculosis as ""Koch's disease"" in order to avoid alarming patients.
Some medical nicknames are derogatory, such as GOMER for ""Get Out of My Emergency Room"".
Emergency rescue workers or police officers may say, ""There is a 'K',"" to mean a dead body. Valtteri Suomalainen reported eksi (from Latin: exitus lethalis), in use in hospitals in Finland.
Code Pink in some hospitals can mean a missing baby, and the initiation of an all-staff response.
The euphemisms ""Rose Cottage"" and ""Rainbow's End"" are sometimes used in British hospitals to enable discussion of death in front of patients, the latter mainly for children. A similar phrase used is: ""transferred to ward 13"", as hospitals in the UK routinely do not have such a ward.
American hospitals may make an announcement regarding a ""Mr. [or Dr.] Strong"", as code to alert orderlies that a patient or visitor at a stated location is in need of physical restraint.

Military and espionage use
Code names are used for military and espionage purposes as labels for people, locations, objects, projects and plans the details of which are intended to remain secret to the uninitiated.
For example, the code name of ""Mogul"" is used by the United States Secret Service to refer to the former President of the United States Donald Trump. 
The United States Navy mistook the code word ""Friend of Dorothy,"" meaning an LGBT individual, as meaning literally a person who was a friend of someone by the name of ""Dorothy,"" and investigated on that basis.

Other usages
In the United Kingdom, Inspector Sands is a code word to alert staff of an emergency situation such as a fire or an attack, without causing a mass panic. This code word was used in the Manchester Arena bombing and is used in the majority of British transport locations. The code word is usually used in the context: ""Would Inspector Sands please report to the operations room immediately.""
Some stores have special codes that allow one employee to inform another that a certain customer in the store needs to be watched because they are acting in a suspicious manner similar to the typical behavior of a shoplifter.
Movie theater employees may say, ""Mr. Johnson is in theater number three"" to indicate that there is a fire or smoke in that theater. Nightclubs and bars often use the name ""Mr. Sands"".
Many taxi drivers use radio codes like, ""There's an oil spill at ..."", or ""Cardboard boxes lying on the road ..."", to warn other drivers of a police speed detection unit.  There are other codes to tell other drivers that a popular taxi ",politics
Cockroach racing,"Cockroach racing is a club gambling activity which started in 1982 at the Story Bridge Hotel in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The event is held on The Last Weekend In January, ""Brisbanes Most Iconic Races"". This type of racing has spread to many parts of the world including the United States. In North America, cockroach racing has recently become a popular feature for money, prizes, or just for its entertainment value. It is held in exhibitions promoting entomology where the public and entomologists participate.
In the first-ever event held in 1982, the winning cockroach was called 'Soft Cocky'. Cockroaches are brought to the races by the participants but the roach could also be bought at the venue of the races. The preferred option is, however, to bring one's own cockroaches, from the stable. The proceeds from the event are given away to charity.

Racing
The background to the starting of this race in Australia in 1982 is attributed to two bar buffs who boasted that the cockroaches of their area were the fastest in Brisbane. They tested the validity of their claims in a parking lot.
The racing event in Australia generates a feverish pitch and the event held annually is given the hyperbole as ""the greatest gathering of thoroughbred cockroaches in the world"". Every year, seven such events are held in Australia, which is known as the sprint, the steeplechase and main event held at the Story Bridge Hotel called the Gold Cup event. The race arena is 6 metres (20 ft) ring. The roaches kept in glass bottles are let out in the middle of the ring. The cockroach which reaches the edge of the ring first is declared a winner. There is an entry fee to participate in the event. The winners listed so far in the Hall of Fame of this Australian event are unusual names such as ""Soft Cocky, Cocky Balboa, Cocky Dundee, Drain Lover, and Priscila-Queen of the Drains"". 
Cockroaches are known for their fast speed of movement, second only to the speed of tiger beetles. They can generate speeds up to 50 body lengths per second which in a sprinter's language is of the order of 322 kilometres per hour (200 mph) or equivalent to completing a 100 metres (330 ft) sprint in less than 1 second.

In the United States
The racing of cockroaches as a club gambling activity started in Australia in 1982. However, at the Loyola University Maryland, the event of cockroach racing is called ""Madagascar Madness: The Running of the Roaches."" The students of General Entomology wing of the university train Madagascar Cockroaches for short sprints and also for marathon racing. The race generates lot of interest and large number of people gather to witness the event.
In the United States, the cockroach race is also a popular event held prior to the presidential election. It is conducted every four years by the Pest Control Association of New Jersey. The race predicts the Democratic candidate for the presidential election; in 1999, Al Gore won over Bill Bradley and Bill Clinton ""won by an ant",sports
Tent boxing,"Tent boxing is an amusement previously seen at agricultural shows throughout Australia.

History
Starting in the late 19th century, boxing troupes of professional fighters would travel the mining towns and outback of the country, following fairs and carnivals, putting up big top tents and taking on all-comers for cash in the ring.
Among the more famous of tent boxing troupes, are the ones created by Roy Bell and Jimmy Sharman.
Fred Brophy is believed to be one of the world's last boxing tent showmen. Brophy continues to travel with his troupe across Queensland each year. For his years of touring with his tent boxing show, Brophy was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2011 for his role in raising money for charity and for services to the entertainment industry.

A dangerous sport
Largely unreported on, little is known about early tent boxers and events due to participants and spectators being largely illiterate. In more modern times, very few photographs exist of the movement as organisers disapprove of media involvement.
Fred Brophy insists he will continue travelling with his tent boxing troupe, until he dies, even though the sport was banned in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia in 1971 by the government, due to health concerns.

Microfadeometry,"Microfadeometry is a technique that uses tiny spots of intense light to probe and measure color changes in objects of art that are particularly sensitive to light exposure.
This process is completed using a recently designed instrument known as a microfading tester. The data from the test is represented by reflectance spectra.

History
Light-fastness testing dates back to as early as 1733. In the late 19th century with early art conservation studies, Russell and Abney published Action of Light on Watercolors in 1888 sparking a concern with light and the aging of cultural materials. Microfading, as a technique, was first identified in Paul Whitmore’s lab book entry on September 21, 1994. His work on the topic was later published in 1999.

Application
Before the creation of this technique, recording light-stability information directly from the objects was nearly impossible. Through the use of microfading technology, it is now possible to obtain both information about the chemical characterization of the dyes and the associated kinetics of color change.
Benchtop microfaders and microfading testers are used to test and analyze light damage on cultural objects and potential light damage to objects in museum collections.

Theory
Using a powerful xenon arc lamp, 1 lumen of light is focused through an optical fiber onto a 300–400 μm spot of the object’s surface. The reflected light is collected by a second fiber optic. The period of exposure is monitored with a probe that transforms the reflectance spectrum into color coordinates in real-time. A typical microfading test is achieved in less than 10 minutes and replicates exposures equivalent to 5–12 years of display at normal museum light levels. The output of the xenon arc lamp is kept at constant by an exposure controller while it is filtered to 400–710 nm using a water filter. The spectrum is then used to quantify the amount of time it would take for the color change to result in a noticeable difference. This information is used to retrofit display conditions and improve the protection of vulnerable objects.
Calibration of the instrument is achieved by using internal standards such as the Blue Wool Scale.

Reliability
Concerns associated with microfading techniques include diffusion-limited photo-oxidation reaction rates, dehydration and heating of the sample, the variability of using and measuring ISO Blue Wool Standards, variation in spectral power distribution between lamps used in object display, and the lamp used in accelerated light aging, the small sampling area, the required number of sample the length of fading time and the potential interaction of individual chemical components of the object tested.

Institutional Use
Cultural institutions that house their own instruments for microfadeometry include the Library of Congress and the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Canadian Conservation Institute in Ottawa, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art",science
Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis,"Ignaz Semmelweis discovered in 1847 that hand-wash with a solution of chlorinated lime reduced the incidence of fatal childbed fever tenfold in maternity institutions. However, the reaction of his contemporaries was not positive; his subsequent mental disintegration led to him being confined to an insane asylum, where he died in 1865.
Semmelweis's critics claimed his findings lacked scientific reasoning. The failure of the nineteenth-century scientific community to recognize Semmelweis's findings, and the nature of the flawed critiques outlined below, helped advance a positivist epistemology, leading to the emergence of evidence-based medicine.

Absorption of cadaveric material
Semmelweis's key claim was that physicians contaminated their hands with ""cadaveric particles"" in the morgue while conducting autopsies. He pointed out that ordinary washings with soap did not remove these particles, because the hands could retain a stench for several days in spite of such washings. When physicians later carried out gynaecological examinations, the cadaveric particles were absorbed by the patient, in particular if they came into contact with the freshly exposed uterus, or with genital tract lesions caused by the birth process. Semmelweis was convinced that every case of childbed fever was caused by resorption of cadaveric particles. With this etiology, Semmelweis identified childbed fever as purely an iatrogenic disease—that is, one caused by doctors. (Friedrich Wilhelm Scanzoni von Lichtenfels took personal offense at this, and never forgave Semmelweis for it—Scanzoni remained one of the most ardent critics of Semmelweis.)
A few childbed fever case stories, described below, did not fit well into Semmelweis's theory and led him to expand it, also to comprise other types of decaying organic matter, for instance secretions from an infected knee or from a cancer tumor.
In a case of discharging cancer of the innermost part of the uterus, Semmelweis wrote:

In October 1847, a patient was admitted with discharging medullary carcinoma [cancer of the innermost part] of the uterus. She was assigned the bed at which the rounds were always initiated. After examining this patient, those conducting the examination washed their hands with soap only. The consequence was that of twelve patients then delivering, eleven died. The ichor from the discharging medullary carcinoma was not destroyed by soap and water. … Thus, childbed fever is caused not only by cadaverous particles adhering to hands but also by ichor from living organisms.
And in a case of a discharging carious knee, he wrote:

A new tragic experience persuaded me that air could also carry decaying organic matter. In November of the same year, an individual was admitted with a discharging carious left knee. […] the ichorous exhalations of the carious knee completely saturated the air of her ward. In this way the other patients were exposed and nearly all the patients in that room died. […] The ichorous particles",medicine
Pigford v. Glickman,"Pigford v. Glickman (1999) was a class action lawsuit against the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), alleging that it had racially discriminated against African-American farmers in its allocation of farm loans and assistance from 1981 to 1996. The lawsuit was settled on April 14, 1999, by Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. To date, almost $1 billion US dollars have been paid or credited to fewer than 20,000 farmers under the settlement's consent decree, under what is reportedly the largest civil rights settlement until that point. Due to delaying tactics by U.S. government officials, more than 70,000 farmers were treated as filing late and thus did not have their claims heard. The 2008 Farm Bill provided for additional claims to be heard. In December 2010, Congress appropriated $1.2 billion for what is called ""Pigford II,"" settlement for the second part of the case.

History of African and African American agriculture in the U.S.
Africans and African Americans have a long and rich agricultural history in the U.S. The Atlantic Slave Trade brought over crops such as yams and okra that became popular in American diets, and the farming practices to produce them. Enslaved people taught colonists and natives how to farm various African crops, which was fundamental for the establishment of New World societies. Many enslaved people in the Americas had the freedom and responsibility to control some of their diet by hunting, fishing, and farming. Some slaves were granted individual plots or provision grounds, and many grew food staples in the yards around their dwellings. Some slaves were able to earn cash and gain marginal economic autonomy while maintaining connections to their African culinary heritage.
General William T. Sherman's Special Field Order 15, also referred to as ""40 acres and a mule,"" granted approximately 400,000 acres of farm plots to newly freed Black families but this directive was overturned by President Johnson. Black farm land ownership steadily increased until its peak in 1910, when roughly 14% of all US farm operators were Black.

USDA discrimination against African American farmers
Many white and African American farmers struggled to survive financially in the South throughout the 20th century. The USDA made loans to farmers but they were dependent on applicants' financial credit. Because African Americans were discriminated against, they had difficulty accessing and building credit. They had been disenfranchised by southern laws and policies since the turn of the century and excluded from the political system, a condition that was maintained for much of the 20th century. By the early 20th century, southern states had established one-party political rule by whites under the Democratic Party. In Mississippi, where black farmers made up 2/3 of the total of farmers in the Delta in the late 19th century, most lost their land by 1910 and had to go to sharecropping or tenant farm",economics
Economics of science,"The economics of science aims to understand the impact of science on the advance of technology, to explain the behavior of scientists, and to understand the efficiency or inefficiency of scientific institutions and science markets.
The importance of the economics of science is substantially due to the importance of science as a driver of technology and technology as a driver of productivity and growth.  Believing that science matters, economists have attempted to understand the behavior of scientists and the 
operation of scientific institutions.

Science as a Public Good
Economists consider “science” as the search and production of knowledge using known starting conditions. Knowledge can be considered a public good, due to the fact that its utility to society is not diminished with additional consumption (non-rivalry), and once the knowledge is shared with the public it becomes very hard to restrict access to it or use of it (non-excludable). Traditional public economic theory asserts that competitive markets provide poor incentives for production of a public good because the producers cannot reap the benefits of use of their product, and thus costs will be higher than benefits. Economists have identified several possible reasons as to why producers of science might determine that the private costs they incur in the production process are larger than the benefits that they intend to reap, even though the benefits to society are greater than these costs. Firstly, the technological barriers to production are extremely high, which makes the market very risky. Technological barriers refer to the cost of research and development of new scientific knowledge, which becomes increasingly expensive as technology continues to play a more prominent role in this type of development. Secondly, due to the non-excludable nature of scientific knowledge, producers worry that they will be unable to enforce property rights on their produced goods. This will result in others being able to benefit from the scientific knowledge without having to bear the cost of the research and development, which would in turn make the potential return on investment too small to incentivize participation in the market. Therefore, science can be understood as the production of a public good, and can be studied within the framework of public economics.
However, certain economists argue that a non-market mechanism has developed to correct the problem of indefinable property rights, such that scientists are incentivized to produce knowledge in a socially responsible way. Economist Paula Stephen refers to this mechanism as a reward system based primarily on a concept that she calls “priority of discovery.” Robert Merton argues that the goal of scientists is to establish “priority of discovery” by being the first to report a new discovery, which then results in the reward of recognition. The scientific community only bestows this reward on the person who discovers the new piece of knowledg",economics

Systems science,"Systems science, also referred to as systems research or simply systems, is a transdisciplinary field that is concerned with understanding simple and complex systems in nature and society, which leads to the advancements of formal, natural, social, and applied attributions throughout engineering, technology and science, itself.
To systems scientists, the world can be understood as a system of systems. The field aims to develop transdisciplinary foundations that are applicable in a variety of areas, such as psychology, biology, medicine, communication, business, technology, computer science, engineering, and social sciences.
Themes commonly stressed in system science are (a) holistic view, (b) interaction between a system and its embedding environment, and (c) complex (often subtle) trajectories of dynamic behavior that sometimes are stable (and thus reinforcing), while at various 'boundary conditions' can become wildly unstable (and thus destructive). Concerns about Earth-scale biosphere/geosphere dynamics is an example of the nature of problems to which systems science seeks to contribute meaningful insights.

Associated fields
The systems sciences are a broad array of fields.

Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany,"In the early 20th century, German researchers found additional evidence linking smoking to health harms, which strengthened the anti-tobacco movement in the Weimar Republic and led to a state-supported anti-smoking campaign. Early anti-tobacco movements grew in many nations from the middle of the 19th century. The 1933–1945 anti-tobacco campaigns in Nazi Germany have been widely publicized, although stronger laws than those passed in Germany were passed in some American states, the UK, and elsewhere between 1890 and 1930. After 1941, anti-tobacco campaigns were restricted by the Nazi government.
The German movement was the most powerful anti-smoking movement in the world during the 1930s and early 1940s. However, tobacco control policy was incoherent and ineffective, with uncoordinated and often regional efforts by many actors. Obvious measures were not taken, and existing measures were not enforced. Some Nazi leaders condemned smoking and several of them openly criticized tobacco consumption, but others publicly smoked and denied that it was harmful.
There was much research on smoking and its effects on health during Nazi rule, and it was the most important of its type at that time. A directly supported tobacco research institute produced work of only marginal scientific importance, but substantial academic work was done privately, with little to negative official support.
Adolf Hitler's personal distaste for tobacco and the Nazi reproductive policies were among the motivating factors behind the Nazi campaigns against smoking. The Nazi anti-tobacco campaign included banning smoking in trams, buses, and city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, and raising the tobacco tax. The Nazis also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and smoking in public spaces, and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses. However, these measures were widely circumvented or ignored.
The movement did not reduce the number of smokers. Tobacco use increased rapidly in the early years of the Nazi regime, between 1933 and 1939. The number of smokers increased from 1939 to 1945, but cigarette consumption declined; rationing towards the end of the war and post-war poverty meant that the increasing numbers of smokers could not buy as many cigarettes. Nazi-related nicotine marketing messages have often been used to oppose tobacco control, and criticized for historical inaccuracy. Even by the end of the 20th century, the anti-smoking movement in Germany had not attained the influence of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign. Germany has some of the weakest tobacco control measures in Europe, and German tobacco research has been described as ""muted"".

Underwater football,"Underwater football is a two-team underwater sport that shares common elements with underwater hockey and underwater rugby. As with both of those games, it is played in a swimming pool with snorkeling equipment (mask, snorkel, and fins).
The goal of the game is to manoeuvre (by carrying and passing) a slightly negatively buoyant ball from one side of a pool to the other by players who are completely submerged underwater. Scoring is achieved by placing the ball (under control) in the gutter on the side of the pool. Variations include using a toy rubber torpedo as the ball, and weighing down buckets to rest on the bottom and serve as goals.
It is played in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan.

Origins
Underwater football was developed in the 1960s by Dave Murdoch, a scuba diving instructor who was teaching in the Manitoba's Frank Kennedy Centre. The game developed from a ""keep-away"" training exercise that used a pool brick to develop the students snorkelling skills. It is still played there today.

Rules
Several ball types have been used throughout the game's history. These include a 10-pound pool brick, a junior sized NFL-style football, and a junior sized basketball, all with negative buoyancy. Pneumatic balls (such as the football or basketball) can be made negatively buoyant by filling them with a liquid that is denser (heavier) than water instead of air, e.g. a strong saline solution or corn syrup.
The sport is similar to water polo, but it is played most of the time underwater. Each player can go up to the surface to take air as many times needed, except when he has the football in his hand.
Like the traditional football, one player from each team manoeuvre the ball past their opponents to get to the ball to goal. Each team has 13 players, but only five players are on the court at same time. The player with the ball can swim with it or pass the ball to his team players. Meanwhile, the opponents will try to take the ball from the other player or intercept a pass. And at last the team which has the maximum scores will win.
The court is 10 metres wide (32 ft), 15 metres (49 feet) long, and 4 metres (13 feet) deep.
A match has two 20-minute rounds, and a half-time of 5 minutes.

Governing body
The governing body is the Manitoba Underwater Council, which supports competition by providing insurance required for the hire of swimming pools as well as sponsoring the cost of hire.

Father of the Nation,"The Father of the Nation is an honorific title given to a person considered the driving force behind the establishment of a country, state, or nation. Pater Patriae was a Roman honorific meaning the ""Father of the Fatherland"", bestowed by the Senate on heroes, and later on emperors. In monarchies, the monarch is often considered the ""father/mother of the nation"" or as a patriarch to guide his family. This concept is expressed in the divine right of kings espoused in some monarchies, while in others it is codified into constitutional law.
In the United States, George Washington, commander of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, president of the Constitutional Convention, and the first president of the United States, is commonly considered the Father of the Nation. In Spain, the monarch is considered the personification and embodiment, the symbol of unity and permanence of the nation. In Thailand, the monarch is given the same recognition, and any person who expresses disrespect toward the reigning monarch faces severe criminal penalties.
Many dictators bestow titles upon themselves, which rarely survive the end of their regime. Gnassingbé Eyadéma of Togo's titles included ""father of the nation"", ""older brother"", and ""Guide of the People"". Mobutu Sese Seko, president of Zaire from 1971 to 1997, was referred to as ""Father of the nation"", ""the Guide"", ""the Messiah"", ""the Leopard"", ""the Sun-President"", and ""the Cock who Jumps on Anything That Moves"". In postcolonial Africa, ""father of the nation"" was a title used by many leaders both to refer to their role in the independence movement as a source of legitimacy, and to use paternalist symbolism as a source of continued popularity. On Joseph Stalin's seventieth birthday in 1949, he was bestowed with the title ""Father of Nations"" for his establishment of ""people's democracies"" in countries occupied by the USSR after World War II.
The title ""Father of the Nation"" is sometimes politically contested. The 1972 Constitution of Bangladesh declared Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to be ""father of the nation"". A motion in the Parliament of Slovakia to proclaim controversial pre-war leader Andrej Hlinka ""father of the nation"" barely failed in September 2007.

The following people are still often called the ""Father"" or ""Mother"" of their respective nations.

Dark Ages (historiography),"The Dark Ages is a term for the Early Middle Ages (c. 5th–10th centuries), or occasionally the entire Middle Ages (c. 5th–15th centuries), in Western Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which characterises it as marked by economic, intellectual, and cultural decline.
The concept of a ""Dark Age"" as a historiographical periodization originated in the 1330s with the Italian scholar Petrarch, who regarded the post-Roman centuries as ""dark"" compared to the ""light"" of classical antiquity. The term employs traditional light-versus-darkness imagery to contrast the era's supposed darkness (ignorance and error) with earlier and later periods of light (knowledge and understanding). The phrase Dark Age(s) itself derives from the Latin saeculum obscurum, originally applied by Caesar Baronius in 1602 when he referred to a tumultuous period in the 10th and 11th centuries. The concept thus came to characterize the entire Middle Ages as a time of intellectual darkness in Europe between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance, and became especially popular during the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment. Others, however, have used the term to denote the relative scarcity of written records regarding at least the early part of the Middle Ages.
As the accomplishments of the era came to be better understood in the 19th and the 20th centuries, scholars began restricting the Dark Ages appellation to the Early Middle Ages; today's scholars maintain this posture. The majority of modern scholars avoid the term altogether because of its negative connotations, finding it misleading and inaccurate. Despite this, Petrarch's pejorative meaning remains in use, particularly in popular culture, which often oversimplifies the Middle Ages as a time of violence and backwardness.

History
Petrarch
The idea of a Dark Age originated with the Tuscan scholar Petrarch in the 1330s. Writing of the past, he said: ""Amidst the errors there shone forth men of genius; no less keen were their eyes, although they were surrounded by darkness and dense gloom"". Christian writers, including Petrarch himself, had long used traditional metaphors of 'light versus darkness' to describe 'good versus evil'. Petrarch was the first to give the metaphor secular meaning by reversing its application. He now saw classical antiquity, so long considered a 'dark' age for its lack of Christianity, in the 'light' of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch's own time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.
From his perspective on the Italian peninsula, Petrarch saw the Roman period and classical antiquity as an expression of greatness. He spent much of his time traveling through Europe, rediscovering and republishing classic Latin and Greek texts. He wanted to restore the Latin language to its former purity.

The work promoted sustainable economy in close-knit communities. These include regions that generate their own food, their own energy, their own culture, and their own entertainment. McKibben defined a ""deep economy"" as one that ""cares less about quantity than about quality; that takes as its goal the production of human satisfaction as much as surplus material; that is focused on the idea that it might endure and considers durability at least as important as increases in size."" The book has been generally well-received, though some critics have questioned his proposed solutions.

Overview
The long-standing presumption that ""more"" equals ""better"" in economic growth is questioned by McKibben, who asks if in fact this idea is valid. McKibben also suggests that unfettered growth is not a realistic, sustainable goal. According to McKibben, the invention of the steam engine and the Industrial Revolution in 1712 resulted in a mindset which rapidly altered expectations of economic growth. He also said that, ""The current political assumption ignores both the problems of resource depletion and inequity, which leads to human unhappiness."" In its place, McKibben suggested that the focus should be on ""deep economy"", which includes, rather than constant growth, a consideration of human satisfaction.
As an example of the problem with the current philosophy, McKibben focuses extensively on global, industrial agriculture, which he argues has endangered localized farming communities, damaged the environment, increased the risk of terrorist sabotage of a central food supply, increased food-borne illnesses, led to more mistreatment of farmworkers, and accelerated the depletion of water and oil. The solution to these problems, he suggests, is community-centered farming as currently practiced in Cuba, with similar projects in New England and Detroit. He also examines the West's attitude towards economic inequity. The mega-rich are praised and admired, a symptom of the ""hyper-individualization"" that McKibben regards as a social failure, ecologically, politically and morally. Human beings are psychologically healthier, not to mention happier, when part of a community. Accordingly, community-based economies, wherein goods are locally produced and consumed, foster neighborliness and happiness.
To the end of fostering close communities, McKibben offers several suggestions, ranging from encouraging the use of public transportation to offering a close living environment where multiple residents share living spaces in interconnected condominiums; from developing sustainable alternative energy sources to developing and utilizing a local currency (such as BerkShares) in addition to a national one.

"Humanities, arts, and social sciences","Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) (or Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, AHSS), also known as social studies, is a broad term that groups together the academic disciplines of humanities, arts and social sciences. It is viewed as an academic counterpart to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in the United States, Canada, India, Australia, and other countries. HASS graduates comprise the majority of the workforce in many developed countries (e.g. 64% in Australia). However, HASS Courses often receive lower governmental funding and may have lower reputations within universities. There is a measured relationship between citizens' HASS awareness with more accurate threat perceptions, high community activity, and cultural engagement at the local level. In recent years, a return to a holistic reintegration of HASS and STEM disciplines has been promoted in the U.S. by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 
In the Philippines, a similar term called humanities and social sciences is used to describe a senior high strand that involves the liberal arts. This strand was set up in place as part of the K-12 program that was implemented in the country.

History
In 2020, an initiative in the UK rebranded the HASS acronym for humanities, the arts and social sciences as SHAPE (Social Sciences, Humanities and the Arts for People and the Economy), to promote and highlight the importance of these subjects in education, society, and the economy.

Heraldic visitation,"Heraldic visitations were tours of inspection undertaken by Kings of Arms (or alternatively by heralds, or junior officers of arms, acting as the kings' deputies) throughout England, Wales and Ireland. Their purpose was to register and regulate the coats of arms of nobility, gentry and boroughs, and to record pedigrees. They took place from 1530 to 1688, and their records (akin to an upper class census) provide important source material for historians and genealogists.

Visitations in England
Process of visitations
By the fifteenth century, the use and abuse of coats of arms was becoming widespread in England. One of the duties conferred on William Bruges, the first Garter Principal King of Arms, was to survey and record the armorial bearings and pedigrees of those using coats of arms and correct irregularities. Officers of arms had made occasional tours of various parts of the kingdom to enquire about armorial matters during the fifteenth century.  However, it was not until the sixteenth century that the process began in earnest.
The first provincial visitations were carried out under warrant granted by Henry VIII to Thomas Benolt, Clarenceux King of Arms, dated 6 April 1530. He was commissioned to travel throughout his province (i.e. south of the Trent) with authority to enter all homes and churches. Upon entering these premises, he was authorized to ""put down or otherwise deface at his discretion ... those arms unlawfully used"". He was also required to enquire into all those using the titles of knight, esquire, or gentleman and decided if they were being lawfully used.
By this writ, Henry VIII also compelled the sheriffs and mayors of each county or city visited by the officers of arms to give aid and assistance in gathering the needed information. When a King of Arms, or Herald, visited a county, his presence was proclaimed by presenting the King's royal commission to the local gentry and nobility, which required them to provide evidence of their right to use a coat of arms. The Sheriff would collect from the bailiff of each hundred within his county a list of all people using titles or arms.
In the early days, the visiting herald would tour the homes of the gentry and nobility, but from the late 1560s these persons were summoned to attend a central ""place of sitting"" – usually an inn – at a particular time. They were to bring their arms, and proof of their right to use them, most often by way of detailing their ancestral right to them, which would also be recorded. Where an official grant of arms had been made, this was also recorded. Other ancient arms, many of which predated the establishment of the College of Arms, were confirmed. The officer would record the information clearly and make detailed notes that could be entered into the records of the College of Arms when the party returned to London.
An example of the text of a herald's visitation writ is the following, issued by Edward Bysshe, then Clarenceux King of Arms, dated 1 July 1664",history
Trabancos (river),"The Trabancos is a river in Spain that flows between the Zapardiel and the Guareña rivers, and is a tributary of the Duero river. The source of the Trabancos is in Moraña, a region in the north of the province of Ávila, near Blascomillán. The Trabancos is at an elevation of approximately 1,100 metres (3,600 ft), is approximately 85 kilometres (53 mi) long and, although its river bed is stable, only has a constant water flow during and immediately after torrential rains.

Fluvial geomorphology
From its source in the province of Ávila, to its mouth in the village of Pollos (""Village of Chickens"" in Spanish) in the Vallisoletana (""confluence of waters"") region, the course of the Trabancos is markedly affected by a geologic fault originating in the Tertiary era—likely pre-Pliocene that, like most of the observed faults of that geological era, follows a NNE-SSW direction. As shown in the graph below, the fault separates material laid down during the Oligocene epoch on the right margin, from material laid down during the Miocene epoch on the left margin. The surface level represents material deposited during the Quaternary period.
Archeological research in areas that surround the Trabancos River, between the villages of Castrejón and Pollos (Valladolid province) have been compared with the specialized bibliography and the published geological charts (infra). This produced identified a sequence of river terraces as follows, on the left hand margin of the chart: TT-1 platform (the most ancient, at +35/40 meters over the flood plain); the TT-2 platform (the second one at +25/30 meters); the TT-3 platform (at +15 meters over the floodplain); and the TT-4 platform (at +10 meters, the last and most recent).
The right hand margin of the designated chart depicts a gravel plateau present along the middle and final courses of the Trabancos River. The scientist Alfredo Pérez-Gonzalez named this formation ""Superficie de Alaejos"" (""The Plateau of Alaejos"", after a nearby village). The Alaejos Plateau incorporates a number of different types of materials, including red argillic soil and a colluvium buildup of gravels with rounded stones of quartz and quartzite.
The terraces of the Trabancos River only occur on the left hand side of the valley. Their sediments overlie Miocene sediments. This is the result of a hard slope in the opposite margin, where the terrain is heavily eroded, which renders the formation and maintenance of river terraces impossible.

Of the previously mentioned river terraces, the one known as TT-4 is only visible near Narros del Castillo (Ávila). Terrace TT-3 is the best preserved of the lot; although its height on the bed of the stream is not constant, it clearly stands out on the floodplain. Terrace TT-2 is quite well preserved as well, although it has been more heavily sculptured by other small tributaries of the Trabancos River. By contrast, terrace TT-1 is greatly eroded; although some sections survive to the south of the municipality of Al",history
Democratic legitimacy of the European Union,"The question of whether the governance of the European Union (EU) lacks democratic legitimacy has been debated since the time of the European Economic Community in the late 1970s. This led in part to an elected European Parliament being created in 1979 and given the power to approve or reject EU legislation. Since then, usage of the term has broadened to describe newer issues facing the European Union. Voter turnout at the elections to the European Parliament fell consecutively at every election from the first in 1979 up to 2014 when it hit a low of 42.54%, before finally rising in 2019. The 2014 turnout figure is lower than that of any national election in the 27 countries of the European Union, where turnout at national elections averages 68% across the EU.
Opinions differ as to whether the EU has a democratic deficit or how it should be remedied if it exists. Some scholars argue that the EU does not suffer from a democratic deficit as it is more constrained by its plural structure of checks and balances than any national polity. The EU is an intergovernmental institutional framework where democratically elected national governments bargain with each other. According to Majone, non-accountable institutions, such as the European Commission or the Court of Justice, are insulated from democratic contestation to achieve greater efficiency and protect minority rights. Some Pro-Europeans (i.e. those in favour of the EU) argue that the European Union should reform its institutions to make them more accountable, while Eurosceptics argue that the EU should reduce its powers and often campaign for withdrawal from the EU.

Use and meaning of the term
The phrase ""democratic deficit"" is cited as having first been used in 1977 by the Young European Federalists in their Manifesto, which was drafted by Richard Corbett. In 1979 it was used by David Marquand in reference to the then European Economic Community, the forerunner of the European Union. He argued that the European Parliament (then the Assembly) suffered from a democratic deficit as it was not directly elected by the citizens of the Community. 'Democratic deficit', in relation to the European Union, refers to a perceived lack of accessibility to the ordinary citizen, or lack of representation of the ordinary citizen, and lack of accountability of European Union institutions. Generally, the term 'democratic deficit' describes when there is a gap between the electorate's idea of what a democracy should be, and their perceived conception of how their democracy is currently performing.

Constitutional nature of the democratic deficit
In the European Union, there are two sources of democratic legitimacy: the European Parliament, chosen by the electorates of the individual EU countries; and the Council of the European Union (the ""Council of Ministers""), together with the European Council (of heads of national governments), that represent the peoples of the individual states.

League tag,"League Tag is the name of two distinct modified version of rugby league football. Both versions of League Tag maintain the basic structure of rugby league, and replace physical tackling with an alternate means to end each play.
The northern hemisphere version of League Tag was developed the rugby league club of University College Cork in Ireland, whilst the southern hemisphere version was created by the New South Wales Country Rugby League in Australia, with the international laws now overseen by the National Rugby League.

League Tag (Australia)
League Tag (Australia) replaces tackling with the removal of one of two tags carried on an opponent's hips, attached directly to specific League Tag shorts with Velcro patches, but otherwise retains almost all other rules of traditional rugby league (such as kicking). A number of additional rules are also added relating to the specific issues associated with a tag based game.

Origin
League Tag (Australia) was developed by the Western Australian Rugby League for the 2002 season after the demise of the women's tackle competition. The first competition was won by Wahine Toa. In 2004 the first representative side was selected to do a promotional tour to South Australia. By 2005 all Perth clubs were fielding a women's League Tag team. The first League Tag competitions in NSW started in the late 2000s. One of the earliest competitions, in the Group 9 area, commenced in 2008.

Competitions and Development
League Tag (Australia) competitions for ladies are held throughout winter across all Country Rugby League Groups in New South Wales at senior level, whilst most areas also have junior competitions for girls start from as young as under 8s. Other leagues, including mixed leagues also exist in spring and summer months. There are now over 9000 female players registered in country New South Wales League Tag competitions.

Rules
The rules of League Tag (Australia) are largely the same of standard rugby league, including field goals, goal kicking and kicking in general play. The most significant changes are a reduction of players per side from 13 to 11 and elimination of scrums, whilst additional rules such as prohibitions on grabbing clothing, fending of tags and performing 360-degree turns are added. Games are played over two 25-minute periods.

League Tag (Ireland)
League Tag (Ireland) uses tagging the ball to affect a tackle. This method for effecting a tackle, rather than simply any ‘touch’ or the removal of a tag from the hips of an opponent was chosen because upper body tackling and stopping the ball in the tackle is such a feature of modern rugby league. 
Unlike touch football and tag rugby, league tag allows ball carriers to try to prevent the ball from being tagged by holding-off a defender or knocking a defenders arm away. However, ‘hand-offs’ or ‘fends’ to the face, by the ball carrier are not allowed.
Defenders can hold on to a ball carrier whilst trying to tag the ball, but they are not allowed to att",sports
Cigar Box method,"The Cigar Box Method is a toolkit which consists of a series of spreadsheets to help entrepreneurs, notably those in agribusiness in emerging markets, to calculate the costs of goods, margins, contribution, break-even quantity and profitability. It can be used for a single product or a complete portfolio of products. There are six Cigar Box (CB) categories:

CB1: cost price analysis for one single product,
CB2: contribution analysis for a range of products,
CB3: daily monitoring of cost price for a range of products,
CB4: investment analysis and financial projections with yearly cash flow,
CB5: cost price based value chain analysis,
CB6: customer satisfaction analysis.

Origins
The Cigar Box Method was developed by Olivier van Lieshout and Anushik Tadevosyan. The method derives its name from pioneers in the 17th century Dutch Golden Age who were discussing foreign business deals while sipping coffee and smoking a cigar. When they needed to make quick business calculations, they often used the bottom side of the cigar box to convince investors about the profitability of their business ideas in a quick, concise and convincing manner.

History and current use
The method was first used in 1999 as an analytical tool during a course on foreign direct investment  (FDI) at the Wageningen University. It analyzed the suitability, including a risk analysis and potential benefits, of specific agricultural production processes for foreign investors. Between 1999 and 2012 over 180 students were trained in the use of the Cigar Box Method. It has since developed into a business analysis tool with multiple purposes and used by various targets groups: as analytical tool for foreign investors and bankers, as business planning tool for fruit and vegetable processing factories and business development service providers. An adapted version for women entrepreneurs in Africa has been developed recently. The method is described in the Agribusiness Handbook for Fruit and Vegetable Processing published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The Cigar Box is being used daily by Bakery Initiatives Group as a navigator to bakery profit. Since 1999, over 500 people from all over the world have trained in the use of the Cigar Box Method during courses carried out by Wageningen Centre for Development Innovation (WCDI).

Profit parameters
The Cigar Box Method of profit calculation uses only five parameters:

P =  Price (per unit)
VC = Variable cost (per unit)
FC = Fixed cost (per period)
q =  Quantity (in units per period)
T =  Tax (as % of profit).
More specifically, in (food) processing business, there are three types of variable cost: VC1 = Raw Materials and Ingredients, VC2 = costs of processing inputs into outputs, VC3 = costs of packaging materials, VC4 = cost of delivery. The fixed cost (FC) are also divided into three types: FC1 = depreciation of fixed assets, FC2 = interests paid, FC3 = overheads (salaries, transport, maintenance, ...), FC4 = cost of sales, mark",economics
Gilded Age,"In United States history, the Gilded Age is the period from about 1865 to 1902, which occurred between the Reconstruction era and the Progressive Era. It was named by 1920s historians after Mark Twain's 1873 novel The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today. Historians saw late 19th-century economic expansion as a time of materialistic excesses marked by widespread political corruption.
It was a time of rapid economic growth, especially in the Northern and Western United States. As American wages grew much higher than those in Europe, especially for skilled workers, and industrialization demanded an increasingly skilled labor force, the period saw an influx of millions of European immigrants. The rapid expansion of industrialization led to real wage growth of 40% from 1860 to 1890 and spread across the increasing labor force. The average annual wage per industrial worker (including men, women, and children) rose from $380 in 1880 ($12,381 in 2024 dollars) to $584 in 1890 ($19,738 in 2024 dollars), a gain of 59%. The Gilded Age was also an era of significant poverty, especially in the South, and growing inequality, as millions of immigrants poured into the United States, and the high concentration of wealth became more visible and contentious.
Railroads were the major growth industry, with the factory system, oil, mining, and finance increasing in importance. Immigration from Europe and the Eastern United States led to the rapid growth of the West based on farming, ranching, and mining. Labor unions became increasingly important in the rapidly growing industrial cities. Two major nationwide depressions—the Panic of 1873 and the Panic of 1893—interrupted growth and caused social and political upheavals.
The South remained economically devastated after the American Civil War; the region's economy became increasingly tied to commodities like food and building materials, cotton for thread and fabrics, and tobacco production, all of which suffered from low prices. With the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877 and the rise of Jim Crow laws, African American people in the South were stripped of political power and voting rights, and were left severely economically disadvantaged.
The political landscape was notable in that despite rampant corruption, election turnout was comparatively high among all classes (though the extent of the franchise was generally limited to men), and national elections featured two similarly sized parties. The dominant issues were cultural (especially regarding prohibition, education, and ethnic or racial groups) and economic (tariffs and money supply). Urban politics were tied to rapidly growing industrial cities, which increasingly fell under control of political machines. In business, powerful nationwide trusts formed in some industries. Unions crusaded for the eight-hour working day, and the abolition of child labor; middle-class reformers demanded civil service reform, prohibition of liquor and beer, and women's suffrage.

Class collaboration,"Class collaboration is a principle of social organization based upon the belief that the division of society into a hierarchy of social classes is a positive and essential aspect of civilization.

Fascist support
Class collaboration is one of the main pillars of social architecture in fascism. In the words of Benito Mussolini, fascism ""affirms the irremediable, fruitful, and beneficent inequality of men"". Given this premise, fascists conclude that the preservation of social hierarchy is in all of the classes' interests and therefore all classes should collaborate in its defense: the lower and the higher classes should accept their roles and perform their respective duties.
In fascist thought, the principle of class collaboration is combined with ultranationalism. The stability and the prosperity of the nation was seen as the ultimate purpose of collaboration between classes.
Class collaboration implies National Syndicalism as the preferred model for the economy. The state, having a non-class character, would mediate between employers and employees. Among other things, such mediation would entail disallowing strikes by employees and lockouts by employers; setting up state-run corporations/syndicates as the sole representatives of given industries; and allowing only state-run labor unions to represent employee interests.

Communist opposition
Communists ideologically oppose class collaboration, advocating class struggle and favoring a classless society.
The chief criticism communists wield against class collaboration is that it posits that the state alone can reconcile class antagonism in society and that the strife that gives rise to communism can be harmonized. For communists, the state is a tool used by the bourgeois class, meaning that the state will inevitably favor the employers over employees in class disputes.   
Some Marxists use the term ""class collaboration"" pejoratively, to describe working-class organisations that do not pursue class struggle. In this sense, the term has connotations of collaborationism. At the same time, communists do not necessarily reject all alliances between classes. Some communists argue that in a country with a large peasant population, the transition to communism can be accomplished by an alliance between two classes, namely the peasantry and the proletariat, united against the bourgeois class. Mao Zedong's New Democracy concept calls for ""the peasantry, the proletariat, the petty bourgeoisie and national and patriotic elements from the bourgeoisie to collectively operate for the building of a socialist society"".

Other cases
Modern social democracy (Third-Way) and one-nation conservatism also support class collaboration.

Gulbenkian commission,"The Gulbenkian Commission sought to address inadequacies in the organization of the social science disciplines that developed in the nineteenth century by indicating a direction for social scientific inquiry for the next 50 years. It was founded by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. It held three meetings in 1994 and 1995.

Members
Its members included Immanuel Wallerstein (chair), Calestous Juma, Evelyn Fox Keller, Jürgen Kocka, Dominique Lecourt, Valentin Y. Mudimbe, Kinhide Mushakoji, Ilya Prigogine, Peter J. Taylor, Michel-Rolph Trouillot. Six of them were drawn from the social sciences, two from the natural sciences and two from the humanities. The commission sought to produce a book length work that would identify new directions for the organization of knowledge in the next fifty years. The report was published in 1996 by Stanford University as the book, Open the Social Sciences by Immanuel Wallerstein. To foster international debate, the report has been published in numerous languages including English, French, Portuguese, German, Dutch, Czech, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Romanian, Serbocroat, Turkish, and Japanese.

Debate
The ideas in the report have stimulated debate around the world. For example, in the Indian Magazine Frontline, Sundar Sarukkai discussed its conclusions and applicability to the Indian context, which he criticizes for being cliquish and unprofessional. In 2006 Michael Burawoy, at Berkeley, offered a highly critical perspective: ""We hear nothing about how and where this new knowledge will be produced. Nor do we hear for whom this knowledge will be produced, nor for what ends. Instead we have an abstract and totalizing utopia that reflects the concerns of Western academics, perched high up in the ivory tower, seemingly unaware that the fortress beneath them – supporting them -- was under siege"". This comment was made in spite of the fact that the commission itself included academics from the Caribbean, Africa, and East Asia, as well as Europe and North America. Richard Lee suggests concrete ways that the Commission's goal of breaking down barriers between the disciplines of the social sciences might be achieved.

Gerontechnology,"Gerontechnology, also called gerotechnology is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic as well as a professional field that combines various disciplines of gerontology and technology. Sustainability of an aging society depends on our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including assistive technology and inclusive design, for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort as well as safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to health, housing, mobility, communication, leisure, work and also the personality/individual dispositions of older people. Gerontechnology is most frequently identified as a subset of HealthTech and is -- since the 2010s -- more commonly referred to as AgeTech or Agetech in Europe and the United States. Research outcomes form the basis for designers, builders, engineers, manufacturers, and those in the health professions (nursing, medicine, gerontology, geriatrics, environmental psychology, developmental psychology, etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of ages.

Description
Gerontechnology is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human health and physical as well as emotional well-being. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress morbidity and to increase vitality and quality of life throughout the lifespan. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the cost of care.
The overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of domains of human activity: (1) health & self-esteem, housing & activities of daily living, communication & governance, mobility & transport, work & leisure, as well as (2) technology interventions or impact levels (enhancement & satisfaction, prevention & engagement, compensation & assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied evidence-based research findings that aid in the development of products and services.
Gerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as Assistive Technology (for the compensation & assistance and the care support & care organisation rows of the matrix), Everybodytech, Technology for All (for example Technology 4 All.org) and Universal Design for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.

Gerontological design
Gerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and design research methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.
Gerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support older users in the built environment.  Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or i",technology
Upper Őrség,"Upper Őrség (Hungarian: Felső-Őrség, [ˈfɛlsøː ˈøːrʃeːɡ]; German: Wart) is a traditional ethnographic region and a small Hungarian language island in southern Burgenland, Austria. It consists of the town of Oberwart (Hun: Felsőőr) and the two villages of Unterwart (Hun: Alsóőr) and Siget in der Wart (Hun: Őrisziget). The population of the three settlements was 7694 according to the 2001 census, of whom 1922 people (25%) belonged to the ethnic Hungarian minority. The economic and cultural center of the microregion is Oberwart/Felsőőr.

History
In the 11th century the region was part of the border zone (gyepű) of the Kingdom of Hungary. The mainly uninhabited frontier was defended by free border guard communities called őrök és lövők (guards and archers). In contemporary Latin documents they are called spiculatores and sagittarii. They were probably related to the border guards of the eastern frontier, the Székelys.
The descendants of the guards are still living in the villages of the Upper Őrség (and in the Lower Őrség or simply Őrség in present-day Hungary). The archers later assimilated into the German population. They lived around the villages of Alsólövő (now Unterschützen) and Felsölövő (now Oberschützen). There were also other border guard communities elsewhere.
In the early Middle Ages the gyepű became part of the county of Vas. Upper Őrség belonged to this county until 1921.
The community of the őrs were granted the privileges of nobility by King Charles I of Hungary at the beginning of the 14th century. They were free of serfdom and taxation. These privileges were acknowledged by Rudolph I in 1582.
Their nobility differentiated the őrs from the people of the neighbouring villages, and was important in the formation of their distinct identity. Some families kept track of their noble origins even in the 20th century. In the village of Alsóőr/Unterwart several families trace back their origin to medieval times, for example the Balikó, Balla, Benedek, Benkő, Deáki, Farkas, Gaál, Gangoly, Gyáki, Györög, Heritz, Kelemen, Leéb, Moór, Német, Paál, Palank, Seper, Szabó, Takács and Zarka families.
Upper Őrség became a language island in the 16th century. At that time the neighbouring territories were already populated with Germans. After the devastating Ottoman war in 1532 Croatian settlers arrived. The őrs became an isolated community in this new situation. They spoke their distinct dialect and practised strict endogamy until at least the middle of the 20th century.
The őrs took part in the Hungarian wars of independence against the Habsburgs in the Rákóczi Uprising (1703-1711) and in the Revolutionary war of 1848–49.

20th century: decline
At the end of the 19th century the community began to dwindle, due to the decline of small crafts and the frittering away of the noble properties between the children. Several new Hungarian civil servants and intellectuals arrived in Felsőőr which was the centre of local government but the newcomers remained ""st",history
Philosophy and economics,"Philosophy and economics studies topics such as public economics, behavioural economics, rationality, justice, history of economic thought, rational choice, the appraisal of economic outcomes, institutions and processes, the status of highly idealized economic models, the ontology of economic phenomena and the possibilities of acquiring knowledge of them.
It is useful to divide philosophy of economics in this way into three subject matters which can be regarded respectively as branches of action theory, ethics (or normative social and political philosophy), and philosophy of science. Economic theories of rationality, welfare, and social choice defend substantive philosophical theses often informed by relevant philosophical literature and of evident interest to those interested in action theory, philosophical psychology, and social and political philosophy.
Economics is of special interest to those interested in epistemology and philosophy of science both because of its detailed peculiarities and because it has many of the overt features of the natural sciences, while its object consists of social phenomena. In any empirical setting, the epistemic assumptions of financial economics (and related applied financial disciplines) are relevant, and are further discussed under the Epistemology of finance.

Scope
Definition and ontology of economics
The question usually addressed in any subfield of philosophy (the philosophy of X) is ""what is X?"".  A philosophical approach to the question ""what is economics?"" is less likely to produce an answer than it is to produce a survey of the definitional and territorial difficulties and controversies. Similar considerations apply as a prologue to further discussion of methodology in a subject. Definitions of economics have varied over time from the modern origins of the subject, reflecting programmatic concerns and distinctions of expositors.
Ontological questions continue with further ""what is..."" questions addressed at fundamental economic phenomena, such as ""what is (economic) value?"" or ""what is a market?"". While it is possible to respond to such questions with real verbal definitions, the philosophical value of posing such questions actually aims at shifting entire perspectives as to the nature of the foundations of economics. In the rare cases that attempts at ontological shifts gain wide acceptance, their ripple effects can spread throughout the entire field of economics.

Methodology and epistemology of economics
An epistemology deals with how we know things. In the philosophy of economics this means asking questions such as: what kind of a ""truth claim"" is made by economic theories – for example, are we claiming that the theories relate to reality or perceptions? How can or should we prove economic theories – for example, must every economic theory be empirically verifiable? How exact are economic theories and can they lay claim to the status of an exact science – for example, are economic predictions as r",economics

The noun eortology comes from the ancient Greek compound of the term ἑορτή ""feast"" and the suffix -logia which means ""study"". Thus, eortology is the study of festivals, especially their history and meaning in the church year.

History
Christian heortology dates back at least to Johann Adam Trummerer's Eortologia Anagrammaike published in 1607.
German Lutheran theologian Michael Lilienthal published a German-language heortology in 1724 to show the origin of Christian celebrations. Wilhelm Dibelius published the second eortological study of the Christian rite in German in 1841. In parallel with modern archaeology, studies also examined the question of the rites of Greek and Roman antiquity, following the work of August Mommsen, published in Leipzig in 1864 under the title of Heortologie: Antiquarische Untersuchungen über die städtischen Feste der Athener.
Christian heortology particularly developed at the instigation of the Jesuit Nikolaus Nilles and the liturgical movement from the end of the 19th century. Prominent heortologists were the Sulpician Pierre Batiffol who published History of the Roman Breviary in 1893, Hartmann Grisar who published Analecta Romana in 1899, and the canon Louis Duchesne who published studies on the Origins of Christian worship. German scholar Karl Adam Heinrich Kellner published Heortologie, oder, das Kirchenjahr und die Heiligenfeste in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1901.
As the Second Ecumenical Vatican Council approached, many heortologists published major works, such as Missarum Sollemnia: Genetic Explanation of the Roman Mass by the Jesuit Josef Andreas Jungmann, published first in German in 1948. At the same time, Mircea Eliade focused on the importance of religious thought on contemporary society through his heortological studies of primitive religions.

Relations with other sciences
Heortology is related to many other disciplines such as social anthropology, astronomy, history and liturgy.

Anthropology
Heortology has considerable importance in anthropology, as it associates time cycles with civilizations and civilizational patterns. Sociology, with Émile Durkheim as its precursor, raises the question of the importance of religion and, in particular, of religious celebrations, in society.
Anthropological philosophy questions the link that exists between collective celebrations and individual questions and fears. To what extent is the general perception of truths reflected in cults, rites and customs? A precursor of this problematic was Johan Huizinga with his book Homo Ludens. The study of the feasts that narrate the life of a saint or other character is of paramount importance, both from a philosophical and sociological point of view.

Prices received index,"The prices received index is an index that measures changes in the prices received for crops and livestock within the United States. The National Agricultural Statistics Service currently publishes the index on a 1990-92 = 100 base. A ratio of the prices received index to the prices paid index on the 1990-92 base that is greater than 100% indicates that farm commodity prices have increased at a faster rate than farm input prices. When the ratio is less than 100%, farm input prices are increasing a more rapid pace than farm commodity prices. The prices received index and the prices paid index are used to calculate the parity ratio.

Cash crop,"A cash crop, also called profit crop, is an agricultural crop which is grown to sell for profit. It is typically purchased by parties separate from a farm. The term is used to differentiate a marketed crop from a staple crop (""subsistence crop"") in subsistence agriculture, which is one fed to the producer's own livestock or grown as food for the producer's family.
In earlier times, cash crops were usually only a small (but vital) part of a farm's total yield, while today, especially in developed countries and among smallholders almost all crops are mainly grown for revenue. In the least developed countries, cash crops are usually crops which attract demand in more developed nations, and hence have some export value.
Prices for major cash crops are set in international trade markets with global scope, with some local variation (termed as ""basis"") based on freight costs and local supply and demand balance. A consequence of this is that a nation, region, or individual producer relying on such a crop may suffer low prices should a bumper crop elsewhere lead to excess supply on the global markets. This system has been criticized by traditional farmers. Coffee is an example of a product that has been susceptible to significant commodity futures price variations.

Globalization
Issues involving subsidies and trade barriers on such crops have become controversial in discussions of globalization. Many developing countries take the position that the current international trade system is unfair because it has caused tariffs to be lowered in industrial goods while allowing for low tariffs and agricultural subsidies for agricultural goods. This makes it difficult for a developing nation to export its goods overseas, and forces developing nations to compete with imported goods which are exported from developed nations at artificially low prices. The practice of exporting at artificially low prices is known as dumping, and is illegal in most nations. Controversy over this issue led to the collapse of the Cancún trade talks in 2003, when the Group of 22 refused to consider agenda items proposed by the European Union unless the issue of agricultural subsidies was addressed.

Per climate zones
Arctic
The Arctic climate is generally not conducive for the cultivation of cash crops. However, one potential cash crop for the Arctic is Rhodiola rosea, a hardy plant used as a medicinal herb that grows in the Arctic. There is currently consumer demand for the plant, but the available supply is less than the demand (as of 2011).

Temperate
Cash crops grown in regions with a temperate climate include many cereals (wheat, rye, corn, barley, oats), oil-yielding crops (e.g. grapeseed, mustard seeds), vegetables (e.g. potatoes), lumber yielding trees (e.g. Spruce, Pines, Firs), tree fruit or top fruit (e.g. apples, cherries) and soft fruit (e.g. strawberries, raspberries).

Edmund Andrews (surgeon),"Edmund Andrews (April 22, 1824 – January 22, 1904) was an American doctor, a pioneer in surgery and medical education of the Western United States. He was one of the founders of the Medical Department of the Northwestern University.

Biography
Andrews was born in Putney, Vermont, a son of Betsy Lathrop and Rev. Elisha D. Andrews, the Congregational minister of that town. There, and in Rochester, New York, he received his preliminary education. He was from the first devoted to botany and geology. At the age of 17 his family moved to central Michigan. While studying at the University of Michigan he excelled in mathematics and natural sciences and was made president of the literary society of his college. He graduated with the degree of B.A. in 1849. He entered the office of Dr. Z. Pitcher, Detroit, in 1850, and attended lectures in the Medical Department of the University of Michigan. At the end of his first year he was made demonstrator of anatomy; received his degree in medicine in the following year, 1851, and was then made lecturer in comparative anatomy. He received his degree of Master of Arts in 1852 from the university, and two years later was made professor of comparative anatomy. He was one of the founders of the Michigan State Medical Society, and in 1853 began the publication of the Peninsular Journal of Medical and Collateral Sciences.
In 1855 he was appointed demonstrator of anatomy in Rush Medical College, but resigned after one year and devoted himself to practice, especially to surgery. Soon after his arrival in Chicago he aided in founding the Chicago Academy of Science, and was its first president, serving several times in this capacity. A short time after this he, in connection with Dr. Horace Wardner, established a charity dispensary, and a private dissecting room, where he taught a class in anatomy. He was one of the founders of the Chicago Medical College, and was its first professor of surgery. This latter position he held actively or emeritus up to his death. He was also surgeon to the Mercy Hospital. When the Civil War broke out he was made surgeon of the First Illinois Light Artillery, but after a year was obliged to resign by reason of illness incurred in the service. He was the first to make and keep complete medical records of the sick and wounded in war, and his
records were accepted by the surgeon general and formed the basis on which records of that office have since been kept. He was a pioneer in practical antisepsis, and was the first man in the west to employ Lister's method after its exploitation.

Andrews was for many years a member of the American Medical Association, Michigan State Medical Society, Illinois State Medical Society, the Chicago Medical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Chicago Academy of Science, Wisconsin Academy of Science, etc. For a number of years he was a trustee of Northwestern University. He contributed largely to medical literature. Andrews collected ",medicine
Theoretical linguistics,"Theoretical linguistics is a term in linguistics that, like the related term general linguistics, can be understood in different ways. Both can be taken as a reference to the theory of language, or the branch of linguistics that inquires into the nature of language and seeks to answer fundamental questions as to what language is, or what the common ground of all languages is. The goal of theoretical linguistics can also be the construction of a general theoretical framework for the description of language.
Another use of the term depends on the organisation of linguistics into different sub-fields. The term theoretical linguistics is commonly juxtaposed with applied linguistics. This perspective implies that the aspiring language professional, e.g. a student, must first learn the theory i.e. properties of the linguistic system, or what Ferdinand de Saussure called internal linguistics. This is followed by practice, or studies in the applied field. The dichotomy is not fully unproblematic because language pedagogy, language technology and other aspects of applied linguistics also include theory.
Similarly, the term general linguistics is used to distinguish core linguistics from other types of study. However, because college and university linguistics is largely distributed with the institutes and departments of a relatively small number of national languages, some larger universities also offer courses and research programmes in 'general linguistics' which may cover exotic and minority languages, cross-linguistic studies and various other topics outside the scope of the main philological departments.

Fields of linguistics proper
When the concept of theoretical linguistics is taken to refer to core or internal linguistics, it means the study of the parts of the language system. This traditionally means phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics. Pragmatics and discourse can also be included; delimitation varies between institutions. Furthermore, Saussure's definition of general linguistics consists of the dichotomy of synchronic and diachronic linguistics, thus including historical linguistics as a core issue.

Linguistic theories
There are various frameworks of linguistic theory which include a general theory of language and a general theory of linguistic description. Current humanistic approaches include theories within structural linguistics and functional linguistics. In addition to the humanistic approaches of structural linguistics and functional linguistics, the field of theoretical linguistics encompasses other frameworks and perspectives. Evolutionary linguistics is one such framework that investigates the origins and development of language from an evolutionary and cognitive perspective. It incorporates various models within generative grammar, which seeks to explain language structure through formal rules and transformations. Cognitive linguistics and cognitive approaches to grammar, on the other hand, focuses on the relationship betw",science
Qianball,"Qianball is a racket sport similar to tennis or squash. The sport  originated from Chinese Qianlongball, and was popularized in Denmark with their own organization, the KFUM.The game can be described as a mixture between tennis and squash or as squash without walls. The game can be played by two or four players, or by a single person practicing. Qianball can be played on any flat hard surface, indoors or outdoors, no matter the weather. 
The game is played on a court a little smaller than a tennis court with both players placed on the same side of the net. The player side of the net measures 7.6 * 7.8 m, and the other side of the net should be app. 10 * 12 m, but there are no exact rules for this.   
The game involves:

One court measuring 7.6 by 7.8 meters in the player zone and 10 by 12 meters in the ball zone
Two or four players playing respectively single or double
One ballbag with weight or floor embedded hook
A qianball racket for each player
A qianball ball with rubber band
A net or similar at a height of 81 cm
The game is played by placing the ball bag 2.1 metres from the net in the so-called Qianball point. The end of the rubber band is attached to the turning rings or the floor embedded hook. 
The players are positioned on the same side of the net as in squash and they take turns to serve 2 consecutive serves before changing sides. The game is decided in three sets to 15, playing with a running score. 
The ball may not touch the ground in the player zone or the opposing player will score a point, and may only touch the ground once in the ball zone.
Denmark was the first country in Europe where Qianball came to from China. In Denmark the game is organised under KFUM (Danish branch of YMCA sport). In China there are roughly one million players.",sports
Producer support estimate,"The producer support estimate (PSE) (formerly producer subsidy equivalent) is an indicator of the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and the state to agricultural producers, measured at the farm gate level, arising from policy measures that support agriculture, regardless of their nature, objectives or impacts on farm production or income. Examples include market price support, and payments based on output, area planted, animal numbers, inputs, or farm income. PSEs, which are updated and published annually by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, can be expressed in monetary terms: as a ratio to the value of gross farm receipts valued at farm gate prices, including budgetary support (percentage PSE); or, as a ratio to the value of gross farm receipts valued at world market prices, without budgetary support.

The College of Psychiatrists of Ireland,"The College of Psychiatrists of Ireland is a professional body established in 2009 to promote excellence in the practice of psychiatry in the Republic of Ireland and to provide secondary education in psychiatry. It is the only organization recognized by the Medical Council and the Health Service Executive for competence assurance and training in psychiatry in Ireland.
The college is a not-for-profit professional membership organization and a registered charity. It provides membership to qualified doctors who have further trained to specialize in psychiatry or are currently part of a specialist training programme in psychiatry.

Activities
The college is actively involved in public discourse and legislative debates affecting mental health in Ireland. It has taken public positions on matters such as the ""Dying with Dignity"" Bill and cannabis use. For example, it argued that euthanasia is not compatible with good medical care and could put vulnerable patients at risk, maintaining that a dignified death is achievable with palliative care. The college caused controversy when it claimed that cannabis is the ""gravest threat"" to the mental health of young people in Ireland, sparking debates about the drug's impact on mental health and the government's approach to drug issues.
The college has criticized the Irish government for the underfunding and under-resourcing of mental health services in the country, calling for a ""radical overhaul"" of the system. The ""neglected state"" of mental health units and lengthy waiting lists was called out, and increased funding and improved governance and oversight was proposed. John Hillery, the son of former Irish president Patrick Hillery and the president of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, resigned from his clinical post within the HSE in protest over the treatment of staff and patients within the State's mental health services.

Platform capitalism,"Platform capitalism refers to the activities of companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Uber, Airbnb, Amazon and others to operate as platforms. In this business model both hardware and software are used as a foundation (platform) for other actors to conduct their own business.
Platform capitalism has been both heralded as beneficial and denounced as detrimental by various authors. The trends identified in platform capitalism have similarities with those described under the heading of surveillance capitalism. Technology companies build platforms that entire industries rely on, and those industries can easily collapse due to the decisions of those technology companies.
The possible effect of platform capitalism on open science has been discussed.
Platform capitalism has been contrasted with platform cooperativism. Companies that try to focus on fairness and sharing, instead of just profit motive, are described as cooperatives, whereas more traditional and common companies that focus solely on profit, like Airbnb and Uber, are platform capitalists (or cooperativist platforms vs capitalist platforms). In turn, projects like Wikipedia, which rely on unpaid labor of volunteers, can be classified as commons-based peer-production initiatives.: 31, 36

National Biotechnology Development Agency,"National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) is an agency established in 2001 under the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, that implements policies, explores resources, conducts research, promotes, coordinates and develops biotechnology in Nigeria.
The NABDA also controls and supervises the introduction of genetically modified organisms into Nigeria.

Background and history
In July 2019, NABDA announced their invention of Anaerobic Digestion Technology digesters which can convert organic wastes to biogas.
In May 2020, NABDA worked with Nigeria Centre for Disease Control in the process of enabling local production of locally made testing kits for Coronavirus.
In March 2022, NABDA announced it was making research on reliable and affordable drugs for Lassa fever.
In December 2022, NABDA announced that they had locally produced a starter culture for the preparation of yoghurt with the two germs, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. In the same month, NABDA announced their livestock genetic experiments around artificial insemination for milk and meat improvement.
In January 2023, NABDA announced plans to release insect and drought-resistant maize to Nigerian farmers to improve food production. In the same month, they worked with National Committee on Naming, Registration and Release of Crop Varieties, Livestock Breed/Fisheries to release FARO68, a rice variety and 20 other crop varieties for farmers to boost food efficiency.

Leadership
Controversies
In June 2017, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested the then Director General of NABDA, Professor Lucy Jumeyi Ogbadu for alleged criminal conspiracy and diversion of N23 Million in public funds. This was part of a larger sum of N603 million naira. In an October 24, 2017 letter signed by the secretary of the EFCC, Ogbadu was absolved of any involvement in the alleged fraud. However, on January 9, 2018, it faulted the clearing and went on to file 49 charges against her. On August 30, 2021, a witness invited by the EFCC, Christopher Orji, the director of Bioresources Development Centre, Langtang, a sub agency under NABDA reportedly committed suicide.
In 2017, following the issuance of the permit for the commercialization of the genetically modified cotton, a group of 16 civil society organizations sued the National Biosafety Management Agency and National Biotechnology Development Agency. The court ruled in favour of the government agencies.
In November 2020, staff of NABDA protested citing unpaid promotion arrears, promotion examinations not being conducted, corruption and poor welfare as reasons.
In April 2022, Nnimmo Bassey decried NABDA's distribution of commercial quantities of Genetically Modified Cowpea to farmers without informing them on what the seeds were. Farmers went on to plant, harvest and sell the seeds without knowing they were GMCs. In September 2022, NABDA and other agencies insisted that such crops were safe for consumption and to t",technology
Environmental history,"Environmental history is the study of human interaction with the natural world over time, emphasising the active role nature plays in influencing human affairs and vice versa.
Environmental history first emerged in the United States out of the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and much of its impetus still stems from present-day global environmental concerns. The field was founded on conservation issues but has broadened in scope to include more general social and scientific history and may deal with cities, population or sustainable development. As all history occurs in the natural world, environmental history tends to focus on particular time-scales, geographic regions, or key themes. It is also a strongly multidisciplinary subject that draws widely on both the humanities and natural science.
The subject matter of environmental history can be divided into three main components. The first, nature itself and its change over time, includes the physical impact of humans on the Earth's land, water, atmosphere and biosphere. The second category, how humans use nature, includes the environmental consequences of increasing population, more effective technology and changing patterns of production and consumption. Other key themes are the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer communities to settled agriculture in the Neolithic Revolution, the effects of colonial expansion and settlements, and the environmental and human consequences of the Industrial and technological revolutions. Finally, environmental historians study how people think about nature – the way attitudes, beliefs and values influence interaction with nature, especially in the form of myths, religion and science.

Origin of name and early works
In 1967, Roderick Nash published Wilderness and the American Mind, a work that has become a classic text of early environmental history. In an address to the Organization of American Historians in 1969 (published in 1970) Nash used the expression ""environmental history"", although 1972 is generally taken as the date when the term was first coined. The 1959 book by Samuel P. Hays, Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890–1920, while being a major contribution to American political history, is now also regarded as a founding document in the field of environmental history. Hays is professor emeritus of History at the University of Pittsburgh. Alfred W. Crosby's book The Columbian Exchange (1972) is another key early work of environmental history.

Historiography
Brief overviews of the historiography of environmental history have been published by J. R. McNeill, Richard White, and J. Donald Hughes. In 2014 Oxford University Press published a volume of 25 essays in The Oxford Handbook of Environmental History.

Definition
There is no universally accepted definition of environmental history. In general terms it is a history that tries to explain why our environment is like it is and how humanity h",history
Flyover (Apple Maps),"Flyover is a feature on Apple Maps that allows users to view certain areas in a 3D setting. Flyover also allows users to take ""tours"" of these locations through the City Tours feature, showcasing various landmarks in the area. Imagery is provided through the use of planes, which collect fine data on buildings.

Initially founded in 2012, along with Apple Maps itself, Flyover now covers over 300 cities, landmarks, and parks across five of the six inhabited continents through a series of several expansions, notably in 2014, 2015 and 2019. Despite earlier issues, Flyover has been praised for its detail and uniqueness.

History
2012–2015
Flyover was announced along with Apple Maps at the WWDC 2012, and was also released alongside Maps in September 2012. The 10 initial cities that first received Flyover were Chicago, Copenhagen, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Montreal, Sacramento, San Francisco, Seattle and Sydney. More cities would receive Flyover in later years, with Apple often adding multiple cities to Flyover at a time. In addition to this initial release, Apple added the feature to other cities later in the year, including Toronto in Canada.
In 2013, Flyover was added to Paris, as well as smaller cities such as Indianapolis and Baltimore, totalling 16 cities in the United States, Germany, Canada, France and the UK. In addition, Flyover was also added to London, Barcelona, Cologne, Rome, and Madrid, as well as the city of Vancouver, in Canada the same year.
Flyover was added to several cities and national parks in New Zealand, France, the United States, South Africa, Sweden and Japan, including Cape Town and two Arizona National Parks in 2014, with Marseille, the second-largest city in France, receiving Flyover coverage later in the year as well, The capital of Japan, Tokyo, also received Flyover that year. along with Wellington, New Zealand and Yosemite National Park. In addition, the City Tours feature, which allows users to tour locations supported by the Flyover feature, was also added around this time.
South Africa, the only African nation to have Flyover, also first saw the feature with Cape Town in 2014, with Durban and Johannesburg receiving the feature in later years.
Flyover was added to over 20 cities and locations in 2015 in various cities mostly across the US and Western Europe, including Canberra and Venice. Flyover was also added to Budapest, in Hungary and Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic later in the year. In Italy, the cities of Florence and Genoa and Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany received Flyover that year as well.
Guadalajara, the largest city in Mexico to have the feature, also received Flyover in 2015. Japan also saw more cities with Flyover, with Nagoya, Osaka and Hiroshima receiving the feature in 2015 as well, and Mannheim and Stuttgart in Germany also received the feature that year.

History of the Ryukyu Islands,"This article is about the history of the Ryukyu Islands, located southwest of the main islands of Japan.

Etymology
The name ""Ryūkyū"" originates from Chinese writings.  The earliest references to ""Ryūkyū"" write the name as 琉虬 and 流求 (pinyin: Liúqiú; Jyutping: Lau4kau4, Middle Chinese: /ljuw gjuw/) in the Chinese history Book of Sui in 607.  It is a descriptive name, meaning ""glazed horn-dragon"".
The origin of the term ""Okinawa"" remains unclear, although ""Okinawa"" (Okinawan: Uchinaa) as a term was used in Okinawa. There was also a divine woman named ""Uchinaa"" in the book Omoro Sōshi, a compilation of ancient poems and songs from Okinawa Island. This suggests the presence of a divine place named Okinawa.  The Chinese monk Jianzhen, who traveled to Japan in the mid-8th century CE to promote Buddhism, wrote ""Okinawa"" as 阿児奈波 (anjenaʒpa). The Japanese map series Ryukyu Kuniezu labeled the island as 悪鬼納 (Wokinaha) in 1644. The current Chinese characters (kanji) for Okinawa (沖縄) were first written in the 1702 version of Ryukyu Kuniezu.

Early history
Prehistoric period
The ancestry of the modern-day Ryukyuan people is disputed. One theory claims that the earliest inhabitants of these islands crossed a prehistoric land bridge from modern-day China, with later additions of Austronesians, Micronesians, and Japanese merging with the population. The time when human beings appeared in Okinawa remains unknown. The earliest human bones were those of Yamashita Cave Man, about 32,000 years ago, followed by Pinza-Abu Cave Man, Miyakojima, about 26,000 years ago and Minatogawa Man, about 18,000 years ago. They probably came through China and were once considered to be the direct ancestors of those living in Okinawa. No stone tools were discovered with them. For the following 12 000 years, no trace of archaeological sites was discovered after the Minatogawa man site.

Okinawa midden culture
Okinawa midden culture or shell heap culture is divided into the early shell heap period corresponding to the Jōmon period of Japan and the latter shell heap period corresponding to the Yayoi period of Japan. However, the use of Jōmon and Yayoi of Japan is questionable in Okinawa.  In the former, it was a hunter-gatherer society, with wave-like opening Jōmon pottery. In the latter part of Jōmon period, archaeological sites moved near the seashore, suggesting the engagement of people in fishery.  In Okinawa, rice was not cultivated during the Yayoi period but began during the latter period of shell-heap age.  Shell rings for arms made of shells obtained in the Sakishima Islands, namely Miyakojima and Yaeyama islands, were imported by Japan. In these islands, the presence of shell axes, 2500 years ago, suggests the influence of a southeastern-Pacific culture.

Mythology, the Shunten Dynasty and the Eiso Dynasty
The first history of Ryukyu was written in Chūzan Seikan (""Mirrors of Chūzan""), which was compiled by Shō Shōken (1617–75), also known as Haneji Chōshū.  The Ryukyuan creati",history
Favorite son,"Favorite son (or favorite daughter) is a political term.
At the quadrennial American national political party conventions, a state delegation sometimes nominates a presidential candidate from the state, or less often from the state's region, who is not a viable candidate in the view of other delegations, and votes for this candidate in the initial ballot. The technique allows state leaders to negotiate with leading candidates in exchange for the delegation's support in subsequent ballots.
Serious candidates usually, but not always, avoided campaigning in favorite sons' states. If a party's leader in a state, usually the governor, was unsure of whom to support, as the favorite son the state party could avoid disputes. Conversely, a party leader who has chosen a candidate might become a favorite son to keep other candidates' campaigns out of the state, or prevent a rival local politician from becoming a favorite son. The favorite son may explicitly state that the candidacy is not viable, or that the favorite son is not a candidate at all. The favorite son may hope to receive the vice-presidential nomination, Cabinet post or other job, increase support for the favorite son's region or policies, or just the publicity from being nominated at the convention.
The technique was widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Since nationwide campaigns by candidates and binding primary elections have replaced brokered conventions, the technique has fallen out of use, as party rule changes in the early 1970s required candidates to have nominations from more than one state.
A politician whose electoral appeal derives from their native state, rather than their political views is called a ""favorite son"". For example, in the United States, a presidential candidate will usually win the support of their home state(s). A particularly notable instance of this occurred in 1984, when challenger Walter Mondale lost 49 of 50 states against popular incumbent Ronald Reagan, winning only his home state of Minnesota.

Nōgyōsha kobetsu shotoku hoshō seido,"The Nōgyōsha kobetsu shotoku hoshō seido (農業者戸別所得補償制度,, English, Farmers' Door-to-door Compensation System) is an agrarian policy to support farmers in Japan. It was proposed and implemented by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) which presented the bill to the Japanese Diet (parliament) in 2010, following its original inclusion in the DPJ's manifestos for both the 2007 Councillors and 2009 Representatives elections.
The bill was introduced in the Diet in October 2007, and the legislation passed in the House of Councillors in November, but it was defeated in the House of Representatives of Japan in May 2008. After the DPJ's victory in the 45th House of Representatives election in 2009, the policy began to be implemented in 2010 and will become fully effective in 2011.

Description
The law provides government subsidies to support farmers whose main agricultural product is rice, oats or soy beans, at a level depending on certain production targets which are decided by prefectural and city governments and municipalities based on a food self-sufficiency rate target.
The subsidies are calculated based on the difference between the nationwide average production cost and the nationwide average retail price. The payment has several additional components including a reward for quality, distribution method (e.g. selling in a direct marketing shop), effort of manufacturing (e.g. promotion of rice flour), expansion of management level, environmental conservation measures such as creation diversity, production of cereals that substitute for rice (includes rice for ground rice and animal feed rice), etc.

Contemporary condition
In the 2010 request for budget appropriations, a total of 800 million yen (US$561 billion) for paddy farming was allocated in the model countermeasure of the budget. The countermeasure consists of a ""rice farm income indemnity model programme"" and a project to raise self-sufficiency in field applications (水田利活用自給力向上事業).
The former covers farmers who produce rice subject to a production target, and the latter gives farm households whose products include oats, soy beans, rice powder, and rice for use as forage, subsidies at the same level of income as that of farmers producing rice as a primary product.
The government did not insist on full participation in the self-sufficiency project, and farmers may withdraw from the rice product subsidy scheme.
Every farmer participating in this scheme was given a basic subsidy at a rate of 10,000 yen per are (100 square metres).

Standard social science model,"The term standard social science model (SSSM) was first introduced by John Tooby and Leda Cosmides in the 1992 edited volume The Adapted Mind.  They used SSSM as a reference to social science philosophies related to the blank slate, relativism, social constructionism, and cultural determinism. They argue that those philosophies, capsulized within SSSM, formed the dominant theoretical paradigm in the development of the social sciences during the 20th century. According to their proposed SSSM paradigm, the mind is a general-purpose cognitive device shaped almost entirely by culture.
After establishing SSSM, Tooby and Cosmides make a case for replacing SSSM with the integrated model (IM), also known as the integrated causal model (ICM), which melds cultural and biological theories for the development of the mind. Supporters of SSSM include those who feel the term was conceived as a point of argument in support of ICM specifically and evolutionary psychology (EP) in general. There are criticisms that the allegation of SSSM is based on a straw man or rhetorical technique.

Alleged proponents
Steven Pinker names several prominent social scientists as proponents of the standard social science model, including John B. Watson, Margaret Mead, Franz Boas, B. F. Skinner, Richard Lewontin, John Money, and Stephen Jay Gould.

Alternative theoretical paradigm: the integrated model
The authors of The Adapted Mind have argued that the SSSM is now out of date and that a progressive model for the social sciences requires evolutionarily-informed models of nature-nurture interactionism, grounded in the computational theory of mind.  Tooby and Cosmides refer to this new model as the integrated model (IM).
Tooby and Cosmides provide several comparisons between the SSSM and the IM, including the following:

Criticism of the coining of the term
Richardson (2007) argues that, as proponents of evolutionary psychology (EP), evolutionary psychologists developed the SSSM as a rhetorical technique: ""The basic move is evident in Cosmides and Tooby's most aggressive brief for evolutionary psychology. They want us to accept a dichotomy between what they call the ""Standard Social Science Model"" (SSSM) and the ""Integrated Causal Model"" (ICM) they favor ... it offers a false dichotomy between a manifestly untenable view and their own.""
Wallace (2010) has also suggested the SSSM to be a false dichotomy and claims that ""scientists in the EP tradition wildly overstate the influence and longevity of what they call the Standard Social Science Model (essentially, behaviorism) of human cognition"".
Geoffrey Sampson argues that the SSSM is based on a straw man. He views Pinker's claim that the SSSM has been the dominant theoretical paradigm in the social sciences since the 1920s as ""completely untenable"". In his argument, Sampson cites British education policies in the 20th century that were guided by social scientists and which were based on the belief that children had in-built talents and",science
Hack-for-hire operation,"Hack-for-hire operations are services that provide clients with illicit access to information by infiltrating digital systems or networks, typically for a fee. This form of hacking on demand has seen a surge in popularity over recent years, with the trend being attributed to advancements in technology, growing digital connectivity, and increasing demand for corporate espionage and personal data breaches.

History
The concept of hack-for-hire services can be traced back to the early years of the internet, when hackers were contracted for a variety of reasons, such as to perform penetration tests which was considered ""ethical hacking""
. Over time, however, the scope of these operations expanded to include illegal activities, like industrial espionage, personal data breaches, and illicit political interference.

Operation
Hack-for-hire operations typically involve a client who pays a hacker or a group of hackers to infiltrate a specified digital system or network to gather information. The services offered by these hackers can range from simple password cracking to sophisticated techniques such as phishing, ransomware attacks, or advanced persistent threats (APTs).
Hack-for-hire operations often utilize the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines, to advertise their services and connect with potential clients. Transactions are typically made using cryptocurrencies to maintain anonymity.

Legality
Hack-for-hire services are typically considered illegal, as they involve unauthorized access to private digital systems and computer networks. They are generally punishable under the computer crime laws of many countries, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the United States and the Computer Misuse Act in the United Kingdom.

Recent developments
In 2023, an extensive Reuters investigation revealed a massive scheme of hack-for-hire operations, uncovering several groups operating globally. The investigative report showed the complex and sophisticated nature of such operations, which often involved multiple layers of hackers subcontracting work to maintain anonymity and evade legal repercussions.
The London-based National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said in a report published on June 22 2023 that it was increasingly seeing ""hackers-for-hire"" brought in ""to gain the upper hand in business dealings or legal disputes.""

Notable cases
Several high-profile hack-for-hire operations have made headlines in recent years:

Operation Aurora (2009): A cyber-attack which began in mid-2009 targeted several high-profile organizations, including Google and Adobe. Later investigations linked the attacks to the Chinese government, suggesting state-sponsored hack-for-hire activity.

Halle aux blés (Paris),"The Halle aux blés (Wheats Exchange or Grains Exchange) was a circular building in central Paris used by grain traders built in 1763–1767, with an open-air interior court that was capped by a wooden dome in 1783, then by an iron dome in 1811. In a major reconstruction in 1888–1889 much of the structure was replaced and the building became the Bourse de commerce.
The structure influenced the design of public buildings in Britain and the United States.

History
The city of Paris purchased the site of the former Hôtel de Soissons in 1755.
The hôtel had been demolished and its materials sold, but the Medici column was left standing.
On 23 November 1762 King Louis XV of France (1710–1774) declared that a hall of grain and flour (halle aux blés et farines) would be built on the site.
Construction of the hall began in 1763 following a design by Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières (1721–89), who supervised the work.
The circular hall surrounding a circular courtyard was completed in 1767.
Six roads radiated from the Rue Viarmes, which ran around the hall.
Work on a wooden dome to cover the courtyard began on 10 September 1782 and was completed on 31 January 1783.
The wooden dome was destroyed by fire in 1802.
An imperial decree of 4 September 1807 stated that the hall was to be covered by a dome with cast-iron vertical arches covered in tinned copper.
The replacement was complete in 1811.
The building, now made entirely of stone, brick, iron and copper, was considered fireproof.
In 1854 there was another fire in the building.
By the start of the Second French Empire (1852–70) the hall was no longer used to store flour.
It was too small to serve the needs of the two million inhabitants of Paris and had become a sort of bourse, or exchange for titles to grain from Beauce, Brie and Picardy, and flour from the mills of Seine-et-Marne and Seine-et-Oise.
The grain and flour was then delivered via rail direct from the provinces to the bakers and merchants.
Fortunes were made and lost through speculation, not always honestly.
The exchange was closed in 1873. In 1885 the building was assigned to the Commodities Exchange.

Structure
The building was circular, with an exterior diameter of 68.19 metres (223.7 ft), and enclosed a round court with a diameter of 19.5 metres (64 ft). 
The building was pierced by 28 arcades on the ground floor, and the same number of windows on the floor above. 
The upper floor was reached by a double stairway, so that those going up one stairway would not meet those going down the other.
Originally there was no roof over the central courtyard.
In 1782 François-Joseph Bélanger  (1744–1818) proposed to add an iron cupola to cover the courtyard, but his plan was rejected. 
Instead, from 1782 to 1783 a laminated wood dome was built to a design by Jacques-Guillaume Legrand (1753–1807) and Jacques Molinos (1743–1831) based on the principles defined by Philibert de l'Orme (c. 1514–1570).
The wooden dome was pierced by 25 large skylights.

Outline of social science,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to social science:
Social science – main branch of science comprising scientific fields concerned with societies, human behaviour, and social relationships.

Definition
Social science can be described as all of the following:

A  science – systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.
Major category of academic disciplines – an academic discipline is focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with academic areas of study or areas of professional practice. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines. For instance, gravitation is strongly associated with the discipline of physics, and is considered to be part of that disciplinary knowledge.

Branches of social science
Anthropology - the study of humans, past and present, that draws and builds upon knowledge from the social sciences and biological sciences, as well as the humanities and the natural sciences.
Anthropology of religion – the study of religious institutions about other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures
Applied anthropology – application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems.
Archaeology – the study of cultures via material remains and environmental data (Outline of archaeology)
Cultural anthropology – a branch of anthropology focused on the study of cultural variation among humans, collecting data about the effect of global economic and political processes on local cultural realities.
Ethnobiology – the scientific study of dynamic relationships between peoples, biota, and environments, from the distant past to the immediate present.
Ethnobotany – is the study of a region's plants and their practical uses through the traditional knowledge of local culture and people.
Ethnography – the systematic study of people and cultures.
Ethnology – a branch of anthropology that compares and analyzes the origins, distribution, technology, religion, language, and social structure of the ethnic, racial, and/or national divisions of humanity.
Ethnopoetics – method of recording text versions of oral poetry or narrative performances (i.e., verbal lore) that uses poetic lines, verses, and stanzas (instead of prose paragraphs) to capture the formal, poetic performance elements which would otherwise be lost in the written texts.
Evolutionary anthropology – an interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominids and non-hominid primates.
Experimental archaeology – Experimental archaeology employs several different methods, techniques, analyses, and approaches to generate and test hypothese",science
Local history,"Local history is the study of history in a geographically local context, often concentrating on a relatively small local community. It incorporates cultural and social aspects of history. Local history is not merely national history writ small but a study of past events in a given geographical area which is based on a wide variety of documentary evidence and placed in a comparative context that is both regional and national. Historic plaques are one form of documentation of significant occurrences in the past and oral histories are another.
Local history is often documented by local historical societies or groups that form to preserve a local historic building or other historic site. Many works of local history are compiled by amateur historians working independently or archivists employed by various organizations. An important aspect of local history is the publication and cataloguing of documents preserved in local or national records which relate to particular areas.
In a number of countries a broader concept of local lore is known, which is a comprehensive study of everything pertaining to a certain locality: history, ethnography, geography, natural history, etc.

Local contexts
Local history tends to be less documented than other types, with fewer books and artifacts than that of a country or continent. Many local histories are recorded as oral tales or stories and so are more vulnerable than more well known issues. Artifacts of local history are often collected in local history museums, which may be housed in a historic house or other building. Individual historic sites are inherently local, although they may have national or world history importance as well. Many however have little overall historical impact but add depth to the local area.

Australia
In Australia, local history is focussed on specific cities and suburbs or country towns and regions. In cities, local history might concentrate on a CBD and its bordering suburbs, on a specific suburb or municipality, or on an agglomeration of suburbs and municipalities (because local government boundaries have changed over time). Outside the larger cities, local history often examines regional towns and surrounding areas.
Records are typically stored at state libraries, public libraries, historical societies and public record offices. For example, the State Library of Victoria holds extensive local history records for Melbourne and other places in Victoria. Many other Melbourne libraries have local history collections, along with the Public Record Office Victoria and the Royal Historical Society of Victoria. In New South Wales, the Royal Australian Historical Society has studied local history as part of its remit since its founding in 1901. It holds local history records along with the State Library of NSW and other state and local libraries and archives.
Historians have examined the ways local history has been written in Australia since the nineteenth century. Early on, the emphasis was on ",history
Polocrosse,"Polocrosse is a team sport that is a combination of polo and lacrosse. It is played outside, on a field (the pitch), on horseback. Each rider uses a cane or fiberglass stick to which is attached a racquet head with a loose, thread net, in which the ball is carried. The ball is made of sponge rubber and is approximately four inches across. The objective is to score goals by throwing the ball between the opposing team's goal posts.

Rules
Unlike polo, players are allowed only to play one horse, except in the case of injury. There is no restriction on the horse's height, although polocrosse horses are generally smaller than 16hh. Horses of all breeds play polocrosse and the Australian Stock Horse is the most popular breed playing in Australia. Stallions are not permitted to play.
A team consists of six players, divided into two sections of three who each play either 2, 3 or 4 chukkas of six to eight minutes, depending on the rules of the tournament, with the two sections from each team alternating on and off the field each chukka. A match comprises four, six or eight chukkas. The three players in each section play the position of a No. 1, attack, a No. 2, midfield (a combination of defence and offence), or a No. 3, defence.
The team structure was designed to force players to pass the ball about amongst themselves, making it a better skilled, faster sport.
The field is 60 by 160 yards (55 m × 146 m), with three separate areas. The goal scoring areas, on each end, are 30 yards long. Only the No. 1 of the attacking team and the No. 3 of the defending team can play in these areas.
The middle area is 100 yards long. The line separating the goal scoring and centre areas is called the penalty or thirty-yard line. Goal posts are eight feet apart. To score, the ball must be thrown from outside an 11-yard semicircle in front of the goal.
Players can pick up the ball from the ground, catch it in their racquet, and ride with it. They throw it to other players until the No.1 has possessi",sports
Cuju,"Cuju or Ts'u-chü (Chinese: 蹴鞠; pinyin: cù jū) is an ancient Chinese football game, that resembles a mix of basketball, association football and volleyball. FIFA cites cuju as the earliest form of a kicking game for which there is documentary evidence, a military manual from the Han dynasty. 

It is a competitive game that involves both teams trying to kick a ball through an opening into a central hoop without the use of hands whilst ensuring the ball does not touch the ground. This is similar to how hackey-sack is played today. Descriptions of the game date back to the Han dynasty, with a Chinese military work from the 3rd–2nd century BC describing it as an exercise. It was also played in other Asian countries like Korea, Japan and Vietnam.

History
The first mention of cuju in a historical text is in the Warring States era Zhan Guo Ce, in the section describing the state of Qi. It is also described in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian (under the Biography of Su Qin), written during the Han dynasty. A competitive form of cuju was used as fitness training for military cavaliers, while other forms were played for entertainment in wealthy cities like Linzi.
During the Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220), the popularity of cuju spread from the army to the royal courts and upper classes. It is said that the Han emperor Wu Di enjoyed the sport. At the same time, cuju games were standardized and rules were established. Cuju matches were often held inside the imperial palace. A type of court called ju chang (鞠場) was built especially for cuju matches, which had six crescent-shaped goal posts at each end.
The sport was improved during the Tang dynasty (618–907). First of all, the feather-stuffed ball was replaced by an air-filled ball with a two-layered hull. Also, two different types of goal posts emerged: One was made by setting up posts with a net between them and the other consisted of just one goal post in the middle of the field. The Tang dynasty capital of Chang'an was filled with cuju fields, in the backyards of large mansions, and some were even established in the grounds of the palaces. Soldiers who belonged to the imperial army and Gold Bird Guard often formed cuju teams for the delight of the emperor and his court. The level of female cuju teams also improved. Cuju even became popular amongst the scholars and intellectuals, and if a courtier lacked skill in the game, he could pardon himself by acting as a scorekeeper.
Cuju flourished during the Song dynasty (960–1279) due to social and economic development, extending its popularity to every class in society. At that time, professional cuju players were popular, and the sport began to take on a commercial edge. Professional cuju players fell into two groups: One was trained by and performed for the royal court (unearthed copper mirrors and brush pots from the Song often depict professional performances) and the other consisted of civilians who made a living as cuju players.

History of Sialkot,"History of Sialkot (Punjabi: سیالکوٹ دی تریخ; Urdu: تاريخ سیالکوٹ), the capital of Sialkot District, is a city situated in the north-east of the Punjab province in Pakistan at the feet of the snow-covered peaks of Kashmir near the Chenab river. The city is about 125 km (78 mi) north-west of Lahore and only a few kilometres from Jammu in India.

Founding
Sialkot is likely the capital of the Madra Kingdom Sagala, Sakala (Sanskrit: साकला), or Sangala (Ancient Greek: Σάγγαλα) mentioned in the Mahabharata, a Sanskrit epic of ancient India, as occupying a similar area as Greek accounts of Sagala. The city may have been inhabited by the Saka, or Scythians, from Central Asia who had migrated into the Subcontinent. The region was noted in the Mahabharata for the ""loose and Bacchanalian"" women who lived in the woods there. The city was said to have been located in the Sakaladvipa region between the Chenab and Ravi rivers, now known as the Rechna Doab.

Greek
The Anabasis of Alexander, written by the Roman-Greek historian Arrian, recorded that Alexander the Great captured ancient Sialkot, recorded as Sagala, from the Cathaeans, who had entrenched themselves there. The city had been home to 80,000 residents on the eve of Alexander's invasion, but was razed as a warning against any other nearby cities that might resist his invasion.

Indo-Greek
The ancient city was rebuilt, and made capital by the Indo-Greek king Menander I of the Euthydemid dynasty, in the 2nd century BCE. The rebuilt city was shifted slightly from the older city, as rebuilding on exactly the same spot was considered inauspicious.
Under Menander's rule, the city greatly prospered as a major trading centre renowned for its silk. Menander embraced Buddhism in Sagala, after an extensive debating with the Buddhist monk Nagasena, as recorded in the Buddhist text Milinda Panha. the text offers an early description of the city's cityscape and status as a prosperous trade centre with numerous green spaces. Following his conversion, Sialkot developed as a major centre for Buddhist thought.
Ancient Sialkot was recorded by Ptolemy in his 1st century CE work, Geography, in which he refers to the city as Euthymedia (Εύθυμέδεια).

Alchon Huns
Around 460 CE, the Alchon Huns invaded the region from Central Asia, forcing the ruling family of nearby Taxila to seek refuge in Sialkot. Sialkot itself was soon captured, and the city was made capital of the Alchon Huns around 515, during the reign of Toramana. During the reign of his son, Mihirakula, the empire reached its zenith. The Alchon Huns were defeated in 528 by a coalition of princes led by Prince Yashodharman

Late antiquity
The city was visited by the Chinese traveller Xuanzang in 633, who recorded the city's name as She-kie-lo. Xuanzang reported that the city had been rebuilt approximately 15 li, or 2.5 miles, away from the city ruined by Alexander the Great. During this time, Sialkot served as the political nucleus of the Punjab region. The city was t",history
A History of Medicine,"A History of Medicine is a book by Scottish surgeon Douglas Guthrie that was published in 1945 by Thomas Nelson and Sons. It came to wide attention after it was reviewed by the playwright George Bernard Shaw and marked the beginning for Guthrie of a new career in teaching the history of medicine.

Aim
Guthrie's objective was to bring to a wide audience and in chronological order, the past achievements in the history of medicine, from Imhotep to William Osler.

Contents
The first edition of the book consisted of 20 chapters, 448 pages and 72 plates, beginning with ""The Genesis of Medicine"" and ending with a chapter focussed on medical journalism.
In the preface, Guthrie paid tribute to his mentor, the Scottish physician John Comrie, who had introduced him to the subject of medical history, Alexander Miles who ""read the original manuscript and supplied much helpful criticism in the early stages of the work"", the librarian of the Royal Society of Medicine G. F. Home and to J. C. Corson from Edinburgh University Library who prepared the index.

Publication
After 10 years' research, the book was published in 1945, the same year that Guthrie retired from clinical work. It was published in Britain by Thomas Nelson and Sons, and later in an American edition. Translations followed in Spanish (1947), German (1952) and Italian (1966).

Reception
The book received at least 53 English-language reviews which Guthrie kept in a scrapbook which was passed to his friend Haldane Philp Tait and is now (2019) in the collections of the Lothian Health Service Archive.
Nearly all of the reviews were positive and the book was favourably compared with the few contemporary general histories of medicine then available, particularly Charles Singer's A Short History of Medicine and Garrison's An introduction to the History of Medicine.
The British Medical Journal and The Lancet gave favourable reviews and the Journal of the American Medical Association recommended it to all physicians, but the Bulletin of the History of Medicine responded more critically, identifying a number of inaccurate names and dates. This intense criticism came from George Rosen, who was of the opinion that Guthrie should have included social context. Guthrie's response, as documented in his scrapbook, described it as ""the only really adverse criticism, obviously by a disgruntled reviewer who thinks he could have done better himself"".
The book came to wider attention following a 3,000-word review by George Bernard Shaw in The Observer. Shaw wrote, ""I am floored by the extraordinary discrepancy between his [Guthrie's] knowledge and my knowledge ... Dr Guthrie's job of packing it [the history of medicine] into 400 pages is learnedly and readably done"". Shaw did criticise Guthrie for his omission of practitioners of alternative medicine including osteopaths, herbalists and homoeopaths, which Shaw believed was because ""Dr Guthrie either does not know about them or considers them beneath the dignity of a his",medicine

Age of Discovery
Also called the Age of Exploration.
The time period between approximately the late 15th century and the 17th century during which seafarers from various European polities traveled to, explored, and charted regions across the globe which had previously been unknown or unfamiliar to Europeans and, more broadly, during which previously isolated human populations became socially, politically, and/or economically aware of and connected to each other. These explorations, often commissioned and funded by state governments, were spurred by advances in cartography and maritime technology at the beginning of the early modern period, especially the introduction of sailing vessels capable of enduring extremely long trans-oceanic voyages, and so the Age of Discovery largely overlaps with the Age of Sail. The period is also associated with the emergence of colonialism and imperialism as practiced by European monarchies, particularly the colonization of the Americas and the establishment of oceanic trade routes to India and Southeast Asia, which are sometimes identified with the origins of the global economy and of globalization, as well as the exchange, intentional and unintentional, of plants, animals, diseases, technologies, and ideas between previously isolated parts of the world.

Lakshmi Tatma,"Lakshmi Tatma is an Indian girl born in 2005 in a village in Araria district, Bihar, with four arms and four legs. She was actually one of a pair of ischiopagus conjoined twins, one of which was headless because its head had atrophied and chest had not fully developed in the womb, causing the appearance of one child with four arms and four legs. She has undergone surgery to remove these extra limbs.

Background
Lakshmi's father, Shambhu, and mother, Poonam, were day labourers who earned less than 40 rupees per day and were unable to afford a separation surgery for their daughter. The daughter was named after Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth (who is depicted as four-armed). The girl was sometimes an object of worship as an incarnation of the goddess; by the age of two, she was known all over India. At one point, a circus offered the couple money to buy Lakshmi as a sideshow, which forced the family into hiding. At the time of being found by Sharan Patil, she had an infected pressure ulcer at the neck end of the parasitic twin and continuous fevers.

Surgery
Lakshmi was the subject of a surgery carried out by Sharan Patil and 30 other physicians which included Chief anaesthetist Yohannan John at Sparsh Hospital in Bangalore, Karnataka.
The twins' two pelvises formed a single combined ring. Each twin had one working kidney. Lakshmi had a second kidney which was necrotic. The autosite's (Lakshmi herself) feet were affected by clubfoot.
Her abdominal aorta gave off iliac branches to the autosite's legs and continued as a main trunk artery which gave off iliac branches to the parasite's legs and continued, and finally forked into the parasite's subclavian arteries.
The parasitic twin's spine and abdomen merged with Lakshmi's body. The twins' backbones were joined end-to-end and nerves were entangled. Lakshmi could not crawl normally or walk, but she could drag herself around somewhat. Doctors surmised early on that without the operation, she would not be able to live into her teens. The surgery began on Tuesday, 6 November 2007, at 7:00 a.m. IST (01:30 UTC), and was planned to last 40 hours at the most. An estimated cost of over $625,000 American dollars was paid entirely by the hospital's charitable wing, the Sparsh Foundation. A team of more than 30 surgeons worked in shifts. The surgery lasted for 27 hours, and doctors gave Lakshmi a 75–80% chance of survival during the surgery.
The steps of the operation were:

(8 hours): Abdominal operation: remove the parasite's abdominal organs.
Remove the autosite's necrotic kidney and replace it with the parasite's kidney. Tie off the blood vessels that supplied the parasite.
Move the reproductive system and the urinary bladder into the autosite.
(6 to 8 hours) Amputate the parasite's legs at the hip joints: this caused heavy bleeding. Cut the joined backbone: the nerves around the joint were found to be extremely chaotic, and care had to be taken to avoid causing paralysis.

Beach Flags (sport),"Beach Flags is a sporting event used by Surf lifesavers to practice beach sprinting and reflexes.
The game is played by sticking a series of flags (typically short lengths of hosepipe) into the sand in a row. The competitors lie facing away (and face down) approximately 20 metres away. Upon a starting signal, the competitors race to the flags and try to grab one. The difficulty in the sport is that there are always fewer flags than there are competitors. The competitors who do not manage to capture a flag are eliminated, the flags are reset (removing one more), and the game continues until there is one person remaining - the winner. The game progresses in much the same way as musical chairs.  Competitors are also eliminated if they commit a starting infringement by moving between the ""heads down heads up"" and starting signal usually a horn or just someone yelling go. British team member and beach sprint specialist Jo Devine calls the sport “great fun for all” 
The event involves a tactical component as competitors have discretion as to which flag they obtain.  While there is a degree of jostling, a competitor can be disqualified for deliberately impeding another competitor. 
Rather than testing endurance and stamina, the event tests power and reflexes.  A round run by Open Australian national finalists will take approximately 3.7 seconds.

Technology,"Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals, especially in a reproducible way. The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts, including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.
Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistory, followed by the control of fire—which in turn contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age, according to the cooking hypothesis. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.
While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion, and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation. As a result, philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing.

Etymology
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' (from Greek Τεχνολογία, from the Greek: τέχνη, romanized: tékhnē, lit. 'craft, art' and -λογία (-logíā), 'study, knowledge'). It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη (tékhnē), used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things', which encompassed activities like architecture.
Starting in the 19th century, continental Europeans started using the terms Technik (German) or technique (French) to refer to a 'way of doing', which included all technical arts, such as dancing, navigation, or printing, whether or not they required tools or instruments. At the time, Technologie (German and French) referred either to the academic discipline studying the ""methods of arts and crafts"", or to the political discipline ""intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts."" The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English, and so both were translated as technology. The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the 20th century, as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution, technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends.

Golden Age of Piracy,"The Golden Age of Piracy is a common designation for the period between the 1650s and the 1730s, when maritime piracy was a significant factor in the histories of the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
Histories of piracy often subdivide the Golden Age of Piracy into three periods:

The buccaneering period (approximately 1650 to 1680), characterized by Anglo-French seamen based in Jamaica, Martinica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies, and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific to western Pacific.
The Pirate Round (1690s), associated with long-distance voyages from the Americas to rob  East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea.
The post-Spanish Succession period (1715 to 1726), when English sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the North American eastern seaboard, and the West African coast.
Narrower definitions of the Golden Age sometimes exclude the first or second periods, but most include at least some portion of the third. The modern conception of pirates as depicted in popular culture is derived largely, although not always accurately, from the Golden Age of Piracy.
Factors contributing to piracy during the Golden Age included the rise in quantities of valuable cargoes being shipped to Europe over vast ocean areas, reduced European navies in certain regions, the training and experience that many sailors had gained in European navies (particularly the British Royal Navy), and corrupt and ineffective government in European overseas colonies. Colonial powers at the time constantly fought with pirates and engaged in several notable battles and other related events.

Name of the Golden Age
Origin
The oldest known literary mention of a ""Golden Age"" of piracy is from 1894, when the English journalist George Powell wrote about ""What appears to have been the golden age of piracy up to the last decade of the 17th century.""  Powell uses the phrase while reviewing Charles Leslie's A New and Exact History of Jamaica, then over 150 years old. Powell uses the phrase only once.
In 1897, a more systematic use of the phrase ""Golden Age of Piracy"" was introduced by historian John Fiske, who wrote, ""At no other time in the world's history has the business of piracy thriven so greatly as in the seventeenth century and the first part of the eighteenth. Its golden age may be said to have extended from about 1650 to about 1720.""  Fiske included the activities of the Barbary corsairs and East Asian pirates in this ""Golden Age,"" noting that ""as these Mussulman pirates and those of Eastern Asia were as busily at work in the seventeenth century as at any other time, their case does not impair my statement that the age of the buccaneers was the Golden Age of piracy.""
Pirate historians of the first half of the 20th century occasionally adopted Fiske's term ""Golden Age,"" without necessarily following his beginning and ending dates for i",history
Chaza,"The Chaza, or pelota nacional (national ball), is a South American racquet sport, (like tennis), which is practiced on a rectangular area bounded by lines. This area is divided by a line drawn on the floor that divides the playing field. It is played between two teams, each with 4 players. The object of the game is to launch a ball (called ""bombo"") by hand or racquet so that it bounces into the opponent's field without being returned.
The sport is widely practiced in Nariño, Colombia, and it's the national sport of Ecuador.

History
Chaza was created in the 14th century by indigenous communities who inhabited the area that is currently on the border of Colombia and Ecuador. In the beginning it was played with a heavy leather ball, which was thrown by hand.

Game Rules
This game can be played with hands or with a wooden racquet, The ball is lined with goatskin and called a ""bombo"" weighing 70-90 grams. 
As in volleyball, players rotate, which is why the field has a line (6 on each side) indicating which position each should play.
Points are scored as for tennis, i.e., 15, 30, 40 and the point. When a team gets 6 points and maintains a minimum difference of 2 points over their rival, it wins the set. When a team wins 2 sets, it wins the game.
Each point is also scored as in tennis, looking for the opposing team to fail to return the ball before it bounces 2 times within their field.
The field is rectangular and concrete and 110 meters long and 10 meters wide, divided by a line drawn on the ground.

5GBioShield,"The Bauer 5GBioShield, usually shortened to 5GBioShield, is a fraudulent device which was claimed to protect against radiation from 5G mobile networks. The device was invented by clinical pharmacist Jacques Bauer and former scientist Ilija Lakicevic and marketed by alternative medicine activist Sacha Stone. The product, which was sold for approximately £330 through an affiliate marketing scheme, was found to be composed of a normal USB thumb drive and a sticker. As of April 26, 2022, The official website is no longer online. British Trading Standards officials determined that the device was a scam.

Description
The manufacturers claim that: ""Through a process of quantum oscillation the 5G BioShield USB Key balances and reharmonizes the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wifi, tablets, etc.""
The device is simply a common USB thumb drive containing marketing documents and usage instructions. The USB device is housed in a clear perspex block imprinted with a stylized version of St George slaying a dragon, as based on a medal originally made by William Wyon for Albert, Prince Consort.
Lakicevic, the co-inventor of the product, describes the device as containing a ""new energy"" embedded in a sticker, and that the USB stick is merely a carrier and need not be powered on to work. Lakicevic's claims regarding this product were published in an issue of the International Journal of Science and Research (ITNJ), a pay-to-publish science journal with no peer review processes in place.

Reception
The device was recommended in a report published by Glastonbury Town Council. Town councillor Toby R. Hall stated that the device could be ""helpful"" and ""provide protection""  due to a ""wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser"".
An analysis by Pen Test Partners, however, concluded that this device was nothing more than a 128 megabyte capacity generic USB thumb drive. The security firm concluded that the device ""should [not] be promoted by publicly-funded bodies"".
Following this report, the device was investigated by Trading Standards and found to be a scam and the matter had been referred to City of London Police Fraud Squad.

Open-field system,"The open-field system was the prevalent agricultural system in much of Europe during the Middle Ages and lasted into the 20th century in Russia, Iran, and Turkey. Each manor or village had two or three large fields, usually several hundred acres each, which were divided into many narrow strips of land. The strips or selions were cultivated by peasants, often called tenants or serfs. The holdings of a manor also included woodland and pasture areas for common usage and fields belonging to the lord of the manor and the religious authorities, usually Roman Catholics in medieval Western Europe. The farmers customarily lived in separate houses in a nucleated village with a much larger manor house and church nearby. The open-field system necessitated co-operation among the residents of the manor.
The Lord of the Manor, his officials, and a manorial court administered the manor and exercised jurisdiction over the peasantry. The Lord levied rents and required the peasantry to work on his personal lands, called a demesne.
In medieval times, little land was owned outright. Instead, generally the lord had rights given to him by the king, and the tenant rented land from the lord. Lords demanded rents and labour from the tenants, but the tenants had firm user rights to cropland and common land and those rights were passed down from generation to generation. A medieval lord could not evict a tenant nor hire labour to replace him without legal cause. Most tenants likewise were not free without penalty to depart the manor for other locations or occupations. The rise of capitalism and the concept of land as a commodity to be bought and sold led to the gradual demise of the open-field system. The open-field system was gradually replaced over several centuries by private ownership of land, especially after the 15th century in the process known as enclosure in England. France, Germany, and other northern European countries had systems similar to England, although open fields generally endured longer on the continent. 
Some elements of the open-field system were practised by early settlers in the New England region of the United States.

Description
The most visible characteristic of the open-field system was that the arable land belonging to a manor was divided into many long narrow furlongs for cultivation. The fields of cultivated land were unfenced, hence the name open-field system. Each tenant of the manor cultivated several strips of land scattered around the manor.
The village of Elton, Cambridgeshire, is representative of a medieval open-field manor in England. The manor, whose Lord was an abbot from a nearby monastery, had 13 ""hides"" of arable land of six virgates each. The acreage of a hide and virgate varied; but at Elton, a hide was 144 acres (58 ha) and a virgate was 24 acres (10 ha). Thus, the total of arable land amounted to 1,872 acres (758 ha). The abbot's demesne land consisted of three hides plus 16 acres (6.5 ha) of meadow and 3 acres (1 ha) of pas",economics

Hokutoryu Ju-Jutsu,"Hokutoryu Ju-Jutsu is a Finnish style of the Japanese martial art jujutsu developed in 1977 by Auvo Niiniketo. The name of the style is Japanese and literally translates as Big Dipper-style, though is more commonly translated as North Star-style. The style uses a Japanese name to show respect to the country of origin of jujutsu. Practitioners of the style can be recognized by the logo of the style on their jujutsugi, a red inversed triangle.
The style does not rely on physical strength and instead relies on speed, timing and ""martial eye"". The techniques of the style contain punches, kicks, throws, takedowns, jointlocks, chokes, pins, breakfalls, clinch fighting, ground fighting and weapon techniques. The style also features sparring and training against both armed and unarmed opponents as an important part of the style. Style seeks to keep the principles of the traditional Japanese martial art while making it more compatible with western culture.
The style works for both men and women. Roughly 40% of its practitioners are female. Niiniketo notes that women are often more technically proficient, where as men can easily fall back to relying on brute force.
There are roughly 50 Hokutoryu schools around the world and the style has spread to several countries, including but not limited to: Russia, Belarus, Estonia, Iran, Ecuador, United States, Sweden and Norway. Most of the schools however are located in Finland.

Auvo Niiniketo
Sōke Auvo Niiniketo (born 1954) (10th dan), ""Father of Finnish Ju-Jutsu"" has been training martial arts for most of his life, starting with boxing at the age of eight and winning the national youth championship in 1972 at 75 kg and winning bronze in national championship in 1974. Niiniketo was introduced to jujutsu in Stockholm, Sweden, during a boxing trip, which immediately appealed to him, seeing it as a complete martial art. After retiring from boxing, he started practicing karate, finding its kicks to be particularly effective. Though he enjoyed kihon, it was kumite that appealed to him the most.
Niiniketo later decided to start training jujutsu. Niiniketo received his first jujutsu belt ranks up to blue belt in Sweden, as Finland did not have a jujutsu dojo at the time. In 1977, he started the first jujutsu courses in Helsinki and soon after this he opened the first jujutsu dojo in Finland in the city. This was the founding of Hokutoryu.
In 1978, Niiniketo met English senseis Richard Morris and Robert Clark from World Ju-Jitsu Federation and co-operates with them to this day. This co-operation initially led to Hokutoryu losing all of its belt ranks when switching to a new system but Hokutoryu made quick progress in the new system. In 1979, Niiniketo received his jujutsu black belt from Morris and Clark.
During his time in Sweden, Niiniketo continued to cross-train in karate, ultimately winning the Finnish national heavyweight championship in 1979.
In 1980, Niiniketo brought kickboxing to Finland and started building a ",sports
Applied economics,"Applied economics is the application of economic theory and econometrics in specific settings. As one of the two sets of fields of economics (the other set being the core), it is typically characterized by the application of the core, i.e. economic theory and econometrics to address practical issues in a range of fields including  demographic economics, labour economics, business economics, industrial organization, agricultural economics, development economics, education economics, engineering economics, financial economics, health economics, monetary economics, public economics, and economic history. From the perspective of economic development, the purpose of applied economics is to enhance the quality of business practices and national policy making.
The process often involves a reduction in the level of abstraction of this core theory. There are a variety of approaches including not only empirical estimation using econometrics, input-output analysis or simulations but also case studies, historical analogy and so-called common sense or the ""vernacular"".  This range of approaches is indicative of what Roger Backhouse and Jeff Biddle argue is the ambiguous nature of the concept of applied economics. It is a concept with multiple meanings. Among broad methodological distinctions, one source places it in neither positive nor normative economics but the art of economics, glossed as ""what most economists do"".

Origins of the term
The origin and meanings of applied economics have a long history going back to the writing of Say and Mill. Say wrote about ""applying"" the ""general principles of political economy"" to ""ascertain the rule of action of any combination of circumstances presented to us"". The full title of Mill's (1848) work is Principles of Political Economy with Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy.

J.N. Keynes discussion
John Neville Keynes was perhaps the first to use the phrase ""applied economics"". He noted that the ""English School"" (John Stuart Mill, John Elliott Cairnes, and Nassau William Senior) believed that political economy was a positive, abstract, deductive science; and that this school made a clear distinction  ""between political economy itself and its applications to practice"" (1917, 12). This school thought that a general body of theory could be established through abstract reasoning – not relying on a wide knowledge of economic facts. From this point of view applying this theory involved making allowances for some of the factors ignored in building the abstract theories.  Keynes wrote about applying the political economies hypothetical laws to interpreting and explaining of ""concrete industrial facts"". The issue of conceptual distinction between political economy as a science (involving formulating laws which govern  the production and distribution of wealth) and political economy as an art (using the laws to tackle practical problems).

Australian rodeo,"Rodeos have long been a popular competitor and spectator sport in Australia, but were not run on an organised basis until the 1880s.

History
The term buck-jumping, as a regular activity involving horses, was in use in Australia by 1855. Newspaper reports recorded public roughriding events that took place in Victoria during the 1880s. These events included competitions for roughriding and bullock-throwing which was accomplished by riding up to bullock, grabbing its tail and throwing it off balance and then tying its legs. This competition arose from the stockman's skill in capturing feral or wild cattle.
The National Agricultural Society of Victoria ran one of the earliest recorded events in 1888, when a roughriding competition was held at their annual show.
During the 1890s there were many Australian and some international Wild West shows travelling the country. Wirth's Wild West Show travelled Australia until the banks' crash in 1893. They then toured England, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America.
Proprietors such as Thorpe McConville, plus the outstanding buckjump riders; Lance Skuthorpe, Australian Indigenous roughrider Billy Waite, the Gill family, Bibby Bros and Colin McLeod ran travelling roughriding shows. These shows increased the popularity of roughriding throughout much of Australia. In 1908 the Australian Buckjumpers Limited were formed and featured celebrated roughriders including Waite, Jack Dempster, Fred Morton and Cecil Miller. The travelling rodeos provided displays of riding bucking horses and bullocks, whipcracking, performing dogs and ponies and rope-spinning. By 1930 the Great Depression left only a few of these travelling shows on the road.
The equipment used by early roughriders consisted of a poley saddle or exercise pad, without stirrups or a crupper and a chest rein that ran from the girth to the rider's hand, leaving him without any control of the buckjumper's head. Bullock and bareback riders were still permitted to use two hands at this stage.
During 1927 a rodeo organised in Adelaide, South Australia attracted an estimated 50,000 spectators. Melbourne staged a Wild West Show in 1934 which hired top Australian riders as well as a number of visiting cowboys. Following the success of the rodeo events at the Melbourne show the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales (NSW) planned an international rodeo for its 1935 Sydney Royal Easter Show and continued to invite international cowboys to its show.
Bushmen's Carnivals, the Australian equivalents of American rodeos, originated in Northern New South Wales in the 1920s and were well established by the 1930s. In 1930 Warwick, Queensland added the American-style contests of clowns, ropers and trick riders to its programme to promote more public interest. These carnivals were sports days that held the main event of campdrafting, plus buckjumping, bullock (or steer) riding and bullock throwing. During World War II many Queensland towns such as Char",sports
Buffer zone,"A buffer zone, also historically known as a march, is a neutral area that lies between two or more bodies of land; usually, between countries. Depending on the type of buffer zone, it may serve to separate regions or conjoin them.
Common types of buffer zones are demilitarized zones, border zones and certain restrictive easement zones and green belts. Such zones may be comprised by a sovereign state, forming a buffer state.
Buffer zones have various purposes, politically or otherwise. They can be set up for a multitude of reasons, such as to prevent violence, protect the environment, shield residential and commercial zones from industrial accidents or natural disasters, or even isolate prisons. Buffer zones often result in large uninhabited regions that are themselves noteworthy in many increasingly developed or crowded parts of the world that unintentionally create a de facto wildlife sanctuary.

Conservation
For use in nature conservation, a buffer zone is often created to enhance the protection of areas under management for their biodiversity importance. The buffer zone of a protected area may be situated around the periphery of the region or may be a connecting zone within it that links two or more protected areas, therefore increasing their dynamics and conservation productivity. A buffer zone can also be one of the protected area categories (e.g. category V or VI of IUCN Protected Area) or a classification scheme (e.g. NATURA 2000) depending on the conservation objective. The term 'buffer zone' initially gained prominence in the conservation of natural and cultural heritage through its usage in the establishment of UNESCO's World Heritage Convention, and the term was intended to be used as follows:

A buffer zone serves to provide an additional layer of protection to a World Heritage property. The concept of a buffer zone was first included in the Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention in 1977. In the most current version of the Operational Guidelines of 2005 the inclusion of a buffer zone into a nomination of a site to the World Heritage List is strongly recommended but not mandatory.
—World Heritage Convention
The buffer zone is one of the Best Management Practices (BMPs). A buffer zone is intended to avert the effect of negative environmental or human influences, whether or not it embodies natural or cultural value itself. The importance and function of a buffer zone and the necessary protective measures derived thereof is a relatively new concept in conservation science and can differ greatly for each site.

Ecological functions of conservation
Water quality improvement
The quality of surface water in many countries is getting worse due to the misuse of land. Although the buffer zone occupies a small area, it greatly improves the quality of water in the agricultural watershed due to its filtering effect on nutrients in the underground water and surface water.

Divide and rule,"Divide and rule, more frequently called Divide and conquer (Latin: divide et impera, lit. 'divide and rule'), in politics refers to an entity gaining and maintaining political power by using divisive measures. This includes the exploitation of existing divisions within a political group by its political opponents, and also the deliberate creation or strengthening of such divisions.

Definition
The phrase divide and conquer (from the latin divide et impera) first appeared in English around 1600.
The strategy of division and rule has been attributed to sovereigns, ranging from Louis XI of France to the House of Habsburg. Edward Coke denounces it in Chapter I of the Fourth Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England, reporting that when it was demanded by the Lords and Commons what might be a principal motive for them to have good success in Parliament, it was answered: ""Eritis insuperabiles, si fueritis inseparabiles. Explosum est illud diverbium: Divide, & impera, cum radix & vertex imperii in obedientium consensu rata sunt."" (""You would be invincible if you were inseparable. This proverb, Divide and rule, has been rejected, since the root and the summit of authority are confirmed by the consent of the subjects."")
In a minor variation, Sir Francis Bacon wrote the phrase as separa et impera in a letter to James I of 15 February 1615. James Madison made this recommendation in a letter to Thomas Jefferson of 24 October 1787, which summarized the thesis of Federalist No. 10: ""Divide et impera, the reprobated axiom of tyranny, is under certain (some) qualifications, the only policy, by which a republic can be administered on just principles.""
Divide et impera is the third of three political maxims in Immanuel Kant's Perpetual Peace (1795), Appendix I, the others being Fac et excusa (""Act now, and make excuses later"") and Si fecisti, nega (""If you commit a crime, deny it""):  Kant refers this tactic when describing the traits of a ""political moralist.""

Politics
In politics, the concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures, and especially prevents smaller power groups from linking up, causing rivalries and fomenting discord among the people to prevent a rebellion against the elites or the people implementing the strategy. The goal is either to pit the lower classes against themselves to prevent a revolution, or to provide a desired solution to the growing discord that strengthens the power of the elites.
The principle ""divide et impera"" is cited as a common in politics by Traiano Boccalini in La bilancia politica.

Economics
In economics, the concept is also mentioned as a strategy for market segmentation to get the most out of the players in a competitive market.

Social work,"Social work is an academic discipline and practice-based profession concerned with meeting the basic needs of individuals, families, groups, communities, and society as a whole to enhance their individual and collective well-being. Social work practice draws from liberal arts, social science, and interdisciplinary areas such as psychology, sociology, health, political science, community development, law, and economics to engage with systems and policies, conduct assessments, develop interventions, and enhance social functioning and responsibility. The ultimate goals of social work include the improvement of people's lives, alleviation of biopsychosocial concerns, empowerment of individuals and communities, and the achievement of social justice.
Social work practice is often divided into three levels. Micro-work involves working directly with individuals and families, such as providing individual counseling/therapy or assisting a family in accessing services. Mezzo-work involves working with groups and communities, such as conducting group therapy or providing services for community agencies. Macro-work involves fostering change on a larger scale through advocacy, social policy, research development, non-profit and public service administration, or working with government agencies. Starting in the 1960s, a few universities began social work management programmes, to prepare students for the management of social and human service organizations, in addition to classical social work education.
The social work profession developed in the 19th century, with some of its roots in voluntary philanthropy and in grassroots organizing. However, responses to social needs had existed long before then, primarily from public almshouses, private charities and religious organizations. The effects of the Industrial Revolution and of the Great Depression of the 1930s placed pressure on social work to become a more defined discipline as social workers responded to the child welfare concerns related to widespread poverty and reliance on child labor in industrial settings.

Definition
Social work is a broad profession that intersects with several disciplines. Social work organizations offer the following definitions:

Social work is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility and respect for diversities are central to social work. Underpinned by theories of social work, social sciences, humanities, and indigenous knowledge, social work engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance well-being.

Administrative history,"Administrative history is a historiographic field which looks at the history of state administrations and bureaucracies. Originally considered a sub-field of Administrative Sciences that was intended to improve contemporary governance, administrative history has become an increasingly separate field. Administrative historians study the changes in administrative ideologies and administrative law while also looking at civil servants and the relationship between government and society. It is related to political and constitutional history. The discipline is most common in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. In 1965, when fields like social history were becoming ever more popular, G. R. Elton (then a fellow of Clare College, Cambridge) defended administrative history as the only field which can explain how the machinery of government actually worked in the past.

The New Administrative History
Historians researching the medieval and early modern periods have begun to reexplore the possibilities of administrative history. This movement has been described as the ""New Administrative History"". It embraces a broad range of approaches, including interdisciplinary and theoretical work – as exemplified by John Sabapathy – and also more traditional institutional approaches, revisiting the methods of influential administrative historians such as T. F. Tout and G. R. Elton.

Crokinole,"Crokinole (  KROH-ki-nohl) is a disk-flicking dexterity board game, possibly of Canadian origin, similar to the games of pitchnut, carrom, and pichenotte, with elements of shuffleboard and curling reduced to table-top size. Players take turns shooting discs across the circular playing surface, trying to land their discs in the higher-scoring regions of the board, particularly the recessed centre hole of 20 points, while also attempting to knock opposing discs off the board, and into the 'ditch'. In crokinole, the shooting is generally towards the centre of the board, unlike carroms and pitchnut, where the shooting is towards the four outer corner pockets, as in pool. Crokinole is also played using cue sticks, and there is a special category for cue stick participants at the World Crokinole Championships in Tavistock, Ontario, Canada.

Equipment
Board dimensions vary with a playing surface typically of polished wood or laminate approximately 26 inches (660 mm) in diameter. The arrangement is 3 concentric rings worth 5, 10, and 15 points as you move in from the outside. There is a shallow 20-point hole at the centre. The inner 15-point ring is guarded with 8 small bumpers or posts. The outer ring of the board is divided into four quadrants. The outer edge of the board is raised slightly to keep errant shots from flying out, with a gutter between the playing surface and the edge to collect discarded pieces. Crokinole boards are typically octagonal or round in shape. The wooden discs are roughly checker-sized, slightly smaller in diameter than the board's central hole, and typically have one side slightly concave and one side slightly convex, mainly due to the inherent features of wood, more than a planned design. Alternatively, the game may be played with ring-shaped pieces with a central hole.

Powder
The use of any lubricating powder in crokinole is controversial, with some purists reviling the practice.
Powder is sometimes used to ensure pieces slide smoothly on the surface. Boric acid was popular for a long time, but is now considered toxic and has been replaced with safer substitutes. The EU has classified Boric acid as a ""Serious Health Hazard"". In the UK, many players use a version of anti-set-off spray powder, from the printing industry, which has specific electrostatic properties, with particles of 50-micrometre diameter (1.97×10−5 in). The powder is made of pure food-grade plant/vegetable starch.
The World Crokinole Championships in Tavistock, Ontario, Canada, states: ""The WCC waxes boards, as required, with paste wax. On tournament day powdered shuffleboard wax (CAPO fast speed, yellow and white container) is placed in the ditch. Only tournament organizers will apply quality granular shuffleboard wax. Wax will be placed in the ditch area so that players can rub their discs in the wax prior to shooting, if they desire. Contestants are not allowed to apply lubricants of any type to the board. Absolutely no other lubricant will be allowed"".

Cabinet collective responsibility,"Cabinet collective responsibility, also known as collective ministerial responsibility, is a constitutional convention in parliamentary systems and a cornerstone of the Westminster system of government, that members of the cabinet must publicly support all governmental decisions made in Cabinet, even if they do not privately agree with them. This support includes voting for the government in the legislature. This convention formed in the 19th century in the United Kingdom. Some political parties, most commonly communist, apply a similar convention of democratic centralism to their central committee.
If a member of the Cabinet wishes to openly object to a Cabinet decision then they are obliged to resign from their position in the Cabinet.
Cabinet collective responsibility is related to the fact that if a vote of no confidence is passed in parliament, the government is responsible collectively, and thus the entire government resigns. The consequence will be that a new government will be formed or parliament will be dissolved and a general election will be called. Cabinet collective responsibility is not the same as individual ministerial responsibility, which states that ministers are responsible for the running of their departments, and therefore culpable for the departments' mistakes.

Overview
Cabinet collective responsibility is a tradition in parliamentary governments in which the prime minister is responsible for appointing the cabinet ministers. The cabinet ministers are usually selected from the same political party as the prime minister to make collective decision-making for legislation faster and more effective. Unlike a presidential system, as used, for example, in the United States, a parliamentary system's executive and legislative branches are intertwined. Because of the fusion of powers of the executive and legislative branches the prime minister relies on the cabinet to always support policy decisions. A breach of cabinet collective responsibility, such as when a cabinet member publicly disagrees with an executive decision, results in resignation or termination from the cabinet. The New South Wales Parliamentary Library Research Service in Australia explains that ""one aspect of collective ministerial responsibility is that Ministers share responsibility for major government decisions, particularly those made by the cabinet and, even if they personally object to such decisions, Ministers must be prepared to accept and defend them or resign from the cabinet"".
Cabinet collective responsibility consists of two main features:

Cabinet confidentiality
the members of the cabinet must not reveal the content of discussions which take place. This allows for cabinet members to privately debate and raise concerns.
Cabinet solidarity
the members of the cabinet must publicly show a unified position, and must vote with the government even if they privately disagree with the decision that has been made.
Collective responsibility is not circumvented",politics
Criticism of technology,"Criticism of technology is an analysis of adverse impacts of industrial and digital technologies. It is argued that, in all advanced industrial societies (not necessarily only capitalist ones), technology becomes a means of domination, control, and exploitation, or more generally something which threatens the survival of humanity.  Some of the technology opposed by the most radical critics may include everyday household products, such as refrigerators, computers, and medication. However, criticism of technology comes in many shades.

Overview
Prominent authors elaborating a critique of technology include Donna J. Haraway, Jacques Ellul, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Joanna Bryson, E. F. Schumacher, Kate Crawford, Gilles Deleuze, Ted Kaczynski, Paul Virilio, Ivan Illich, Ritesh Kumar, Ursula Franklin, Ray Bradbury, Jean Baudrillard, Vandana Shiva, Lord Dunsany, Lafcadio Hearn, Nicholas G. Carr, Kafū Nagai, ZUN, J.R.R.Tolkein, C.S.Lewis, Langdon Winner, Joseph Weizenbaum, Hans Jonas, Theodore Roszak, Siegfried Kracauer, Karel Čapek, Sigfried Giedion, Günther Anders, Stanisław Lem, Neil Postman, William Morris, Martin Heidegger, Vilem Flusser, Jacques Tati, Hito Steyerl, Émile P. Torres, Oswald Spengler, Pentti Linkola, Andrew Feenberg, David Skrbina, Mike Cooley, John Zerzan, Lewis Mumford, Derrick Jensen, and Layla AbdelRahim. Some authors such as Chellis Glendinning and Kirkpatrick Sale consider themselves Neo-Luddites and hold that technological progress has had a negative impact on humanity. Their work focused on seeking meaning out of technological change, specifically wrestling with the question of ""how tools and their affordances change and alter the fabric of everyday life."" Ellul, for instance, maintained that when people assert that technology is an instrument of freedom or the means to achieve historical destiny or the execution of divine vocation, it results in the glorification and sanctification of Technique so that it becomes that which gives meaning and value to life rather than mere ensemble of materials. This is echoed by rhetorical critics who cite the way technological discourse damages institutions and individuals who make up those institutions due to its idealization and capacity to define social hierarchies.
In its most extreme, criticisms of technology produce analyses of technology as potentially leading to catastrophe. For instance, activist Naomi Klein described how technology is employed by capitalism in its commitment to a ""shock doctrine"", which promotes a series of crises so that speculative profit can be accumulated. There are theorists who also cite the cases of the global financial crises as well as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters to support their critique. Critiques also focus on specific issues such as how technology—through robotics, automation, and software—is destroying people's jobs faster than it is creating them, contributing to the incidence of poverty and inequality.
In the 1970s in the US, the critique of ",technology
Far-right politics,"Far-right politics, often termed right-wing extremism, encompasses a range of ideologies that are marked by radical conservatism, authoritarianism, ultra-nationalism, and nativism. This political spectrum situates itself on the far end of the right, distinguished from more mainstream right-wing ideologies by its opposition to liberal democratic norms and emphasis on exclusivist views. Far-right ideologies have historically included fascism, Nazism, and Falangism, while contemporary manifestations also incorporate neo-fascism, neo-Nazism, white supremacy, and various other movements characterized by chauvinism, xenophobia, and theocratic or reactionary beliefs.
Key to the far-right worldview is the notion of societal purity, often invoking ideas of a homogeneous ""national"" or ""ethnic"" community. This view generally promotes organicism, which perceives society as a unified, natural entity under threat from diversity or modern pluralism. Far-right movements frequently target perceived threats to their idealized community, whether ethnic, religious, or cultural, leading to anti-immigrant sentiments, welfare chauvinism, and, in extreme cases, political violence or oppression. According to political theorists, the far-right appeals to those who believe in maintaining strict cultural and ethnic divisions and a return to traditional social hierarchies and values.
In practice, far-right movements differ widely by region and historical context. In Western Europe, they have often focused on anti-immigration and anti-globalism, while in Eastern Europe, strong anti-communist rhetoric is more common. The United States has seen a unique evolution of far-right movements that emphasize nativism and radical opposition to central government. 

Far-right politics have led to oppression, political violence, forced assimilation, ethnic cleansing, and genocide against groups of people based on their supposed inferiority or their perceived threat to the native ethnic group, nation, state, national religion, dominant culture, or conservative social institutions. Across these contexts, far-right politics has continued to influence discourse, occasionally achieving electoral success and prompting significant debate over its place in democratic societies.

Overview
Concept and worldview
According to scholars Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, the core of the far right's worldview is organicism, the idea that society functions as a complete, organized and homogeneous living being. Adapted to the community they wish to constitute or reconstitute (whether based on ethnicity, nationality, religion or race), the concept leads them to reject every form of universalism in favor of autophilia and alterophobia, or in other words the idealization of a ""we"" excluding a ""they"". The far right tends to absolutize differences between nations, races, individuals or cultures since they disrupt their efforts towards the utopian dream of the ""closed"" and naturally organized society, perceiv",politics

Prodromus,"A prodromus ('forerunner' or 'precursor') aka prodrome is a term used in the natural sciences to describe a preliminary publication intended as the basis for a later, more comprehensive work.
It is also a medical term used for a premonitory symptom, that is, a symptom indicating the onset of a disease.
The origin of the word is from the 19th century: via French from New Latin prodromus, from Greek prodromos forerunner.
Nicolas Steno's De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus, one of the early treatises attempting to explain the occurrence of fossils in solid rock.
Ludovico Marracci's Arabic edition and Latin translation of the Qur’an was published in 1698. His ‘Introduction’ (Prodromus) had been published seven years earlier.
Other notable prodromi include Prodromus Entomology, Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis.

Holocene,"The Holocene () is the current geological epoch, beginning approximately 11,700 years ago. It follows the Last Glacial Period, which concluded with the Holocene glacial retreat. The Holocene and the preceding Pleistocene together form the Quaternary period. The Holocene is an interglacial period within the ongoing glacial cycles of the Quaternary, and is equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage 1.
The Holocene correlates with the last maximum axial tilt towards the Sun of the Earth's obliquity. The Holocene corresponds with the rapid proliferation, growth, and impacts of the human species worldwide, including all of its written history, technological revolutions, development of major civilizations, and overall significant transition towards urban living in the present. The human impact on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for the future evolution of living species, including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence, or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of the human impact. In July 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene Epoch into three distinct ages based on the climate, Greenlandian (11,700 years ago to 8,200 years ago), Northgrippian (8,200 years ago to 4,200 years ago) and Meghalayan (4,200 years ago to the present), as proposed by the International Commission on Stratigraphy. The oldest age, the Greenlandian, was characterized by a warming following the preceding ice age. The Northgrippian Age is known for vast cooling due to a disruption in ocean circulations that was caused by the melting of glaciers. The most recent age of the Holocene is the present Meghalayan, which began with extreme drought that lasted around 200 years.

Etymology
The word Holocene was formed from two Ancient Greek words. Hólos (ὅλος) is the Greek word for ""whole"". ""Cene"" comes from the Greek word kainós (καινός), meaning ""new"". The concept is that this epoch is ""entirely new"". The suffix '-cene' is used for all the seven epochs of the Cenozoic Era.

Overview
The International Commission on Stratigraphy has defined the Holocene as starting approximately 11,700 years before 2000 CE (11,650 cal years BP, or 9,700 BCE). The Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) regards the term 'recent' as an incorrect way of referring to the Holocene, preferring the term 'modern' instead to describe current processes. It also observes that the term 'Flandrian' may be used as a synonym for Holocene, although it is becoming outdated. The International Commission on Stratigraphy, however, considers the Holocene to be an epoch following the Pleistocene and specifically following the last glacial period. Local names for the last glacial period include the Wisconsinan in North America, the Weichselian in Europe, the Devensian in Britain, the Llanquihue in Chile and the Otiran in New Zealand.
The Holocene can be subdivided into five time intervals, or chronozones, based on climatic fluctuatio",history
List of anti–nuclear power groups,"Anti-nuclear power groups have emerged in every country that has had a nuclear power programme. Protest movements against nuclear power first emerged in the US, at the local level, and spread quickly to Europe and the rest of the world. National nuclear campaigns emerged in the late 1970s. Fuelled by the Three Mile Island accident and the Chernobyl disaster, the anti-nuclear power movement mobilised political and economic forces which for some years ""made nuclear energy untenable in many countries"".
Some of these anti-nuclear power organisations are reported to have developed considerable expertise on nuclear power and energy issues. In 1992, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that ""his agency had been pushed in the right direction on safety issues because of the pleas and protests of nuclear watchdog groups"".

Pearl ball,"Pearl ball is a traditional Chinese game which is similar to basketball. Two teams of six players compete to shoot the ball into a net in the opposing team's half of the field; players are required to play in certain parts of the field according to their role, with three players on each team attacking, two holding paddles attempting to deflect the ball away from the net, and one moving around in the scoring area while holding the net itself, attempting to help their teammates score.
The game is a traditional sport of the Manchu people. It originates from Manchu pearl diving into the rivers of Manchuria during Imperial China, where divers would play the game for leisure after pearling. In Manchu, the game is also called Ti He (pearl-kicking), Cai He (pearl-picking), and Reng He (pearl-tossing). It is recognised as an official sport of China by the Chinese Olympic Committee, and is played in the Chinese National Ethnic Games.

Rules
A match of pearl ball is divided into two 15-minutes halves with 10-minute breaks in between.
The field is 28 by 15 metres (92 by 49 ft), and is separated into three areas - the competition, defence, and scoring zones.

Chuckwagon racing,"Chuckwagon racing is an equestrian rodeo sport in which drivers in a chuckwagon led by a team of Thoroughbred horses race around a track.
The sport is most popular in the Prairie Provinces of Canada, where the World Professional Chuckwagon Association and the Canadian Professional Chuckwagon Association are the two major racing circuits. The most famous chuckwagon race in the world is held annually at the Calgary Stampede, where the total prize money for the ten-day event tops C$2 million ($1.5 million USD). The WPCA submits 25 drivers to the Calgary Stampede, while the CPCA submits 11 drivers. The sport is controversial, as horses and drivers have been injured or died, prompting animal welfare groups to call for it to be banned.
In 1986, adapted versions of the sport were adopted in Central Arkansas, and have evolved into an ever-growing spectator sport in the Midwest and MidSouth, USA. The National Championship Chuckwagon Races are held over Labor Day Weekend in Clinton, Arkansas on The ōf Ranch, owned by Dan and Peggy Eoff. The event is widely regarded as one of the largest equine events in the world. With over 6,000 horses and mules on the ranch throughout the weekend, and over 20,000 campers and spectators, the National Championships have grown into a yearly tradition and celebration of old Western culture. The Arkansas format of wagon racing has branched out into The Arkansas Chuckwagon Racing Association, which sanctions over a half-dozen weekend racing events across Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama. Races are captured and broadcast through The Chuckwagon Channel.

Race format
Each chuckwagon racing team is led by a driver, who commands a team of horses pulling the chuckwagon. The driver is supported by two or four outriders, each racing individual thoroughbred horses that follow the chuckwagon. Each race typically involves three or four teams, and begins with the outriders ""breaking camp"", by tossing two tent poles (with four outriders only) and a barrel representing a camp stove into the back of their wagon before mounting their horses and following the wagons as they complete a figure eight around two barrels before circling a race track. The first wagon to cross the finish line typically wins, although various time penalties are handed out for infractions such as a barrel being knocked over, a tent pole or stove not loaded, wagon interference, or an outrider crossing the finish line too far behind his wagon driver.

History
The first time chuckwagon races were held as a spectator sport was at the 1923 Calgary Stampede. Guy Weadick, who had founded the Stampede eleven years previously, invited ranchers to enter their chuckwagons and crews to compete for a total of $275 in prize money. In 2009, the total purse available to racers was $1.15 million. Drivers can earn additional awards:

The Guy Weadick Award is awarded for overall sportsmanship and exemplifying the spirit of the Calgary Stampede.

Classification of advocacy groups,"An advocacy group is a group or an organization that tries to influence the government but does not hold power in the government. Advocacy groups are generally classified according to two broad typologies: their core aims (group–cause typology), and their relationship to government (insider–outsider typology).

Classification by aims
Early attempts to classify advocacy groups, first developed in the United Kingdom by J. D. Stewart in the 1950s, generally focused on who or what causes they represented.

Sectional groups
Sometimes referred to as ""protectionist groups"", ""private interest groups"" or simply ""interest groups"". Such groups are normally exclusive, as their membership is usually restricted to the section of society whose interests they represent: for example the British Medical Association (as those seeking to join the BMA must be medical practitioners or students training to enter the profession), or organisations such as the Law Society.
However, the most common sectional groups worldwide are financial interest groups. This includes business groups (such as the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the Confederation of British Industry, and the Nestlé Corporation (Switzerland)), labour groups (such as NASUWT, the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and the Trades Union Congress (United Kingdom); IG Metall (Germany); and the AFL–CIO (United States)), farm groups (such as the Irish Farmers' Association and the American Farm Bureau Federation), and professional groups (such as the American Bar Association).

Cause groups
Sometimes referred to as ""promotional groups"" or ""public interest groups"", these organisations campaign for a specific cause or objective, promoting approaches, issues or ideas that may not be of direct benefit to group members. They are invariably and explicitly non-partisan and represent a segment of society whose primary purpose is focused on promoting a particular cause or value. This therefore makes them more inclusive, as they generally try to establish wide popular support and do not implement as many restrictions on group membership. For example, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has become one of the largest and most visible UK cause groups, with over 1 million members (including 200,000 youth members), over 2,000 staff members and 13,000 volunteers nationwide.
This category is wide-ranging, including civil liberties groups such as Liberty, Amnesty International, the League Against Cruel Sports, Countryside Alliance, the Institute for Public Policy Research and Policy Exchange. Charities such as Save the Children may fall under this category, as well as churches and religious organizations (e.g., Catholic Action in Italy), veterans' groups (e.g., the Union Française des Associations d'Anciens Combattants et Victimes de Guerre), and groups supporting the rights of people with disabilities (e.g., the Organización Nacional de Ciegos Españoles (ONCE)), and some have even argued that organised re",politics
Luta Livre,"Luta Livre (Portuguese: [ˈlutɐ ˈlivɾi], lit. freestyle fighting or wrestling), known in Brazil as Luta Livre Brasileira (lit. Brazilian freestyle fighting) or Luta Livre Submission, and also Brazilian Submission Wrestling, is a Brazilian martial arts and combat sport created by Euclydes Hatem in Rio de Janeiro. Primarily a mixture of catch wrestling and kosen judo, there is also ground striking with the hands, feet, knees and elbows. Notable practitioners include Marco Ruas, Ebenezer Fontes Braga, Johil de Oliveira, Alexandre Franca Nogueira, Renato Sobral, Gesias Cavalcante, Pedro Rizzo, Darren Till and José Aldo.
There are two styles: esportiva (""sporting"") and combate (""ground strikes""); both styles are no-gi. In esportiva competitions, grappling techniques are the only techniques allowed to subdue the opponent. Another style developed later is called ""Luta Livre Vale Tudo"", which is similar to the modern MMA style which allows both standing and ground strikes and submissions.  Consequently, it is important to calmly strategize and execute moves with the aim to force the opponent to submit via armlock, leglock, choke or necklock, or to win by points (i.e. takedowns, domination position). Punches, kicks and other ""hard"" techniques are not allowed as this is considered more a sport than actual combat. Combate, on the other hand, includes striking techniques on the ground; palm strikes and kicks are allowed, but the ground fight and submissions are still the largest elements. This is also the form used in MMA-style fights.

Etymology
In Brazil, the name ""Luta Livre"" (lit. freestyle fighting) can be used for multiple styles of wrestling. Olympic Freestyle Wrestling is known as Luta Livre Olímpica (lit. olympic freestyle fighting), while Professional wrestling is called Luta Livre Profissional or simply Luta Livre, sometimes also referred as Telecatch. Catch-as-Catch-Can wrestling was introduced to Brazil in the early 20th century and received the name ""Luta Livre Americana"" (lit. American freestyle fighting) to differentiate from Greco-Roman wrestling (Portuguese: Luta Greco-Romana), as there was no forbidden holds or moves, thus ""livre"" (""free""). Later due the influence of Euclydes Hatem and other practitioners, Luta Livre started to diverge from Catch Wrestling (which was becoming predetermined professional wrestling) and becoming its own style of submission grappling, with its practitioners maintaining the moniker of ""Luta Livre"".
To clear the confusion, in the modern day some Luta Livre schools have adopted the name of ""Luta Livre Submission"" while others use ""Luta Livre Esportiva"" in order to differentiate from other similarly named fighting styles.

History
Luta Livre's founder is credited to be Euclydes ""Tatu"" Hatem, who was originally a catch wrestler.  Euclydes Hatem went by the name of Tatu.  He began teaching catch wrestling techniques to others in Rio de Janeiro in 1927 while experimenting with some of his own innovative techniques. Ta",sports
Vyavahāramālā,"Vyavahāramālā  is a treatise in Sanskrit on jurisprudence and legal practices composed by some scholar from Kerala  sometime during the 16th-17th centuries CE. This was the standard reference for legal practices in the  kingly courts of the erstwhile kingdoms of Travancore and Cochin till the adoption of modern legal practices under the supervision and guidance of John Munro (1778 – 1858) who had served as Resident and Diwan of the States of Travancore and Cochin between 1810 and 1819.  However, Munro's reforms did not make Vyavahāramālā completely obsolete. Munro used it to develop an Anglo-Indian code of law for the Travancore kingdom called Caṭṭavariyōla and established a hierarchy of courts and the rules for presenting cases in those courts.
Vyavahāramālā is a digest of rules on legal procedure extracted from the well-known ancient Smṛti called Parāśarasmṛiti. Based on the
selection and organization of the verses collected in the Vyavahāramālā one could see that is a it is a collection of verses on law and legal
procedure based on the Vyavahāranirṇaya of Varadaraja. It is a work consisting of 1234 verses and the main part is divided into 19 chapters called prakaraṇa-s. Before starting the prakaraṇa-s, the author has dealt with some general requirements of legal procedures like qualities of the judge, the layout of the court, etc. The first eleven prakaraṇa-s deal with civil laws, the next five prakaraṇa-s deal with criminal laws, the seventeenth prakaraṇa discusses laws relating to partition of property, the eighteenth one  deals with some further aspects of criminal laws and the final prakaraṇa is devoted miscellaneous topics not touched upon in the previous chapters.

Authorship
Ulloor S. Paramesvara Aiyer in his multi-volume ""Kerala Sahithya Charithram"" (""History of Literature in Kerala"") claimed that Mazhamaṅgalaṃ Nārāyaṇan Naṃpūtiri (c. 1540–1610) who hailed from Kerala, India was the author of Vyavahāramāla.
But curiously, in a Malyalam translation of Vyavahāramāla authored by Ulloor S. Paramesvara Aiyer himself, there is no mention of the authorship of Vyavahāramāla. It appears that the authorship of Vyavahāramāla has not been determined definitively.

Progress,"Progress is movement towards a perceived refined, improved, or otherwise desired state. It is central to the philosophy of progressivism, which interprets progress as the set of advancements in technology, science, and social organization efficiency – the latter being generally achieved through direct societal action, as in social enterprise or through activism, but being also attainable through natural sociocultural evolution – that progressivism holds all human societies should strive towards.
The concept of progress was introduced in the early-19th-century social theories, especially social evolution as described by Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. It was present in the Enlightenment's philosophies of history. As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.

Measuring progress
Specific indicators for measuring progress can range from economic data, technical innovations, change in the political or legal system, and questions bearing on individual life chances, such as life expectancy and risk of disease and disability.
GDP growth has become a key orientation for politics and is often taken as a key figure to evaluate a politician's performance. However, GDP has a number of flaws that make it a bad measure of progress, especially for developed countries. For example, environmental damage is not taken into account nor is the sustainability of economic activity. Wikiprogress has been set up to share information on evaluating societal progress. It aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas, initiatives and knowledge. HumanProgress.org is another online resource that seeks to compile data on different measures of societal progress.

Our World in Data is a scientific online publication, based at the University of Oxford, that studies how to make progress against large global problems such as poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality.
The mission of Our World in Data is to present ""research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems"".
The Social Progress Index is a tool developed by the International Organization Imperative Social Progress, which measures the extent to which countries cover social and environmental needs of its citizenry. There are fifty-two indicators in three areas or dimensions: Basic Human Needs, and Foundations of Wellbeing and Opportunities which show the relative performance of nations.
Indices that can be used to measure progress include:

Scientific progress
Scientific progress is the idea that the scientific community learns more over time, which causes a body of scientific knowledge to accumulate.  The chemists in the 19th century knew less about chemistry than the chemists in the 20th century, and they in turn knew less than the chemists in the 21st century. Looking forward, today's chemists reasonably expect that chemists in future centuries will know more than they do.

Rogaining,"Rogaining is an orienteering sport of long distance cross-country navigation,  involving both route planning and navigation between checkpoints using a variety of map types. In a rogaine, teams of two to five people choose which checkpoints to visit within a time limit with the intent of maximising their score. Teamwork, endurance, competition and an appreciation for the natural environment are features of the sport. Championship rogaines are 24 hours long, but rogaines can be as short as two hours.

History
Rogaining can trace its roots back to 1947 when the first of many events with some of the features of rogaines was organised by the Melbourne University Mountaineering Club. The events from the 1940s eventually led to the birth of the sport of rogaining in April 1976, in Melbourne, Australia. The sport was named, rules were adopted and the world’s first rogaining association was formed (the Victorian Rogaining Association). Growth of the association and the sport occurred rapidly over the next decade.
The word rogaining is derived from the names of three of the founders, Rod Phillips, Gail Davis (née Phillips) and Neil Phillips (RoGaiNe, hence ""rogaining"", ""rogainer"" etc.) who were all members of the Surrey-Thomas Rover Crew which organised the world's first rogaine. The name was formally adopted by the Victorian Rogaining Association at its inaugural annual general meeting in August 1976 and accepted by Scouts Australia and University bushwalking groups to give the new sport an identity in its own right.
World Rogaining Championships were first held in 1992, and then every two years from 1996 to 2012. Between 2012 and 2017 they were held every year, but changed back to every two years in 2017.The country arranging the World Championships is chosen two years in advance by the International Rogaining Federation.

Cultural studies,"Cultural studies is an academic field that explores the dynamics of contemporary culture (including the politics of popular culture) and its social and historical foundations. Cultural studies researchers investigate how cultural practices relate to wider systems of power associated with, or operating through, social phenomena. These include ideology, class structures, national formations, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, and generation. Employing cultural analysis, cultural studies views cultures not as fixed, bounded, stable, and discrete entities, but rather as constantly interacting and changing sets of practices and processes.
Cultural studies was initially developed by British Marxist academics in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and has been subsequently taken up and transformed by scholars from many different disciplines around the world. Cultural studies is avowedly and even radically interdisciplinary and can sometimes be seen as anti-disciplinary. A key concern for cultural studies practitioners is the examination of the forces within and through which socially organized people conduct and participate in the construction of their everyday lives.
Cultural studies combines a variety of politically engaged critical approaches including semiotics, Marxism, feminist theory, ethnography, post-structuralism, postcolonialism, social theory, political theory, history, philosophy, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, communication studies, political economy, translation studies, museum studies and art history/criticism to study cultural phenomena in various societies and historical periods. Cultural studies seeks to understand how meaning is generated, disseminated, contested, bound up with systems of power and control, and produced from the social, political and economic spheres within a particular social formation or conjuncture. The movement has generated important theories of cultural hegemony and agency. Its practitioners attempt to explain and analyze the cultural forces related and processes of globalization.
During the rise of neoliberalism in Britain and the U.S., cultural studies both became a global phenomenon, and attracted the attention of many conservative opponents both within and beyond universities for a variety of reasons. A worldwide movement of students and practitioners with a raft of scholarly associations and programs, annual international conferences and publications carry on work in this field today. Distinct approaches to cultural studies have emerged in different national and regional contexts.

Stuck: How Vaccine Rumors Start and Why They Don't Go Away,"Stuck: How Vaccine Rumors Start and Why They Don't Go Away (2020), published by Oxford University Press and written by the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's Vaccine Confidence Project, Heidi Larson, looks at what influences attitudes to vaccination. It was largely compiled before the COVID-19 pandemic and inspired by her feeling that the dialogue between scientists and the public regarding vaccines was becoming complex on a background of increasing online information.
Using historical examples, from 19th century protests against smallpox vaccination to 21st-century boycotts of polio vaccination programmes, to show how rumours about vaccinations spread, the book looks chiefly at high-income countries and examines the factors that form opinions about vaccination.

Publication
Stuck: How Vaccine Rumors Start and Why They Don't Go Away was published by Oxford University Press in 2020, and written by the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's Vaccine Confidence Project, Heidi Larson. It was largely compiled before the COVID-19 pandemic. It has 200 pages, of which 127 pages cover eight chapters, which are preceded by acknowledgements, prologue and an introduction, and are followed by notes and an index.

Synopsis
The book addresses misinformation related to vaccination, and asks how vaccine rumors start and why they do not go away. Looking chiefly at high-income countries, the book examines social, political, psychological and cultural factors that make up the various mind-sets to vaccination. Larson also uses historical examples, from 19th century protests against smallpox vaccination to 21st-century boycotts of polio vaccination programmes, to show how rumours about vaccinations spread. She writes: ""Digital media has certainly contributed to the social amplification of risk, but there is no single culprit in this wave of dissent.""
Larson was inspired by her feeling that the dialogue between scientists and the public, regarding vaccines, was becoming complex, against a background of a proliferation of online information. However, there is ""opportunity for change"", if vaccine experts can engage using social media.
The book concludes with a call to social media companies to take responsibility for the part their technology plays in disseminating information pertaining to vaccines, because ""for vaccine uptake to increase, the public must be inspired to protect one another"".

Reception
Released during the COVID-19 pandemic, The Lancet stated that ""at a time of increasing global uncertainty, Larson's values of respecting other people's views and engaging with them will be crucial"". With the challenges of misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines, Joan Donovan, writing in Nature, agreed with Larson's findings. The book was also reviewed in the New Scientist.

Isotropic bands,"In physiology, isotropic bands (better known as I bands) are the lighter bands of skeletal muscle cells (a.k.a. muscle fibers). Isotropic bands contain only actin-containing thin filaments. The thin filaments are placed between 2 myosin filaments and contain only the actin filaments of neighboring sarcomeres. Bisecting the I band and serving as an anchoring point for the two adjacent actin filaments is the Z disc. During muscle contraction, the I band will shorten, while an A band will maintain its width.

Cellular anatomy
The darker bands within skeletal muscle, known as anisotropic bands (A bands), encompass both thick and thin filaments and constitute the central region of the sarcomere, extending across the H-zone. Collectively, the A bands and the I bands create the distinctive striped appearance of skeletal muscle tissue. Tropomyosin, a protein, shields the myosin-binding sites, hindering actin from binding to myosin. It attaches to troponin, which secures it in place. During muscle relaxation, the troponin-tropomyosin complex inhibits myosin heads from binding to the active sites on actin microfilaments. Troponin also possesses a calcium ion binding site. These two regulatory proteins cooperate in response to calcium levels, overseeing sarcomere contraction. During muscle contraction, tropomyosin shifts to expose the myosin-binding site on an actin filament, allowing the interaction between actin and myosin microfilaments to occur. The initiation of contraction involves calcium ions binding to troponin, prompting a reaction that displaces tropomyosin from the actin filament binding sites. Consequently, myosin heads can attach to these exposed sites, forming cross-bridges and initiating muscle contraction.

Marn Grook,"Marn Grook, marn-grook or marngrook (also spelt Marn Gook) is the popular collective name for traditional Indigenous Australian football games played at gatherings and celebrations by sometimes more than 100 players. From the Woiwurung language of the Kulin people, it means ""ball"" and ""game"". 
These games featured punt kicking and catching a stuffed ball. They involved large numbers of players, and were played over an extremely large area. The game was subject to strict behavioural protocols: for instance all players had to be matched for size, gender and skin group relationship. However, to outside observers the game appeared to lack a team objective, having no real rules or scoring system. A winner could only be declared if one of the sides agreed that the other side had played better. Individual players who consistently exhibited outstanding skills, such as kicking or leaping higher than others to catch the ball, were often praised, but proficiency in the sport gave them no tribal influence.
The earliest accounts emerged decades after the European settlement of Australia, mostly from the colonial Victorian explorers and settlers. Historical reports support it as a widespread activity across south-eastern Australia of the Djabwurrung and Jardwadjali people and other tribes in the Wimmera, Mallee and Millewa regions of western Victoria. According to some accounts, the range extended to the Wurundjeri in the Yarra Valley, the Gunai people of Gippsland, and the Riverina in south-western New South Wales. The Warlpiri people of Central Australia played a very similar kicking and catching game with a possum skin ball, and the game was known as pultja. North of Brisbane in Queensland in the 1860s it was known as Purru Purru.
Some historians claim that Marn Grook had a role in the formation of Australian rules football, which originated in Melbourne in 1858 and was codified the following year by members of the Melbourne Football Club. This connection has become culturally important to many Indigenous Australians, including celebrities and professional footballers from communities in which Australian rules football is highly popular.

Early accounts
Although the consensus among historians is that Marn Grook existed before European arrival, it is not clear how long the game had been played in Victoria or elsewhere on the Australian continent.
A news article published in 1906 suggests that it had been observed around a century prior, which would put its first observations to Australia's earliest days as a convict colony.
The earliest recorded anecdotal account is from about 1841, a decade prior to the Victorian gold rush. Robert Brough Smyth in his 1878 book, The Aborigines of Victoria, quoted William Thomas, a Protector of Aborigines in Victoria, who stated that he had witnessed Wurundjeri Aboriginal people east of Melbourne playing the game:

The men and boys joyfully assemble when this game is to be played. One makes a ball of possum skin, somewhat ela",sports
Pork cycle,"In economics, the term pork cycle, hog cycle, or cattle cycle describes the phenomenon of cyclical fluctuations of supply and prices in livestock markets. It was first observed in 1925 in pig markets in the US by Mordecai Ezekiel and in Europe in 1927 by the German scholar Arthur Hanau.
While the pork cycle is so named for its genesis in the economic analysis of livestock; the phenomenon has far-spanning implications that capture most goods. In short, the pork cycle runs as thus:

A demand for pork emerges, and so one or two farmers begin raising pigs. While pig supply is limited, prices are high – at this point of the cycle, pork is a rare good.
More farmers realise the value potential and also begin raising pigs. As more and more piggeries come 'online,' the price begins to decrease as supply increases.
At some point, demand and supply equalise; or supply may outstrip demand. Pork may become a commodity, or consumers may get bored of pork.
In turn, farmers turn away from raising pigs, and go back to more valuable crops or livestock.
As a result, the pork supply begins to decline.
In turn, there are less farmers raising pigs, and so pork goes back to being a high-priced item.
The cycle resumes again.

Explanations of cycles in livestock markets
The cobweb model
Nicholas Kaldor proposed a model of fluctuations in agricultural markets called the cobweb model, based on production lags and adaptive expectations. In his model, when prices are high, more investments are made. However, the effect of these investments is delayed due to the breeding time - the production lag. Eventually, the market becomes saturated, leading to a decline in prices. Production is thus decreased and again, this takes time to be noticed, leading to increased demand and again increased prices. The cycle continues to repeat, producing a supply-demand graph resembling a cobweb.
The model has also been applied in certain labour sectors: high salaries in a particular sector lead to an increased number of students studying the relevant subject; when these students enter the job market at the same time after several years of studying, their job prospects and salaries are much worse due to the new surplus of applicants. This in turn deters students from studying this subject, producing a deficiency and higher wages once again.

An alternative model
Kaldor's model involves an assumption that investors make systematic mistakes. In his model, investing (i.e. breeding cattle rather than slaughtering them) when prices are high causes future prices to fall - foreseeing this (i.e. slaughtering more when prices are high) can yield higher profits for the investors. Sherwin Rosen, Kevin M. Murphy, and José Scheinkman (1994) proposed an alternative model in which cattle ranchers have perfectly rational expectations about future prices. They showed that even in this case, the three-year lifetime of beef cattle would cause rational ranchers to choose breeding versus slaughtering in a way that w",economics
Imperial overstretch,"Imperial overstretch, also known as imperial overreach, describes the situation in which an empire extends itself beyond its military-economic capabilities and often collapses as a result. The idea was popularised by Yale University historian Paul Kennedy in his 1987 book The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers. The idea was expanded upon by Jack Snyder in his 1991 book Myths of Empire.
Arguably, this was true of the Roman Empire, which was strong and effective in the first and early second centuries CE, despite a few setbacks (Germany in 9 CE; Scotland in the 80s CE) but lost territories after that (e.g. Dacia and Mesopotamia) and could not keep the Saxons, Huns and other ""barbarians"" out in the 4th and 5th centuries. It was also true of the Napoleonic Empire, which made rapid gains by conquest in the first decade after Napoleon became emperor of France, but became over-extended militarily when it attempted to conquer Russia in 1812. Likewise the principle three Axis powers all overextended themselves during World War II: Nazi Germany, waging war since 1939 in Western and Eastern Europe, was encircled, invaded, and fell in 1945; Imperial Japan led a total war in China and the Pacific Ocean; and fascist Italy, opening in 1940 simultaneous fronts in Africa, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean, suffered setbacks and fell in 1943.
According to Jack Snyder, imperial overstretch happens when notions that security can best be achieved through imperial expansion guide policymakers. Snyder refers to these ideas as ""myths of empire"", as they tend to be counterproductive.
Paul Kennedy's view has been criticised from many directions, including by the postmodern historiographer Hayden White, economic historian Niall Ferguson and Marxist writers such as Perry Anderson and Alex Callinicos.

Early Middle Ages,"The Early Middle Ages (or early medieval period), sometimes controversially referred to as the Dark Ages, is typically regarded by historians as lasting from the late 5th to the 10th century. They marked the start of the Middle Ages of European history, following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, and preceding the High Middle Ages (c. 11th to 14th centuries). The alternative term late antiquity, for the early part of the period, emphasizes elements of continuity with the Roman Empire, while Early Middle Ages is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the earlier medieval period.
The period saw a continuation of trends evident since late classical antiquity, including population decline, especially in urban centres, a decline of trade, a small rise in average temperatures in the North Atlantic region and increased migration. In the 19th century the Early Middle Ages were often labelled the Dark Ages, a characterization based on the relative scarcity of literary and cultural output from this time. The term is rarely used by academics today. The Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire, survived, though in the 7th century the Rashidun Caliphate and the Umayyad Caliphate conquered the southern part of the Roman territory.
Many of the listed trends reversed later in the period. In 800, the title of Emperor was revived in Western Europe with Charlemagne, whose Carolingian Empire greatly affected later European social structure and history. Europe experienced a return to systematic agriculture in the form of the feudal system, which adopted such innovations as three-field planting and the heavy plough. Barbarian migration stabilized in much of Europe, although the Viking expansion greatly affected Northern Europe.

History
Collapse of Rome
Starting in the 2nd century, various indicators of Roman civilization began to decline, including urbanization, seaborne commerce, and population. Archaeologists have identified only 40 percent as many Mediterranean shipwrecks from the 3rd century as from the first. Estimates of the population of the Roman Empire during the period from 150 to 400 suggest a fall from 65 million to 50 million, a decline of more than 20 percent. Some scholars have connected this de-population to the Dark Ages Cold Period (300–700), when a decrease in global temperatures impaired agricultural yields.

Early in the 3rd century Germanic peoples migrated south from Scandinavia and reached the Black Sea, creating formidable confederations which opposed the local Sarmatians. In Dacia (present-day Romania) and on the steppes north of the Black Sea the Goths, a Germanic people, established at least two kingdoms: Therving and Greuthung.
The arrival of the Huns in 372–375 ended the history of these kingdoms. The Huns, a confederation of central Asian tribes, founded an empire. They had mastered the difficult art of shooting composite recurve bows from horseback. The Goths sought refuge in Roman territory (376), agreeing to enter t",history

Medical Council of Iran,"The Medical Council of the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRIMC) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) which is responsible for licensing Iranian healthcare professionals. The Iranian Medical Council is the recognized trade union for all of its registered members. IRIMC is the umbrella organization which regulates bi or multilateral collaborations between Iranian healthcare professionals and other organizations. As the main national regulatory body for healthcare professionals, IRIMC oversees doctors and other licensed health workers to ensure that they fulfil their legal duty to maintain professional competence. This regulatory organization has the power to issue a warning to doctors as well as certain allied health workers, suspend and even revoke their license to practice.

History
In 1964, the Medical Council was first legislated by the Iranian Parliament which has been amended eight times in the following years. The last amendment was in 2004 when IRIMC legislation was approved by the country's Guardian Council of the Constitution.
On 1 October 2021, Dr Mohammad Raeiszadeh has been elected with 150 votes as the President of Iranian Medical Council in the new term.[1]
IRIMC main bodies are as follows:

The General Assembly
The Supreme Council
The President
The Board of Directors of Medical Council Branches
The Disciplinary Committees who examine the guild and professional violations of healthcare professionals and affiliated occupations
Inspectors
Welfare and Cooperation Fund 
Since 1996 CME has been mandatory for all health professionals. Administered by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and the Medical Council of Iran, CME programs are routinely running in all IRIMC branches across the country.
Recently IRIMC promotes the development of medical tourism through projects planned by Health Tourism Strategic Council comprising representatives of the Medical Council of Iran, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Health and Medical Education and the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism.

Facts on the ground,"Facts on the ground is a diplomatic and geopolitical term that means the situation in reality as opposed to in the abstract. The term was popularised in the 1970s in discussions of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict to refer to Israeli settlements built in the occupied West Bank, which were intended to establish permanent Israeli footholds in Palestinian territory.
Rashid Khalidi wrote in 2010: 

One reason Israel continues to build settlements is that, according to the so-called Clinton parameters laid down in 2000, a final Israeli–Palestinian agreement would grant sovereignty over Jewish-occupied areas to Israel, and Palestinian-inhabited areas to the new Palestinian state. Indeed, well over a decade of failed negotiations have only led to an acceleration of Israel's land grab in the Holy City. Israeli planners have spent this time pushing settlers into heavily Arab-inhabited areas of the city, such as Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan, and Abu Dis, in order to create fresh ""facts on the ground""—a tactic used by the Zionist movement for over a century in order to obtain control over more and more of Palestine.

Farm equity,"Farm equity refers to the net worth of the farm sector’s assets (i.e., farmland, machinery, equipment, facilities, crop and livestock inventories) against which there is no debt. This represents all farm proprietors’ residual claims to farm assets.
Increases in farm equity in the late 1970s became increasingly important for most agricultural producers as a source of additional collateral against which to obtain credit for operating and expansion purposes. The level of farm equity ranges widely from one farm to another.
The overall debt-asset ratio is a measure of the farm sector’s financial condition or solvency.

Data mining,"Data mining is the process of extracting and finding patterns in massive data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.
The term ""data mining"" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support systems, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.
The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of massive quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.
The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.
The related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of ",science
Agricultural value chain,"An agricultural value chain is the integrated range of goods and services (value chain) necessary for an agricultural product to move from the producer to the final consumer. The concept has been used since the beginning of the millennium, primarily by those working in agricultural development in developing countries, although there is no universally accepted definition of the term.

Background
The term value chain was first popularized in a book published in 1985 by Michael Porter,  who used it to illustrate how companies could achieve what he called “competitive advantage” by adding value within their organization. Subsequently, the term was adopted for agricultural development purposes  and has now become very much in vogue among those working in this field, with an increasing number of bilateral and multilateral aid organisations using it to guide their development interventions.
At the heart of the agricultural value chain concept is the idea of actors connected along a chain producing and delivering goods to consumers through a sequence of activities. However, this “vertical” chain cannot function in isolation and an important aspect of the value chain approach is that it also considers “horizontal” impacts on the chain, such as input and finance provision, extension support and the general enabling environment. The approach has been found useful, particularly by donors, in that it has resulted in a consideration of all those factors impacting on the ability of farmers to access markets profitably, leading to a broader range of chain interventions. It is used both for upgrading existing chains and for donors to identify market opportunities for small farmers.

Definitions
There is no commonly agreed definition of what is actually meant by agricultural value chains. Indeed, some agencies are using the term without having a workable definition or definitions and simply redefined ongoing activities as “value chain” work when the term came into vogue. Published definitions include the World Bank’s “the term ‘’value chain’’ describes the full range of value adding activities required to bring a product or service through the different phases of production, including procurement of raw materials and other inputs”, UNIDO’s “actors connected along a chain producing, transforming and bringing goods and services to end-consumers through a sequenced set of activities”, and CIAT’s “a strategic network among a number of business organizations”.
Without a universal definition, the term “value chain” is now being used to refer to a range of types of chain, including:

An international, or regional commodity market. Examples could include “the global cotton value chain”, “the southern African maize value chain” or “the Brazilian coffee value chain”;
A national or local commodity market or marketing system such as “the Ghanaian tomato value chain” or “”the Accra tomato value chain”;
A supply chain, which can cover both of the above;

Blind cricket,"Blind cricket is a version of the sport of cricket adapted for blind and partially sighted players. It has been governed by the World Blind Cricket Council (WBCC) since 1996. So far, five Blind World Cups have been held: New Delhi, India (1998); Chennai, India (2002); Islamabad, Pakistan (2006); Cape Town, South Africa (2014); and Sharjah, UAE (2018). In 2012, the first Blind World Cup T20 was held in Bangalore, India. Blind cricket relies on common use of the 'sweep shot', in order to provide maximum chance of the bat hitting the ball.

History
Blind cricket was invented in Melbourne in 1922 by two blind factory workers who improvised the game using a tin can containing rocks. The Victorian Blind Cricket Association was founded shortly after, in 1922, and the first sports ground and clubhouse for blind cricket was built at Kooyong, Melbourne in 1928.
The world's first test cricket match for the blind was played in 2000 between Pakistan and South Africa, in which Pakistan defeated South Africa by 94 runs.
South Africa won the first world championship in 1998, defeating Pakistan in the finals; Pakistan consecutively won the next two championships, defeating South Africa and India in the finals in 2002 and 2006. In 2014, the championship was won by India, defeating the two-time winner Pakistan.

Rules
The rules of blind cricket are based on the standard laws of cricket with some essential modifications.
WBCC international playing rules are codified in 25 clauses, first ratified in 2005.
There are a total number of 11 players in each team: at least four players who are totally blind (classified as B1) and three partially blind players (B2), and up to four partially sighted players (B3).
In terms of playing equipment, the major adaptation is the ball, which is significantly larger than a standard cricket ball and filled with ball bearings to provide audible cues. The size allows partially sighted players to see the ball and the contents allow blind players to hear it. The wicket (stumps) is also larger, made of metal tubes painted in fluorescent colours, to allow partially sighted players to see and blind players to touch it in order to correctly orient themselves when batting or bowling.
Various other modifications to the rules apply. Verbal signals are widely used both by umpires and players: in particular, the bowler must shout 'Play!' as he releases the ball. The delivery is required to pitch at least twice when bowled to a completely blind batsman (once when bowled to a partially sighted batsman), but must not be rolling. Totally blind batsmen cannot be out due to being stumped, and must be found to be LBW twice before going out. Totally blind fielders are allowed to take a catch on the bounce.

The WBCC was established in 1996 during an international cricket meeting held in New Delhi, India in September 1996. The WBCC was set up with the objective of promoting and administering the game of blind cricket global",sports
Regulation of alternative medicine,"Because of the uncertain nature of various alternative therapies and the wide variety of claims different practitioners make, alternative medicine has been a source of vigorous debate, even over the definition of ""alternative medicine"". Dietary supplements, their ingredients, safety, and claims, are a continual source of controversy. In some cases, political issues, mainstream medicine and alternative medicine all collide, such as in cases where synthetic drugs are legal but the herbal sources of the same active chemical are banned.
In other cases, controversy over mainstream medicine causes questions about the nature of a treatment, such as water fluoridation. Alternative medicine and mainstream medicine debates can also spill over into freedom of religion discussions, such as the right to decline lifesaving treatment for one's children because of religious beliefs. Government regulators continue to attempt to find a regulatory balance.
Jurisdiction differs concerning which branches of alternative medicine are legal, which are regulated, and which (if any) are provided by a government-controlled health service or reimbursed by a private health medical insurance company. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – article 34 (Specific legal obligations) of the General Comment No. 14 (2000) on The right to the highest attainable standard of health – states that

Furthermore, obligations to respect include a State's obligation to refrain from prohibiting or impeding traditional preventive care, healing practices and medicines, from marketing unsafe drugs and from applying coercive medical treatments, unless on an exceptional basis for the treatment of mental illness or the prevention and control of communicable diseases.
Specific implementations of this article are left to member states. Two governments, acting under the laws of their respective countries, maintain websites for public information making a distinction between ""alternative medicine"" and ""complementary medicine"". In North America, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) states:

""...people often use the words “alternative” and “complementary” interchangeably, but the two terms refer to different concepts: 'Complementary' generally refers to using a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine. 'Alternative' refers to using a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine. True alternative medicine is not common. Most people use non-mainstream approaches along with conventional treatments. And the boundaries between complementary and conventional medicine overlap and change with time. For example, guided imagery and massage, both once considered complementary or alternative, are used regularly in some hospitals to help with pain management.""[7]

The term was coined in February 2003 in a North Carolina restaurant, and was widely publicized a month later when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias. The political renaming occurred in context of France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although some restaurants around the nation adopted the renaming, the term became unpopular, in part due to decreasing popularity of the Iraq War. After Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, the change of name in congressional cafeterias was reverted.

Background
French opposition to the Iraq war
After the September 11 attacks by Al-Qaeda and the declaration of a ""War on Terror"" by President George W. Bush, an invasion of Iraq was proposed. During the United Nations Security Council deliberations, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin made it clear France would neither support nor participate in the invasion, and that it would veto any resolution that mandates an invasion of Iraq. Though Russia and China also opposed the invasion, they had not threatened to use their veto power on the Security Council; as such, France was perceived as the main barrier to the American and British effort to secure a UN mandate for invasion. This caused some Americans to accuse France of betrayal, reigniting prior anti-French sentiment in the United States.

Initial renaming
Renaming was initiated in February 2003 by Beaufort, North Carolina, ""Cubbie's"" restaurant owner Neal Rowland, who said he was motivated by similar actions against Germany in World War I, when ""sauerkraut was called liberty cabbage, and frankfurters were renamed hot dogs."" (The term hot dog was in use well before the outbreak of World War I. In fact, sauerkraut was renamed victory cabbage and Frankfurters were renamed liberty dogs.)  In an interview about the name change, Rowland commented, ""since the French are backing down [from the war], French fries and French everything needs to be banned."" In March 2007, Rowland obtained a trademark registration for the term ""freedom fries"", which was cancelled in November 2013.

U.S. House adoption
On March 11, 2003, Republican U.S. Representatives Bob Ney and Walter B. Jones directed the three House cafeterias to change all references to French fries, French toast, and French bread on menus, and replace them with Freedom fries, Freedom toast, and Freedom bread, respectively. Jones chose to follow Cubbie's example by circulating a letter to his colleagues advocating their renaming because, he said, ""the French were 'sitting on the sidelines.'"" As Ney was Chairman of the United States House Committee on House Administration, the action did not require any vote, as the committee has authority over House cafeterias. According to a statement released by Ney, the renaming was intended to express displeasure w",politics
Private landowner assistance program,"Private landowner assistance program (PLAP) is a class of government assistance program available throughout the U.S. for landowners interested in maintaining, developing, improving and protecting wildlife on their property. Each state provides various programs that assist landowners in agriculture, forestry and conserving wildlife habitat. This helps landowners in the practice of good land stewardship and provides multiple benefits to the environment. Some states offer technical assistance which includes:

assisting the landowner to decide which programs will fit the landowner's needs,
assist landowners with processes/procedures,
and assist in coming up with a plan that will be beneficial to the species present on their land while preserving their natural habitat.

Landowner incentive programs
Landowner incentive programs work to financially assist landowners in the restoration and protection of endangered species Generally any private landowner or organization can apply for assistance but preference is given to areas in greatest need of protection.
Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP)
WHIP is a voluntary landowner program that is devoted to the improvement of upland wildlife habitat. It is available in all 50 states and has enrolled nearly 11,000 landowners totaling 1,600,000 acres (6,500 km2) since its beginning in 1998. Eligibility is limited to privately owned, federal, tribal and government lands (Limited). Once approved, land management plans are designed with one of two primary agendas.

Habitat for declining species
Wildlife and fishery habitats and sustainable practices
Proposed management plans are considered for 5,10 or 15 year time spans with increased cost-share benefits for longer commitments.
Forest Land Enhancement Program (FLEP)
FLEP is a type of USDS incentive program designed to maintain the long term sustainability of non-industrial private forest. The program provides financial and educational assistance to landowners that compose a qualifying management plan. Initially proposed plans must be 10 years management strategies and can manage no more than 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) (additional area can be added in special cases).
Tax incentives
Another way landowners can be persuaded to conserve their private land is through tax incentive programs. For example, Louisiana has a tax exemption program providing tax relief for landowner that commit to specific management plans.

Agricultural conversion programs
Conservation Reserve Program - State Acres for wildlife Enhancement (SAFE)
The United States Department of Agriculture USDA started the Conservation Reserve Program as part of the Food Security Act of 1985. The program is designed to provide assistance and incentive for farmers to maintain sustainable farming practices and to encourage the development of natural wildlife habitat.
The State Acres for wildlife Enhancement (SAFE) program was approved by the USDS as an offshoot of the Conservation Reserve Program. The program is ",economics
Entryism,"Entryism (also called entrism, enterism, infiltration, a French Turn, boring from within, or boring-from-within) is a political strategy in which an organization or state encourages its members or supporters to join another, usually larger, organization in an attempt to expand influence and expand their ideas and program. If the organization being ""entered"" is hostile to entryism, the entryists may engage in a degree of subterfuge and subversion to hide the fact that they are an organization in their own right.

Socialist entryism
""Boring from within""
One entryist strategy that took place in the United States is called the ""boring from within"" strategy. Radical workers would join established (and often conservative) trade unions and attempt to join their leadership to shift their stances leftward. These workers were called ""borers"". Boring was opposed by radical workers who supported dual unionism, where radical unions would attempt to win over workers and firm-level union locals from the established trade unions.
Starting in the 1890s, a faction of the Socialist Labor Party – which would split to become the Socialist Party of America – began ""boring from within"" in an attempt to make the American Federation of Labor (AFL) more radical. In contrast, the Industrial Workers of the World – and another faction of the Socialist Labor Party, close to the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, which would remain in the party – supported a dual unionist strategy of competing against the AFL within a workplace.
In opposition, Daniel De Leon of the Socialist Labor Party criticized ""boring from within only"" and supported ""boring from within and without"". SLP members were encouraged to join the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance and later the Workers' International Industrial Union.
In 1929, the Communist Party of America abandoned ""boring from within"" the AFL and embraced dual unionism against the AFL. As a result, its labor organization, the Trade Union Educational League (TUEL) became the Trade Union Unity League (TUUL).

Trotsky's ""French Turn""
The ""French Turn"" refers to the classic form of entryism advocated by Leon Trotsky in his essays on ""The French Turn"". In June 1934, he proposed for the French Trotskyists to dissolve their Communist League and to join the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) and for the Communist League to dissolve its youth section to join more easily with revolutionary elements. The tactic was adopted in August 1934, despite some opposition, and successfully raised the group's membership to 300 activists.
Proponents of the tactic advocated that the Trotskyists should enter the social democratic parties to connect with revolutionary socialist currents within them and then to steer those currents toward Leninism. However, entryism lasted briefly since the leadership of the SFIO started to expel the Trotskyists. The Trotskyists of the Workers Party of the United States also successfully used their entry into the Social",politics
Nanoelectromechanical systems,"Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are a class of devices integrating electrical and mechanical functionality on the nanoscale. NEMS form the next logical miniaturization step from so-called microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS devices. NEMS typically integrate transistor-like nanoelectronics with mechanical actuators, pumps, or motors, and may thereby form physical, biological, and chemical sensors. The name derives from typical device dimensions in the nanometer range, leading to low mass, high mechanical resonance frequencies, potentially large quantum mechanical effects such as zero point motion, and a high surface-to-volume ratio useful for surface-based sensing mechanisms. Applications include accelerometers and sensors to detect chemical substances in the air.

History
Background
As noted by Richard Feynman in his famous talk in 1959, ""There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom,"" there are many potential applications of machines at smaller and smaller sizes; by building and controlling devices at smaller scales, all technology benefits.  The expected benefits include greater efficiencies and reduced size, decreased power consumption and lower costs of production in electromechanical systems.
The first silicon dioxide field effect transistors were built by Frosch and Derick in 1957 at Bell Labs. In 1960, Atalla and Kahng at Bell Labs fabricated a MOSFET with a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm. In 1962, Atalla and Kahng fabricated a nanolayer-base metal–semiconductor junction (M–S junction) transistor that used gold (Au) thin films with a thickness of 10 nm. In 1987, Bijan Davari led an IBM research team that demonstrated the first MOSFET with a 10 nm oxide thickness. Multi-gate MOSFETs enabled scaling below 20 nm channel length, starting with the FinFET. The FinFET originates from the research of Digh Hisamoto at Hitachi Central Research Laboratory in 1989. At UC Berkeley, a group led by Hisamoto and TSMC's Chenming Hu fabricated FinFET devices down to 17 nm channel length in 1998.

NEMS
In 2000, the first very-large-scale integration (VLSI) NEMS device was demonstrated by researchers at IBM. Its premise was an array of AFM tips which can heat/sense a deformable substrate in order to function as a memory device (Millipede memory).  Further devices have been described by Stefan de Haan. In 2007, the International Technical Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) contains NEMS memory as a new entry for the Emerging Research Devices section.

Atomic force microscopy
A key application of NEMS is atomic force microscope tips.  The increased sensitivity achieved by NEMS leads to smaller and more efficient sensors to detect stresses, vibrations, forces at the atomic level, and chemical signals. AFM tips and other detection at the nanoscale rely heavily on NEMS.

Approaches to miniaturization
Two complementary approaches to fabrication of NEMS can be found, the top-down approach and the bottom-up approach.
The top-down approach uses the traditional microfab",science

Psychiatry,"Psychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of deleterious mental conditions. These include matters related to cognition, perceptions, mood, emotion, and behavior.
Initial psychiatric assessment of a person begins with creating a case history and conducting a mental status examination. Laboratory tests, physical examinations, and psychological tests may be conducted. On occasion, neuroimaging or neurophysiological studies are performed. 
Mental disorders are diagnosed in accordance with diagnostic manuals such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), edited by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) was published in May 2013.
Treatment may include psychotropics (psychiatric medicines), psychotherapy, substance-abuse treatment, and other modalities such as interventional approaches, assertive community treatment, community reinforcement, and supported employment. 
Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or risk to the individual or community. 
Research within psychiatry is conducted by psychiatrists on an interdisciplinary basis with other professionals, including clinical psychologists, epidemiologists, nurses, social workers, and occupational therapists.

Etymology
The term psychiatry was first coined by the German physician Johann Christian Reil in 1808 and literally means the 'medical treatment of the soul' (ψυχή psych- 'soul' from Ancient Greek psykhē 'soul'; -iatry 'medical treatment' from Gk. ιατρικός iātrikos 'medical' from ιάσθαι iāsthai 'to heal'). A medical doctor specializing in psychiatry is a psychiatrist (for a historical overview, see: Timeline of psychiatry).

Theory and focus
Psychiatry refers to a field of medicine focused specifically on the mind, aiming to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders in humans. It has been described as an intermediary between the world from a social context and the world from the perspective of those who are mentally ill.
People who specialize in psychiatry often differ from most other mental health professionals and physicians in that they must be familiar with both the social and biological sciences. The discipline studies the operations of different organs and body systems as classified by the patient's subjective experiences and the objective physiology of the patient. Psychiatry treats mental disorders, which are conventionally divided into three general categories: mental illnesses, severe learning disabilities, and personality disorders. Although the focus of psychiatry has changed little over time, the diagnostic and treatment processes have evolved dramatically and continue to do so. Since the late 20th century, the field of psychiatry has continued to become more biological and less conceptually is",science
Balance of power (parliament),"In parliamentary politics, balance of power is a situation in which one or more members of a parliamentary or similar chamber can by their uncommitted vote enable a party to attain and remain in minority government. The term may also be applied to the members who hold that position. The members holding the balance of power may guarantee their support for a government by either joining it in a coalition government or by an assurance that they will vote against any motion of no confidence in the government or will abstain in such a vote. In return for such a commitment, such members may demand legislative or policy commitments from the party they are to support. A person or party may also hold a balance of power in a chamber without any commitment to government, in which case both the government and opposition groupings may on occasion need to negotiate for that person's or party's support.

Australia
House of Representatives
In the 1940 federal election of the 74 seats in the House of Representatives, the United Australia/Country Coalition won 36 seats, the Labor Party won 32, the Non-Communist Labor Party won 4, and there were two independents, leaving the United Australia government of Robert Menzies without a majority in the lower house. The Coalition continued in government with the support of the two independents. The following year, the Non-Communist Labor Party, a breakaway Labor faction associated with former New South Wales premier Jack Lang, was readmitted to the Labor Party, and after the removal of Menzies by his own party, the independents in Parliament switched their support to Labor, allowing Opposition Leader John Curtin to form a minority government until his landslide reelection in 1943.
After the 2010 federal election of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives, both the Labor Party and the Liberal/National Coalition held 72 seats, and there was one Greens, one MP was a member of the National Party of Western Australia (which is not part of the Liberal/National Coalition), and four independents. After several weeks of negotiations, Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard eventually retained power after signing separate confidence and supply agreements with the Greens and three of the independents. The agreements required the non-government party to support the government in a no-confidence motion and on supply bills, in return for the passage of some legislation, such as setting up an emissions trading scheme in the case of the Greens (see Gillard Government § Minority government). The Labor minority government was able to govern for the full term of the house.

Thiers old hospital,"Thiers old hospital (Ancien hôpital de Thiers, in French) is the former site of a hospital dating back to the 17th century, located in the eastern part of the historic center of Thiers, France. The site covers an area of 0.5 ha, and the buildings cover more than 7,000 m². It is located within the perimeter of Thiers' site patrimonial remarquable (remarkable heritage site), and remains protected under the town's Plan de sauvegarde et de mise en valeur (Protection and Enhancement Plan). Like the rest of Thiers' old town, the site has underground passages and cellars.
Closed in 1988 following the hospital's move to new premises at the Thiers hospital center, the site remained partially abandoned before being totally abandoned following the departure of the medical-psychological consultation center in 2016.

Location
Thiers old hospital is located in the French department of Puy-de-Dôme, in the commune of Thiers. Located to the east of the town's medieval heart, it is built on top of part of the 4th wall of the Thiers city walls, which serves as a retaining wall. The hospital overlooks the Vallée des Usines and the surrounding historic center. The building is not visible when entering the town from the west, being hidden by medieval buildings and the Saint-Genès church just a few metres away.

General layout
History
Origins
The Thiers hospital was established in the 17th century as a result of the merger of three pre-existing establishments: the Hôtel-Dieu Vieux de la Charité, founded long ago and administered by the Thiers chapter; the Hôtel-Dieu Neuf de la Trinité, dating from the mid 16th century and administered by the municipality; and the Hôtel-Dieu Neuf de la Charité, dating from the mid 17th century. These charitable establishments took in the needy and provided them with rudimentary medical care. They also took in orphans and provided them with professional training. In the early 1660s, there was a desire to bring these three entities together in a single location on Rue Mancel-Chabot. The general hospital, founded by patent on January 9, 1668, opened its doors on April 15, 1669. In addition to their charitable aspects, hospitals of the time were also used to rid towns of their destitute inhabitants, which was ruthlessly done in Thiers from the very first days of the establishment's operation.

Expansions and demolitions
When the hospital first opened, only the north wing of the current building and the chapel were present. In 1750, the hospital was expanded with the construction of the present-day south wing, a symmetrical continuation of the north wing. In 1836, a number of alterations were recorded, notably to the chapel and the historic building - the north wing in particular. In 1937, the building was expanded again. The north wing was replaced by a new wing to the north-east of the site, housing surgery on the lower floors and maternity on the top floor.

Single-bamboo drifting,"Single-bamboo drifting or duzhu drifting (Chinese: 独竹漂) is a sport traditionally practiced by various people inhabiting the Chishui River basin in Guizhou Province. Practitioners either perform dance movements or race one another using the bamboo log as balance. The practice originated as a way for loggers to transport their lumber elsewhere, but gradually became the modern day practice.

Description
The practice involves standing upright on a bamboo pole as it drifts in a river. Practitioners then perform dance movements as they maintain their balance. The practice was described as ""water ballet"". As a competitive sport, participants use the pole as a means to race opponents.

History
Single-bamboo drifting originated as a way to travel in the Chishui River basin in the Chinese province of Guizhou. The practice is popular among the Miao people in the province, which had inhabited the Chishui river basin region, but has spread beyond the Miao cultural sphere, and is practiced by various ethnic groups in the region. 
Researchers led by Liang and Cheng state that the practice originated a thousand years ago as a way to transport bamboo logs by loggers inhabiting the mountainous and difficult to travel region, as bamboo was an ideal building material at the time. In order to stay caught up to the bamboo, the loggers would jump on the floating log, and the practice eventually became single-bamboo drifting. The rivers, which made the region difficult to travel through, were used by the loggers to travel throughout the otherwise difficult to travel region through the practice of single-bamboo drifting. Loggers would additionally carry a pike for the purposes of balancing.
According to Owen Fishwick at China Daily, the practice began in the Qin dynasty as a way to transport the valuable Nanmu wood logs produced in the Bozhou region via the Chishui River. Loggers would ride the logs to be loaded onto boats down the river to be sent to the ancient capital of Xianyang, as local boats could not fit the logs for transport elsewhere. The practice later changed from a necessity into a more casual activity in the Han dynasty. During the Qing dynasty, practitioners started using bamboo rather than wood logs, as bamboo was a cheaper and more accessible resource.

Modern practice
In modern times the practice has evolved into a performance art and a competitive sport, rather than a necessary means of travel. The practice of single-bamboo drifting has entered use within the National Traditional Games of Ethnic Minorities competition. The sport was introduced in the competition during the 9th national event, held in 2011. Practitioner Yang Liu gained a social media following in Mainland China through her combination of the practice with dance techniques and traditional dress.

Elements of national security,"National security has a number of component elements which, when individually satisfied, provide a nation with security of its values, interests and freedom to choose policy. These are listed differently by various authorities. Besides the military aspect of security, the aspects of politics, society, environment, energy and natural resources, and, economics are commonly listed. The elements of national security correlate closely to the concept of the elements of national power.

Choice of elements
As in the case of national power, the military aspect of security is an important, but not the sole, component of national security. To be truly secure, a nation needs other forms of security. Authorities differ in their choice of nation security elements.

Hospitallers Medical Battalion,"The Hospitallers (Ukrainian: Медичний батальйон «Госпітальєри», Hospitaliery) are a Ukrainian volunteer medical battalion that has been providing trauma care and evacuating wounded Ukrainian soldiers from the war zone in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war since 2014. Their slogan is ""For the sake of every life!"".
According to several media reports, by the end of 2018 Hospitallers had evacuated or treated up to 2750 Ukrainian soldiers, during the on-going Russo–Ukrainian war.

History
The Hospitallers Medical Battalion was founded on 6 July 2014, by medical volunteer Yana Zinkevych, who was 18 years old at the time. In a later interview Yana described how fierce battles for Ukrainian villages, Karlivka and Pisky, made her think of the necessity of a volunteer medical unit. 
The unit is named after Knights Hospitaller, a medieval Christian military order. In early 2016, it was taken under the auspices of the Volunteer Ukrainian Corps, a part of the Right Sector Organization.
When Dmytro Yarosh formed the Ukrainian Volunteer Army (UDA) in 2015, ""Hospitaliers"" became its structural division.
Yana Zinkevych is the chief of the Medical Service at Ukrainian Volunteer Army and the permanent commander of the Hospitallers Medical Battalion. As of March 2017, the Hospitallers consist of 60 persons (100 more in reserve).
In 2019 a municipal enterprise ""Hospitallers of Dnipro"" was created based on the Hospitallers Medical Battalion of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army. It received funding from the city budget of Dnipro.

Activity
The medical battalion provides assistance to all volunteers, military, and civilians in the war zone who need first aid, emergency medical intervention, or therapeutic treatment. Hospital crews evacuate, stabilize, and transport the wounded from the war zone to headquarters or frontline hospitals. 

Volunteers of the medical battalion provide constant support to the wounded in the city of Dnipro at the Mechnikov Hospital – a place where the majority of severely wounded people are transported. The Hospitallers also provide post-hospital support and rehabilitation for the wounded and their families.
The Hospitallers are operating in the war zone to provide assistance to the Ukrainian military, both volunteer units and the official Armed Forces. Representatives of the Hospitallers are positioned on the battlefield along with the Ukrainian military. This allows for providing more efficient and immediate assistance during a battle and increases the chances of successful evacuation and recovery of the wounded. There are also permanent positions in frontline hospitals, such as in Avdiivka city, where the Hospitallers provide support for the doctors of 66th Local Hospital.
Another important mission of the Hospitallers is medical and tactical training. They are conducted once a month during the period from early Spring to late Autumn.  
Training is held by experienced medical instructors who have been at the frontline themselves. Training is popular ",medicine
Long eighteenth century,"The long 18th century is a phrase used by many British historians to cover a more natural historical period than the simple use of the standard calendar definition. They expand the century to include larger British and Western European historical movements, with their subsequent ""long"" 18th century typically running from the Glorious Revolution and the beginning of the Nine Years' War in 1688 to the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Other definitions, perhaps those with a more social or global interest, extend the period further to, for example, from the Stuart Restoration in 1660 to the end of the Georgian era. Possibly the earliest proponent of the long eighteenth century was Sir John Robert Seeley, who in 1883 defined the eighteenth century as ""the period which begins with the Revolution of 1688 and ends with the peace of 1815"".
The Institute of Historical Research hosts a seminar series on ""British History in the Long 18th Century"".

Bean-to-bar,"Bean-to-bar is a business model in which a chocolate manufacturer controls the entire manufacturing process from procuring cocoa beans to creating the end product of consumer chocolate.

History
Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, some chocolate makers engaged in bean-to-bar manufacturing. They often used single-origin flavor cocoa and vintage equipment.

Introduction to bean-to-bar
The term ""bean-to-bar"" emerged from the artisan and craft chocolate movement around 2010. It is sometimes used interchangeably with the terms ""small batch chocolate"" and ""craft chocolate"". Several hundred small chocolate manufacturing companies were started to meet the demand for bean-to-bar products and a wider variety of flavors emerging from new consumer requirements. Bean-to-bar manufacturers take great care in selecting their cacao beans with many traveling to plantations in tropical regions to meet with growers in order to establish direct-trade relationships, some have managed to gain access to control the fermentation process. Over 2,500 bean-to-bar manufacturers have emerged around the world in less than 20 years. Entrepreneurs from  Australia, Canada, Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States with aptitudes for culinary arts, science, technology have all proven to be successful as chocolate makers.
All bean-to-bar chocolate makers process whole cocoa beans into a final product versus melting chocolate or starting with ground cocoa mass for use as a base, coating, filling or for mixing and molding into truffles, pralines, or other chocolate confectionery. One of the largest startups, the Mast Brothers, that was ""widely credited for introducing artisanal chocolate to mainstream American culture"" actually employed commercially produced chocolate from a third-party, making them better known as the creators of fake bean-to-bar chocolate in 2015. Big Chocolate has also been using the term to compete with the craft chocolate industry developed around the bean-to-bar concept.
As a result of the rise in consumer demand for fine and aromatic dark chocolate created by bean-to-bar (craft chocolate movement) and the idea of small batch recipes, new types of processing equipment and machinery have been developed facilitating small business development. Bean-to-bar chocolate makers are revolutionizing the world of chocolate leading to the development of many new legal marketing terms to better describe their products to match consumer demand and expectations. Schools and universities have developed classes and courses in bean-to-bar chocolate making and business development. New certifications, endorsements and labelling schemes based on ethical consumer values have also appeared. Big Chocolate has outright acquired several craft bean-to-bar operations.

Hardline,"In politics, hardline or hard-line is an adjective describing a stance on an issue that is inflexible and not subject to compromise. A hardliner is a person holding such views.  The stance is usually far from the centrist view. People, policies, and laws can be considered hardline. A hardliner may be either a reactionary or a revolutionary. Synonyms for hardliner include diehard, hawk, extremist, radical, fanatic, or zealot. The term is almost always relative to the Overton window of a given time and place.

Examples by country
France
The French government has taken a hardline stance against terrorism. France removed restrictions on raiding houses of suspected terrorists, although only five cases have been brought to court while over four thousand searches were conducted. Critics say the approach unfairly blames the Muslim community for radical extremists.

Ebrahim Raisi, a Shi'ite cleric and prominent politician, ran as a hardline challenger to President Rouhani in 2017 and was Rouhani's main challenger. He ran primarily on economic reforms and increasing distance with the West.
He later ran again for President in 2021 and won the election by 61.9% of the popular vote , succeeding Rouhani, who was term-limited.

Russia
After increased sanctions by Western countries, a poll from 2016 recorded that fifty-nine percent of Russians did not want their government to change its behavior. The respondents felt that either Westerns wanted to harm Russia, hold it to standards they did not live up to, or were simply ignorant of Russian reasoning for actions.

United Kingdom
Brexit is a hardline position on relations with the European Union. The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union to preserve its sovereignty, which was dubbed Brexit. After the vote, the two top searches on Google about the European Union were the implications of leaving the European Union and what ""EU"" (short for European Union) meant.

United States
One of the more common issues that uses hardline or hardliner as a description is illegal immigration. For example, the United States House of Representatives had two bills in June 2018 about immigration to consider: the hardline and centrist options. The House failed to pass the centrist bill. The House did not vote on the more extreme bill.

Words implying hardline stances
Hawk
A hawk is someone who prefers an extreme or aggressive stance, typically on war. However, the term hawk can also be used for other issues, like deficit spending. John McCain, an American senator and 2008 presidential nominee, was a considered a war hawk because of his policies on the Middle East. John R. Bolton, the national security advisor for President Trump, was also described as such.

Jacobean era,"The Jacobean era was the period in English and Scottish history that coincides 
with the reign of James VI of Scotland who also inherited the crown of England in 1603 as James I. The Jacobean era succeeds the Elizabethan era and precedes the Caroline era. The term ""Jacobean"" is often used for the distinctive styles of Jacobean architecture, visual arts, decorative arts, and literature which characterized that period.
The word ""Jacobean"" is derived from Neo-Latin Jacobaeus from Jacobus, the Ecclesiastical Latin form of the English name James.

James as King of England
The practical if not formal unification of England and Scotland under one ruler was an important shift of order for both nations, and would shape their existence to the present day. Another development of crucial significance was the foundation of the first British colonies on the North American continent; Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, Newfoundland in 1610, and Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1620, which laid the foundation for future British settlement and the eventual formation of both Canada and the United States of America. In 1609 the Parliament of Scotland began the Plantation of Ulster.
A notable event of James' reign occurred on 5 November 1605. On that date, a group of English Catholics (including Guy Fawkes) attempted to assassinate the King and destroy Parliament in the Palace of Westminster. However, the Gunpowder Plot was exposed and prevented, and the convicted plotters were hanged, drawn, and quartered.
Historians have long debated the curious characteristics of the king's ruling style. Croft says:

The pragmatism of 'little by little' was coming to characterise his style of governance. At the same time, the curious combination of ability and complacency, idleness and shrewd judgement, warm emotions and lack of discretion so well described by Fontenay remained typical of James throughout his life.

Royal finances
Political events and developments of the Jacobean era cannot be understood separately from the economic and financial situation. James was deeply in debt in Scotland, and after 1603 he inherited an English debt of £350,000 from Elizabeth. By 1608 the English debt had risen to £1,400,000 and was increasing by £140,000 annually. Through a crash program of selling off royal demesnes, Lord Treasurer Robert Cecil reduced the debt to £300,000 and the annual deficit to £46,000 by 1610—but could not follow the same method of relief much farther. The result was a series of tense and often failed negotiations with Parliament for financial supports, a situation that deteriorated over the reigns of James and his son and heir Charles I until the crisis of the English Civil War.
The Jacobean era ended with a severe economic depression in 1620–1626, complicated by a serious outbreak of bubonic plague in London in 1625.

Foreign policy
King James I was sincerely devoted to peace, not just for his three kingdoms but for Europe as a whole. He called himself ""Rex Pacificus"" (",history
Corn exchanges in England,"Corn exchanges are distinct buildings which were originally created as a venue for corn merchants to meet and arrange pricing with farmers for the sale of wheat, barley, and other corn crops. The word ""corn"" in British English denotes all cereal grains, such as wheat and barley. With the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, a large number of corn exchanges were built in England, particularly in the corn-growing areas of Eastern England.
However, with the fall in price of English corn as a result of cheap imports, corn exchanges mostly ceased to be built after the 1870s. Increasingly they were put to other uses, particularly as meeting and concert halls. Many found a new lease of life in the early 20th century as cinemas. Following the Second World War, many could not be maintained, and they were demolished. In the 1970s their architectural importance came to be appreciated, and most of the surviving examples are listed buildings. Most of the surviving corn exchanges have now been restored, and many have become arts centres, theatres, or concert halls.

Early corn exchanges
Corn exchanges were initially held as open markets normally controlled by the town or city authorities. Corn exchanges start appearing in the earlier part of the 18th century. At Bristol corn was sometimes traded at the Exchange Buildings in conjunction with other goods and produce. The Bristol Exchange was built to the designs of the Bath architect John Wood, the Elder in 1741–1743. Wood also designed the equally impressive exchange in Liverpool (which is now Liverpool Town Hall) in 1749–1754. In London the earliest covered corn exchange building was the London Corn Exchange built in Mark Lane in 1747. At Brighton, a corn exchange was built as part of the Brighton Dome.  Other corn exchanges followed with Wisbech (1811), Norwich (1828), Sheffield  (1830), Stowmarket  (1836), Bury St Edmunds (1837) and Cambridge (1842). Many of the early corn exchanges, such as Hadleigh and Winchester, were built round quadrangles where the trading took place, but the central area was roofed over at a later date.

After the repeal of the Corn Laws
It was the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 which led to an explosion in corn exchange building. This also coincided with the boom in railway building, resulting in the easier transportation of corn. In some towns the corn exchanges were built by the civic authorities but in others speculative Market Companies were set up to promote the trading of corn.  Considerable civic and commercial rivalry ensued and in the small market town of Market Rasen in Lincolnshire two corn exchanges were built in 1854. As these corn exchanges were rarely operating for more than two hours in a week, the buildings would be let out for many other purposes including public meetings concerts and dances. With the Great Depression of British Agriculture, which occurred from about 1873 to 1893, the building of new corn exchanges had largely ceased by 1880. The building of new exchan",economics
Neurosurgery in Sri Lanka,"Neurosurgery in Sri Lanka

Origin
Shelton Cabraal, FRCS is known as the father of neurosurgery in Sri Lanka. In 1956 he formed the first organised neurosurgery unit in the country. The unit was located in the General Hospital Colombo (present National Hospital of Sri Lanka). It is said that this unit was an up-to-date unit at the time. It even had the facility to perform skull base surgery, which was a novelty at that time. Most of the ""first neurosurgery operation in the country""  were performed here.

Associations
Fifty years later in 2006, Neurosurgeons Association of Sri Lanka was formed under the leadership of Jaliya Lokuketagoda. Other leading neurosurgeons who contributed to this task were Deepal Attanayake, Fred Perera, S.C.Abeysuriya, Prasanna Gunasena, Ranjith Wickramasinghe, Saman Wadanamby, Jayantha Liyanage, Himashi Kularatne, Arul Kanagarajan, T. Rajakaruna, Nishantha Gunasekara and Sunil Perera . S C Abeysooriya was elected the first president.

Technological contributions
First ever operative neurosurgery contribution from Sri Lanka to the world surfaced in 2012. It was a combination of open craniotomy and stereotaxy which is used to treat intraventricular hemorrhage and the technique was designed by Jaliya Lokuketagoda.

Neurosurgeon training and certification
Sri Lanka has just over 20 consultant neurosurgeons for over 20 million people. The country produces its own neurosurgeons through a seven-year rigorous training process. The training includes a mandatory training segment that has to be completed in Sri Lanka and another mandatory training segment which has to be completed in a reputed neurosurgery center in England or in Australia. This way Sri Lanka manages to offer a high level of care to its neurosurgery patients. The Postgraduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) of University of Colombo is the responsible body for training and certifying neurosurgeons. The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) maintains a list of Consultant Specialists of the country including neurosurgeons. If a non-Sri Lankan neurosurgeon wishes to practice in the country a temporary medical licence should be obtained from the SLMC.

Patient care
The Sri Lankan population is served by two systems. In the private healthcare system, the patient has to pay, and in the public healthcare system, healthcare is free. Both systems offer reasonably good neurosurgery service to the population. However, most modern neurosurgery facilities are only available in major cities like Colombo. The government neurosurgical centers are situated in Colombo, Sri Jayawardenepura, Kandy, Karapititya (Galle), Jaffna, Batticalo and Badulla. The Colombo center, which is affiliated to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka is the best equipped and well staffed unit. All the private neurosurgical units are located in Colombo. They are affiliated to the private hospitals; Nawaloka hospital, Asiri Group (Central hospital) and Lanka hospital. Central hospital has the leading neurosurgery divisi",medicine
Bouldering,"Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. While bouldering can be done without any equipment, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and to provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the sequence of moves that a climber performs to complete the climb) are usually less than six metres (20 ft) tall. Traverses, which are a form of boulder problem, require the climber to climb horizontally from one end to another. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to climb indoors in areas without natural boulders. In addition, bouldering competitions take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.
The sport was originally a method of training for roped climbs and mountaineering, so climbers could practice specific moves at a safe distance from the ground. Additionally, the sport served to build stamina and increase finger strength. Throughout the 20th century, bouldering evolved into a separate discipline. Individual problems are assigned ratings based on difficulty. Although there have been various rating systems used throughout the history of bouldering, modern problems usually use either the V-scale or the Fontainebleau scale.

Outdoor bouldering
The characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on the type of rock being climbed. For example, granite often features long cracks and slabs while sandstone rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks. Limestone and volcanic rock are also used for bouldering.
There are many prominent bouldering areas throughout the United States, including Hueco Tanks in Texas, Mount Blue Sky in Colorado, The Appalachian Mountains in The Eastern United States, and The Buttermilks in Bishop, California. Squamish, British Columbia is one of the most popular bouldering areas in Canada. Europe is also home to a number of bouldering sites, such as Fontainebleau in France, Meschia in Italy, Albarracín in Spain, and various mountains throughout Switzerland.

Indoor bouldering
Artificial climbing walls are used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. Some problems use steep overhanging surfaces which force the climber to support much of their weight using their upper body strength.
Climbing gyms often feature multiple problems within the same section of wall. Historically, the most common method route-setters used to designate the intended problem was by placing colored tape next to each hold. For example, red tape would indicate one bouldering problem while green tape would be used to set",sports
Mobilities,"Mobilities is a contemporary paradigm in the social sciences that explores the movement of people (human migration, individual mobility, travel, transport), ideas (see e.g. meme) and things (transport), as well as the broader social implications of those movements. Mobility can also be thought as the movement of people through social classes, social mobility or income, income mobility. 
A mobility ""turn"" (or transformation) in the social sciences began in the 1990s in response to the increasing realization of the historic and contemporary importance of movement on individuals and society. This turn has been driven by generally increased levels of mobility and new forms of mobility where bodies combine with information and different patterns of mobility. The mobilities paradigm incorporates new ways of theorizing about how these mobilities lie ""at the center of constellations of power, the creation of identities and the microgeographies of everyday life."" (Cresswell, 2011, 551)
The mobility turn arose as a response to the way in which the social sciences had traditionally been static, seeing movement as a black box and ignoring or trivializing ""the importance of the systematic movements of people for work and family life, for leisure and pleasure, and for politics and protest"" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 208). Mobilities emerged as a critique of contradictory orientations toward both sedentarism and deterritorialisation in social science. People had often been seen as static entities tied to specific places, or as nomadic and placeless in a frenetic and globalized existence. Mobilities looks at movements and the forces that drive, constrain and are produced by those movements.
Several typologies have been formulated to clarify the wide variety of mobilities. Most notably, John Urry divides mobilities into five types: mobility of objects, corporeal mobility, imaginative mobility, virtual mobility and communicative mobility. Later, Leopoldina Fortunati and Sakari Taipale proposed an alternative typology taking the individual and the human body as a point of reference. They differentiate between ‘macro-mobilities’ (consistent physical displacements), ‘micro-mobilities’ (small-scale displacements), ‘media mobility’ (mobility added to the traditionally fixed forms of media) and ‘disembodied mobility’ (the transformation in the social order). The categories are typically considered interrelated, and therefore they are not exclusive.

Scope
While mobilities is commonly associated with sociology, contributions to the mobilities literature have come from scholars in anthropology, cultural studies, economics, geography, migration studies, science and technology studies, and tourism and transport studies. (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 207)
The eponymous journal Mobilities provides a list of typical subjects which have been explored in the mobilities paradigm (Taylor and Francis, 2011):

Frank Spooner Churchill,"Frank Spooner Churchill (August 26, 1864 – February 27, 1946) was an American paediatrician who took a special interest in infant feeding. A graduate of Harvard University, as a paediatrician Churchill took a particular interest in public health, early child health and in breastfeeding. Much of his research centered around the untoward effects of lack of breast milk or inadequate modified milk.
He became the chief editor of the American Journal of Diseases of Children and the president of the American Pediatric Society. After the First World War, he went on to hold senior positions with a number of child health boards and organisations.

Early life
Frank Spooner Churchill was born on August 26, 1864, in Milton, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University with an AB in 1886, before receiving his MD in 1890.

Career
Churchill's hospital appointments included attending paediatrician at the Cook County Hospital and Presbyterian Hospital and president of the medical staff at Children's Memorial Hospital from 1909–1917. He was also an associate professor of paediatrics at Rush Medical College. In 1912, he was resident physician to the American Geographic Society of New York's expedition to the west coast.
Between 1911 and 1919 he was chief editor of the American Journal of Diseases of Children, and in 1916–17 was president of the American Pediatric Society.
He left his position at Children's Memorial Hospital in 1917 to serve as a major in the United States Army during the First World War. After the war he became more involved in public health. He held senior positions with Chicago Board of Health, the Chicago Milk Commission, the Infant Welfare Society of Chicago and the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute.

Breastfeeding
Churchill established the first infant's clinic at Children's Memorial Hospital and was an advocate of breast feeding but believed that the milk could be spoiled if it was taken at the wrong frequency or if the mother was nervous or anxious, rendering her ""utterly unfit to serve the purpose of a cow"". Also an advocate of modified cow's milk (formula milk), he concluded that modified milk could only be afforded by an elite few but was beneficial as it was more closer to breast milk than the alternatives.
His 1896 study, ""Infant Feeding"", gave a number of case studies of infant feeding and the progress of the child and asked what was the best food for infants in the first year of life? Churchill stated categorically that ""there can be and is but one answer, average breast milk"". In the 1910s, he advocated the employment of wet nurses by hospitals.

Further paediatric work
In 1912, Churchill demonstrated, using the Wassermann test, the underestimated existence of congenital syphilis in Chicago hospitals.
Before the Second World War, he invited into his home Jewish psychiatrists from Germany and Austria who had an interest in childhood development and were refugees from the Nazis. He asked the U.S. government to establish guidance cl",medicine
Cultural economics,"Cultural economics is the branch of economics that studies the relation of culture to economic outcomes. Here, 'culture' is defined by shared beliefs and preferences of respective groups. Programmatic issues include whether and how much culture matters as to economic outcomes and what its relation is to institutions. As a growing field in behavioral economics, the role of culture in economic behavior is increasingly being demonstrated to cause significant differentials in decision-making and the management and valuation of assets.

Overview
Applications include the study of religion, social capital, social norms, social identity, fertility, beliefs in redistributive justice, ideology, hatred, terrorism, trust, family ties, long-term orientation, and the culture of economics.  A general analytical theme is how ideas and behaviors are spread among individuals through the formation of social capital, social networks and processes such as social learning, as in the theory of social evolution  and information cascades. Methods include case studies and theoretical and empirical modeling of cultural transmission within and across social groups. In 2013, Said E. Dawlabani added the value systems approach to the cultural emergence aspect of macroeconomics.

Development
Cultural economics develops from how wants and tastes are formed in society. This is partly due to nurture aspects, or what type of environment one is raised in, as it is the internalization of one's upbringing that shapes their future wants and tastes. Acquired tastes can be thought of as an example of this, as they demonstrate how preferences can be shaped socially.
A key thought area that separates the development of cultural economics from traditional economics is a difference in how individuals arrive at their decisions. While a traditional economist will view decision making as having both implicit and explicit consequences, a cultural economist would argue that an individual will not only arrive at their decision based on these implicit and explicit decisions but based on trajectories. These trajectories consist of regularities, which have been built up throughout the years and guide individuals in their decision-making process.

Combining value systems and systems thinking
Economists have also started to look at cultural economics with a systems thinking approach. In this approach, the economy and culture are each viewed as a single system where ""interaction and feedback effects were acknowledged, and where in particular the dynamic were made explicit"". In this sense, the interdependencies of culture and the economy can be combined and better understood by following this approach.
Said E. Dawlabani's book MEMEnomics: The Next-Generation Economic System combines the ideas of value systems (see value (ethics)) and systems thinking to provide one of the first frameworks that explores the effect of economic policies on culture. The book explores the intersections of multiple disciplines",economics

Food system,"The term food system describes the interconnected systems and processes that influence nutrition, food, health, community development, and agriculture. A food system includes all processes and infrastructure involved in feeding a population: growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, distribution, and disposal of food and food-related items. It also includes the inputs needed and outputs generated at each of these steps.
Food systems fall within agri-food systems, which encompass the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-adding activities in the primary production of food and non-food agricultural products, as well as in food storage, aggregation, post-harvest handling, transportation, processing, distribution, marketing, disposal, and consumption. A food system operates within and is influenced by social, political, economic, technological and environmental contexts. It also requires human resources that provide labor, research and education. Food systems are either conventional or alternative according to their model of food lifespan from origin to plate. Food systems are dependent on a multitude of ecosystem services. For example, natural pest regulations, microorganisms providing nitrogen-fixation, and pollinators.
According to the IPCC, the global food system, including all of the various industries involved in sustainable and conventional food systems, provide employment for 1 billion people. This global food system is facing a number of challenges created by impeding global food security issues created by climate change and non-climate change stresses on the system. About 34% of total greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the global food system. In 2020 an EU evidence review found that food system gas emissions are on course to increase by 30–40% by 2050 due to population growth and dietary change. It is crucial to build the resilience of agrifood systems so that they have the capacity over time, in the face of any disruption, to sustainably ensure availability of and access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food for all, and sustain the livelihoods of agrifood systems' actors.
Transitioning to sustainable food systems is critical for addressing global challenges such as climate change, hunger, biodiversity loss, and deforestation. Addressing issues at each stage in the system, can have system-wide effects for 30-40 percent of food produced is lost from post-harvest up to retail and the consumer. Reducing food waste then reduces the environmental impacts of agriculture, such as land use impacts, and reducing food prices or preventing shortages. International policy has increasingly approached policy from a food systems perspective: Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger and Sustainable Development Goal 12: ""responsible consumption and production"" focus on sustainable food systems and Sustainable and in September 2021 the United Nations hosted the first Food Systems Summit.

Centre-right politics,"Centre-right politics is the set of right-wing political ideologies that lean closer to the political centre. It is commonly associated with conservatism, Christian democracy, liberal conservatism, and conservative liberalism. Conservative and liberal centre-right political parties have historically performed better in elections in the Anglosphere than other centre-right parties, while Christian democracy has been the primary centre-right ideology in Europe.
The centre-right commonly supports ideas such as small government, law and order, freedom of religion, and strong national security. It has historically stood in opposition to radical politics, redistributive policies, multiculturalism, immigration, and LGBT acceptance. Economically, the centre-right supports free markets and the social market economy, with market liberalism and neoliberalism being common centre-right economic positions. It typically seeks to preserve the cultural and socioeconomic status quo and believes that changes should be implemented gradually.
The centre-right is derived from the left–right political spectrum of the French Revolution. It first developed as a political force with the creation of party systems in the 19th century, when monarchist and religious conservatives competed with individualist and anti-clerical liberals. Christian democracy developed in the 1870s as another response to anti-clericalism. The centre-right provided a moderate position to compete with socialism in the 19th century, and it became a driving force for liberal democracy in the early 20th century.
The centre-right was reconfigured after World War II to temper support for nationalism; it became a dominant political position throughout the Western world, particularly with the spread of Christian democracy across Europe. It aligned with the Western bloc during the Cold War, and in Europe it heavily influenced democratic consolidation and European integration. Global economic downturn in the 1970s caused a rise in support for neoliberalism and neoconservatism. The dissolution of the Soviet Union allowed a new centre-right movement to develop and take power in Central and Eastern Europe through the 1990s. The 2007–2008 financial crisis led to declining support for the centre-right, and the following decade saw it replaced by greater support for far-right politics.

Ideologies
The centre-right is heterogeneous and encompasses multiple distinct ideologies. Centre-right parties and coalitions are traditionally understood to be divided into separate factions depending on their priorities: economic, social, and cultural. They are unified by their opposition to left-wing politics.
Christian democracy is a political ideology predominant in Europe that is often described as centre-right. It applies Christian morality to political issues, giving a religious justification for supporting democratisation, individual liberties, and international cooperation. Christian democrats hold conservative positions ",politics
Ice cricket,"Ice cricket is a variant of the English summer game of cricket but played in harsh, wintry conditions. Early forms of ice cricket were played outdoors and on skates. The difference between the forms of ice cricket is that some are played directly on the ice, with no mat laid down . In modern forms the players don't wear skates.
In the modern game the ball is the same as an indoor cricket ball, a composite plastic red ball which makes it relatively easy to find if it gets hit into a snowdrift.
The Ice Cricket World Championship is held annually in the Estonian city of Tallinn. With winter temperatures of minus 10 to minus 25 degree Celsius, the tournaments are played on Harku Lake, which freezes over rapidly in early January.

History
Cricket on ice was played in England from at least the first half of the 19th century.
A game was played in Sheffield in 1826.  A match was played on the ice near Sheffield a few days ago, in skates, in which several of the Sheffield Club were engaged. Through one of the bats breaking the double wickets were struck, and the day was concluded with a well contested single wicket game.
Cricket Match Extraordinary.— The splendid piece of water on Erridge Park has been a grand scene of attraction for the last few weeks to the visitors and inhabitants of Tonbridge Wells. The surface covers an area of about twenty-one acres, and consequently gives a fine opportunity for scientific skating. We have noticed as many as from 100 to 200 at a time forming various figures on the ice. A cricket match was played on the ice by Messrs. E. Vanx, 33; J. Clapson, 1; T. Russell, 29; Duffy, 9, not out; A, Glover, 0; W.Loof, 1; J. J. Hastings and W. Friend; byes, 12; total 85; against —T.Neal, 14; J. Trice, 16; R. Clapson, 1; J. Taylor, 17; T.Seamer, 7; G.Bourne, 10, Beale.0; and J.Gurr, 12; byes, 17; total,84. The bowling of Mr. J. Clapson excited general admiration, as well as that of Messrs. Vaux and Seamer. The stumps were fixed in two blocks of wood, and all the gentlemen played in skates; the ball when struck flew with great swiftness over the ice, the parties running or rather skating between the wickets, and those who were looking out skating after the ball. The whole presented a most lively and interesting scene. The latter evolutions were attended with many of those minor accidents peculiar to the slippery game, much to the amusement of the numerous spectators; we are happy, however, to say that none were materially hurt. The game was a single innings. Mr. Vaux obtained thirty-three runs and was not out; his batting was very superior, as was also that of Mr. Thomas Neal. There were upwards of a hundred ladies and gentlemen on the ice at one time, among whom we noticed the Right Hon. Lord Viscount Nevile, Miss Myeta, &c. — Kentish Observer

Generic medicine in India,"Generic medicine in India refers to pharmaceuticals that are sold under their chemical name rather than a specific brand name. These medications contain the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, quality, and intended use as their brand-name counterparts but are typically sold at significantly lower prices. The Indian generic medicine market has risen to international prominence due to the country's ability to produce affordable, high-quality medications, particularly following the 1970 Patent Act which permitted domestic companies to manufacture drugs using alternative processes. This has enabled India to become one of the world's leading suppliers of generic medicines, currently providing approximately 20% of the global supply and 40% of the generic drugs consumed in the United States.
The significance of generic medicines in India is further emphasized by government initiatives aimed at increasing affordability and accessibility.  Key initiatives include the Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP), launched in 2016, which aims to provide affordable, high-quality generics to all citizens, with a particular focus on marginalized groups. The Jan Aushadhi initiative, started in 2008, has established a network of retail outlets, known as Jan Aushadhi Kendras, that exclusively sell generic medications, thereby improving public access to essential medicines. Despite these efforts, the promotion of generic medicines faces challenges such as public perception issues, concerns about quality assurance, and economic barriers, especially affecting access in rural areas.
As the Indian generic pharmaceutical sector continues to expand, ongoing government support and public health campaigns are critical to addressing these challenges and enhancing healthcare outcomes. Increasing awareness and promoting the endorsement of generic medicines by healthcare professionals are necessary to dispel misconceptions regarding their efficacy and quality. Regulatory reforms are also essential to ensure stringent standards of safety and effectiveness. Ultimately, generic medicines play a vital role in the Indian healthcare system by offering substantial economic benefits and improving health equity across the nation.

History of Generic Medicines in India
The history of generic medicines in India can be traced back to the post-independence era in 1947, when the pharmaceutical market was primarily dominated by foreign companies, which held over 90% of the market share. A significant turning point occurred in 1970 with the enactment of the Patents Act, 1970, which, while not allowing the patenting of medical products, permitted the patenting of processes. This pivotal legislation empowered Indian pharmaceutical companies to manufacture drugs using alternative processes, leading to the rise of reverse engineering and significantly impacting the generic drug market.

Ballon au poing,"The ballon au poing is a popular team sport in Picardy (France). This game is played by teams of six. It is a game of gain-ground.
This sport must not be confused with the fistball.
To be able to hit the ball, players surround their hand and their wrist with a strip of canvas or leather.

The teams are separated on the ground by a line ( la corde - the rope) which is mobile during the party. This new limit is shown by a chasse.
The purpose of the game is to gain ground by moving the rope. To do it, we try to make the ball ""die"" in the opposite camp.
Points mark by 15, 30, 40 and game.
Each 15 August at the Parc de la Hotoie ( Amiens ), the city receives the final stages of Ballon au poing.

Camarilla,"A camarilla is a group of courtiers or favourites who surround a king or ruler. Usually, they do not hold any office or have any official authority at the royal court but influence their ruler behind the scenes. Consequently, they also escape having to bear responsibility for the effects of their advice. The term derives from the Spanish word camarilla (diminutive of cámara), meaning 'little chamber' or private cabinet of the king. It was first used of the circle of cronies around Spanish King Ferdinand VII (reigned 1814–1833). The term involves what is known as cronyism. The term also entered other languages like Polish, German and Greek, and is used in the sense given above.
A similar concept in modern politics is that of a Kitchen Cabinet, which is often composed of unelected advisers bypassing traditional governance practices.

Late antiquity,"Late antiquity is sometimes defined as spanning from the end of classical antiquity to the local start of the Middle Ages, from around the late 3rd century up to the 7th or 8th century in Europe and adjacent areas bordering the Mediterranean Basin depending on location. The popularisation of this periodization in English has generally been credited to historian Peter Brown, who proposed a period between 150 and 750 AD. The Oxford Centre for Late Antiquity defines it as ""the period between approximately 250 and 750 AD"". Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate. In the West, its end was earlier, with the start of the Early Middle Ages typically placed in the 6th century, or even earlier on the edges of the Western Roman Empire.

Terminology
The term Spätantike, literally ""late antiquity"", has been used by German-speaking historians since its popularization by Alois Riegl in the early 20th century. It was given currency in English partly by the writings of Peter Brown, whose survey The World of Late Antiquity (1971) revised the Gibbon view of a stale and ossified Classical culture, in favour of a vibrant time of renewals and beginnings, and whose The Making of Late Antiquity offered a new paradigm of understanding the changes in Western culture of the time in order to confront Sir Richard Southern's The Making of the Middle Ages.
The continuities between the later Roman Empire, as it was reorganized by Diocletian (r. 284–305), and the Early Middle Ages are stressed by writers who wish to emphasize that the seeds of medieval culture were already developing in the Christianized empire, and that they continued to do so in the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire at least until the coming of Islam. Concurrently, some migrating Germanic tribes such as the Ostrogoths and Visigoths saw themselves as perpetuating the ""Roman"" tradition. While the usage ""Late Antiquity"" suggests that the social and cultural priorities of classical antiquity endured throughout Europe into the Middle Ages, the usage of ""Early Middle Ages"" or ""Early Byzantine"" emphasizes a break with the classical past, and the term ""Migration Period"" tends to de-emphasize the disruptions in the former Western Roman Empire caused by the creation of Germanic kingdoms within her borders beginning with the foedus with the Goths in Aquitania in 418.
The general decline of population, technological knowledge and standards of living in Europe during this period became the archetypal example of societal collapse for writers from the Renaissance. As a result of this decline, and the relative scarcity of historical records from Europe in particular, the period from roughly the early fifth century until the Carolingian Renaissance (or later still) was referred to as the ""Dark Ages"". This term has mostly been abandoned as a name for a historiographical epoch, being replaced by ""Late Antiquity"" in the periodization of the late Western Roman Empire, the early Byzantine Empire a",history
Brilliant Labs,"Brilliant Labs is a Singapore-based technology company that produces open source eyewear featuring artificial intelligence (AI).
Brilliant Labs was founded in 2019 in Hong Kong by Bobak Tavangar, a former Apple program lead. Tavangar said he saw the potential for integrating the capabilities of artificial intelligence into glasses to give consumers ""visual superpowers."" The goal was to use an open source platform for development that would allow for creators to access the company's code and create new apps for devices.
In January 2024, the company introduced its first product, Frame, which were glasses that looked similar to those worn by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. They were designed to be indistinguishable from regular eyeglasses and would be worn by those who wore prescription lenses. The glasses were enabled for audio with a voice assistant called Noa and featured an AI search engine called Perplexity. They came at a time when other companies introduced similar products, like AI Pin from Humane, R1 from Rabbit, or Vision Pro from Apple, and came after other products, like Google Glass or HoloLens from Microsoft did not gain traction. Prior to this, the company offered the Monocle, an augmented reality (AR) lens that attached to traditional glasses, and which also used open source software.

Agricultural economics,"Agricultural economics is an applied field of economics concerned with the application of economic theory in optimizing the production and distribution of food and fiber products. 
Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics that specifically dealt with land usage. It focused on maximizing the crop yield while maintaining a good soil ecosystem.  Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much broader.  Agricultural economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with conventional economics. Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in economics, econometrics, development economics, and environmental economics.  Agricultural economics influences food policy, agricultural policy, and environmental policy.

Origins
Economics has been defined as the study of resource allocation under scarcity. Agricultural economics, or the application of economic methods to optimize the decisions made by agricultural producers, grew to prominence around the turn of the 20th century.  The field of agricultural economics can be traced back to works on land economics. Henry Charles Taylor was the greatest contributor in this period, with the establishment of the Department of Agricultural Economics at the University of Wisconsin in 1909.
Another contributor, 1979 Nobel Economics Prize winner Theodore Schultz, was among the first to examine development economics as a problem related directly to agriculture. Schultz was also instrumental in establishing econometrics as a tool for use in analyzing agricultural economics empirically; he noted in his landmark 1956 article that agricultural supply analysis is rooted in ""shifting sand"", implying that it was and is simply not being done correctly.
One scholar in the field, Ford Runge, summarizes the development of agricultural economics as follows:

Agricultural economics arose in the late 19th century, combined the theory of the firm with marketing and organization theory, and developed throughout the 20th century largely as an empirical branch of general economics.  The discipline was closely linked to empirical applications of mathematical statistics and made early and significant contributions to econometric methods.  In the 1960s and afterwards, as agricultural sectors in the OECD countries contracted, agricultural economists were drawn to the development problems of poor countries, to the trade and macroeconomic policy implications of agriculture in rich countries, and to a variety of production, consumption, and environmental and resource problems.
Agricultural economists have made many well-known contributions to the economics field with such models as the cobweb model, hedonic regression pricing models, new technology and diffusion models (Zvi Griliches),  multifactor productivity and efficiency theory and measurement, and the random coefficients regression. The farm sector is frequently cited a",economics
Independent conservative,"Independent Conservative is a description which has been used in the United Kingdom, Canada, United States and elsewhere, to denote a political conservative who lacks a formal affiliation to the party of that name.

In the United Kingdom
As a description for use on the ballot paper, until 1999 anyone could stand at any British election as an Independent Conservative, but since the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 came into force, a candidate who is not officially certified by the Conservative Party must either stand for another registered political party or as an Independent. However, the term is still used to designate a politician who either has left the Conservative Party or never joined it, so is independent of it, but who nevertheless identifies as a conservative.
Lord Robert Cecil was an Independent Conservative in the House of Commons between 1911 and 1923, after he won the 1911 by-election for Hitchin, Hertfordshire. At the 1945 general election, John Mackie and Daniel Lipson were both elected to the Commons as Independent Conservatives.
Andrew Hunter was elected as a Conservative MP in 2001; he left the party when selected in 2002 as a candidate for the Democratic Unionist Party in the 2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election. Hunter sat as an Independent Conservative MP until joining the DUP Westminster parliamentary party in 2004.
Lord Stevens of Ludgate sat in the House of Lords as an Independent Conservative between 2004 and 2012. Derek Conway sat as an Independent Conservative after he lost the whip in 2008, and did not contest the 2010 general election.
Nadine Dorries was suspended from the Conservative Party after taking part in the television competition I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in November 2012, before regaining the Conservative whip in May 2013.
On 25 October 2016, Zac Goldsmith resigned from the House of Commons over the planned expansion of Heathrow Airport, triggering a by-election, which Goldsmith contested as an Independent, but without opposition from the Conservative Party. He was described as an Independent Conservative.
In April 2019, Nick Boles quit the Conservatives to sit as what he called an ""Independent Progressive Conservative"".
In September 2019, Amber Rudd quit the Conservatives over the disagreement that has been engaged in by their former 21 MP colleagues on the subject of Brexit, under Boris Johnson leadership. She decided not to seek re-election at the 2019 general election after initially planning to run as an Independent Conservative.

In Canada
Independent Conservative members of parliament have also sat in the House of Commons of Canada, with a similar designation. In the 19th century, prior to the solidification of the party system, it was common in Canada for Independent Conservative and Independent Liberal members to be elected, sometimes defeating official Conservative or Liberal candidates.

Woggabaliri,"Woggabaliri is a traditional Indigenous Australian co-operative kicking volley game. Described as a kicking game similar to soccer played in a group of four to six players in a circle, the game has been encouraged in schools in New South Wales and Queensland.

Origin
Ken Edwards research
In 1999 Australian author Ken Edwards, then Associate Professor in Sport, Health and Physical Education at the Queensland University of Technology, published a book Choopadoo: Games from the Dreamtime, in which he makes mention of a game played by the Wiradjuri children near the Bogan River and Lachlan River. Historian David Thompson while investigating Aboriginal games, alleges that Edwards simply coined the term using an existing Aboriginal word and attributed it to various observations across outback Victoria and New South Wales. Ken Edwards and Troy Meston stated that the word Woggabaliri comes from the Wiradjuri word for ""play"". However according to the official Wiradjuri dictionary (as researched by Dr Stan Grant and Dr John Rudder) the word for play is wagigi. Robert Hamilton Mathews, studying Aboriginal Australian languages, listed the word woggabaliri in 1901 as the Ngunnawal word for ""play"". 
The Australian Sports Commission (ASC) in 2000 cited permission to ""use and adapt"" Edwards' Choopadoo book to publish a derivative titled Indigenous Traditional Games, listing it as one of 19 games complete with lists of rules. The ASC's John Evans copied the descriptions of the games verbatim from Edwards' book, though further modified Woggabaliri with additional rules to make it suitable for contemporary children to play. Indigenous Traditional Games has subsequently been cited as a source for Woggabaliri by others, such as English-Australian fantasy author Malcom Walker.

Funding and grants based on Woggabaliri
In 2002 the ASC also funded the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to promote Woggabaliri to schools as part of the Indigenous Sports program (ISC).

In 2007 Dr Patrick Greene, CEO of Museums Victoria, discovered Gustav Mützel's 1862 engravings of findings from the Blandowski expedition, including a depiction of Jarijari in 1857, observed at Mondellimin (now Merbein, Victoria). In the background of this engraving a child can be seen kicking the ""ball"" with others attempting to catch it, the caption translated from German reads ""A group of children is playing with a ball. The ball is made out of typha roots (roots of the bulrush). It is not thrown or hit with a bat, but is kicked up in the air with a foot. The aim of the game - never let the ball touch the ground"".
In 2010 Football Federation Australia (FFA) in its Australian 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, connected the Australian Sports Commission's Edwards-based game to Mützel's image and cited the similarity to football (soccer) as evidence that football (soccer) had a history in Australia stretching back thousands of years.

Peace economics,"Peace economics is a branch of conflict economics and focuses on the design of the sociosphere's political, economic, and cultural institutions and their interacting policies and actions with the goal of preventing, mitigating, or resolving violent conflict within and between societies. This violent conflict could be of any type and could involve either latent or actual violence. Recognizing the cost of violence, peace economics focuses on the benefits of (re)constructing societies with a view toward achieving irreversible, stable peace. Along with approaches drawn from other areas of scholarship, peace economics forms part of peace science, an evolving part of peace and conflict studies.
Despite overlaps, peace economics is distinct from war, military, defense, and security economics, all of which are branches of conflict economics. A key difference between peace economics and these related fields is that peace economics emphasizes the study of the presence of or conditions for peace, as distinct from studying the absence or presence of conflict, violence, war, or insecurity.
History of economic theories of peace
Peace economics has also been defined as ""the use of economics to understand the causes and effects of violent conflict in the international system and the ways that conflict can be avoided, managed, or resolved."" This restricts the subject matter to the international realm and leaves out the study of peace itself. Walter Isard defines peace economics as ""generally concerned with: (1) resolution, management or reduction of conflict in the economic sphere, or among behaving units in their economic activity; (2) the use of economic measures and policy to cope with and control conflicts whether economic or not; and (3) the impact of conflict on the economic behavior and welfare of firms, consumers organizations, government and society."" The notion of violence is absent and peace itself is not studied, but the level of analysis can be other than conflict between states. In a context restricted to international trade, another author writes that ""Peace economics studies ways to eradicate and control conflict as well as to assess conflict's impact on society."" The notion of violence is not explicit and the benefits of peace are seen only inasmuch as a reduction of conflict may improve opportunities for expanded global trade. Others make a distinction between ""productive"" and ""unproductive"" or ""appropriative"" economic activities their starting point of analysis in peace economics.
Economics Nobelist Jan Tinbergen defines peace economics as ""economic science used for [a purpose that] prohibits [war] as an instrument of settling conflicts between nations and [to organize] the world in a way that warfare is punished"". Violence is addressed only at the level of sovereigns, not dealing with civil war or debilitating organized or individual-level criminal violence. In related work, Tinbergen writes about a world order that would inhibit violence and ",economics
Crop insurance,"Crop insurance is insurance purchased by agricultural producers and subsidized by a country's government to protect against either the loss of their crops due to natural disasters, such as hail, drought, and floods (""crop-yield insurance""), or the loss of revenue due to declines in the prices of agricultural commodities (""crop-revenue insurance"").

United States
In the United States, the federal government subsidizes an average of 62 percent of the premium. In 2019, crop insurance policies covered almost 380 million acres. Major crops are insurable in most counties where they are grown, and about 90% of U.S. crop acreage is insured under the federal crop insurance program. Four crops—corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat—typically account for more than 70% of total enrolled acres. For these major crops, a large share of plantings is covered by crop insurance.
In the United States, a subsidized multi-peril federal insurance program, administered by the Risk Management Agency, is available to most farmers. The program is authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act (which is actually title V of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, P.L. 75-430), as amended. Federal crop insurance is available for more than 100 different crops, although not all insurable crops are covered in every county. With the amendments to the Federal Crop Insurance Act made by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-354, Title I) and the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-224), USDA is authorized to offer basically free catastrophic (CAT) coverage to producers who grow an insurable crop. For a premium, farmers can buy additional coverage beyond the CAT level. Crops for which insurance is not available are protected under the Noninsured Assistance Program (NAP). Federal crop insurance is sold and serviced through private insurance companies. A portion of the premium, as well as the administrative and operating expenses of the private companies, is subsidized by the federal government. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation reinsures the companies by absorbing some of the losses of the program when indemnities exceed total premiums. Several revenue insurance products are available on major crops as a form of additional coverage.

History of crop insurance in the U.S.
In 1938, Congress passed the Federal Crop Insurance Act, which established the first Federal Crop Insurance Program. These early efforts were not particularly successful due to
high program costs and low participation rates among farmers. The program had difficulty amassing sufficient reserves to pay claims and was not financially viable.
In 1980, Congress passed legislation to increase participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program and make it more affordable and accessible. This modern era of crop insurance was marked by the introduction of a public-private partnership between the U.S. government and private insurance companies.

Garcia v. Vilsack,"Garcia v. Vilsack refers to a 2000 lawsuit brought by a hundred Hispanic farmers against the USDA, with the farmers claiming the organization had discriminated against Latino/Hispanic farmers.  This lawsuit was filed at the US District Court for the District of Columbia.
The lawsuit is often recognized in conjunction with other group lawsuits filed against the USDA which include: Pigford v. Glickman (filed by African American farmers), Keepseagle v. Vilsack (filed by Native American farmers), and Love v. Vilsack (filed by female farmers). The lawsuit claimed that the USDA discriminated against Hispanic/Latino farmers in credit transactions, disaster benefits, and loan distributions, which violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), and in failing to review cases of alleged discriminations.

Background
Prior to the Garcia v. Vilsack, a 1994 study of the Farm Service Agency, a program within the USDA, was conducted by the consulting firm D.J. Miller & Associates on behalf of the USDA. The purpose of the study was to look into the FSA's treatment of females and minorities, and specifically the organizations programs and payments. The study ultimately found that minority farmers were less likely to participate in the program because of the lengthy process, because farmers were not knowledgeable on rules and regulations, and minority farmers distrust of those processing appeals.
The case name comes from Jose Guadalupe Garcia, the primary plaintiff who was a third generation farmer from Las Cruces, New Mexico. In an appearance before the US House of Representatives, Garcia stated that loan officers and neighbors had worked in conjunction to bankrupt Garcia and his brother. Garcia's neighbors did eventually purchase his land.
The Garcia case came a year after Pigford v. Glickman (1999) which awarded African American farmers nearly $2 billion. Meanwhile, Native American farmers filed a class action lawsuit against the USDA, also known as Keepseagle v. Vilsack. Keepseagle was ultimately settled in 2010 for $680 million.

Rulings
A 2002 ruling by the district court did not classify the Hispanic/Latino farmers as a class therefore, Hispanic farmers who still wanted to file against the USDA had to do so individually. In addition to this, the farmers also experienced difficulties pinpointing the source of discrimination within the organization. This is in part due to the practice due to the large number of employees that the USDA employed across a number of departments who were then responsible for making decisions regarding farmers qualifications for loans and benefits. The statute of limitations established by the 2002 ruling, which gave a time frame from January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1996 and October 13, 1998, through 2002, meant that a number of Hispanic farmworkers were ineligible to file against the USDA.
In 2011, the USDA and the Department of Justice began allowing Hispanic and Latino farmers to participate in a voluntary claims process ",economics
History of the Caribbean,"The history of the Caribbean reveals the region's significant role in the colonial struggles of the European powers since the 15th century. In the modern era, it remains strategically and economically important. In 1492, Christopher Columbus landed in the Caribbean and claimed the region for Spain. The following year, the first Spanish settlements were established in the Caribbean. Although the Spanish conquests of the Aztec empire and the Inca empire in the early sixteenth century made Mexico and Peru more desirable places for Spanish exploration and settlement, the Caribbean remained strategically important.
From the 1620s and 1630s onwards, non-Hispanic privateers, traders, and settlers established permanent colonies and trading posts on the Caribbean islands neglected by Spain. Such colonies spread throughout the Caribbean, from the Bahamas in the northwest to Tobago in the southeast. Furthermore, during this period, French, Dutch, and English buccaneers settled on the island of Tortuga, the northern and western coasts of Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic), and later in Jamaica as well as the island of Martinica.
After the Spanish–American War in 1898, the islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico were no longer part of the Spanish Empire in the New World. In the 20th century, the Caribbean was again important during World War II, in the decolonization wave after the war, and in the tension between Communist Cuba and the United States. The exploitation of the labor of Indigenous peoples and the demographic collapse of that population, forced migration of enslaved Africans, immigration of Europeans, Chinese, South Asians, and others, and rivalry amongst world powers since the sixteenth century have given Caribbean history an impact disproportionate to its size. Many islands have attained independence from colonial powers and sovereignty; others have formal political ties with major powers, including the United States. The early economic structure integrating the Caribbean into the Atlantic world and world economic system continues to impact the modern Caribbean region.

Before European contact
During European contact in 1492, Caribbean islands were densely populated by different indigenous groups. Recent scholarly research has investigated the origins and evolution of the islands' populations over the entire period. At the beginning of the current geological epoch, the Holocene era, the northern part of South America was occupied by groups of small-game hunters, fishers, and foragers. These groups occasionally resided in semi-permanent campsites while mostly being mobile to use a wide range of plant and animal resources in various habitats.
Archaeological evidence suggests that Trinidad was the first Caribbean island settled as early as 9000/8000 BCE. However, the first settlers most likely arrived in Trinidad when it was still attached to South America by land bridges. It was not until about 7000/6000 BCE, during the early Holocene that Trinidad",history
Independent Ecology,"Independent Ecology was a description used in British politics to denote a form of non-party affiliation.  It was used to designate a green politician as was independent of any political party, particularly of the Ecology Party before its  transformation into the Green Party.
Since the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 came into force, a candidate for election can no longer be described as an ""Independent Ecology"" on a ballot paper, as the 1998 Act prohibits any description which could cause confusion with a registered political party.

Christian Cabrol,"Christian Emile Cabrol (16 September 1925 – 16 June 2017) was a French cardiac surgeon best known for performing Europe's first heart transplant at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in 1968.
Cabrol was born in the Chézy-sur-Marne, Aisne region of Northern France. He joined the French Resistance at the onset of the Second World War and after the war gained admission to the Salpêtrière Hospital to study medicine. His thesis on the anatomy of the lung was published in two volumes, following which he completed a fellowship with open heart surgery pioneer Walton Lillehei at the University of Minnesota.
On 27 April 1968, he performed France's and Europe's first heart transplant. In 1982, he performed Europe's first heart–lung transplant and four years later, he implanted Europe's first Jarvik Total Artificial Heart (TAH) as a bridge to transplantation. Throughout his surgical career, he also pioneered techniques in valvular surgery including the tricuspid annuloplasty.
Among numerous appointments and honorary posts, he was involved with the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) from its inception in 1981, becoming its president ten years later. In 1989, he became an active campaigner for organ donation with France Transplant and subsequently co-founded the Association for the Development and Innovation in Cardiology (ADICARE).  From 1994 to 1999, Cabrol represented France in the European Parliament and was affiliated with Rally for the Republic. He was named a commandeur of the Legion of Honour and awarded a National Order of Merit for his work.

Early life
Christian Cabrol was born on 16 September 1925 in the Chézy-sur-Marne, Aisne region of Northern France to a family descended from the shepherds of Cévennes. His father was a farmer, who kept bees and grew a vineyard. As a child, Cabrol would accompany his physician paternal grandfather on home visits, ultimately instilling the inspiration to study medicine. His maternal grandfather was a winegrower in a vineyard of Champagne.
He attended Chézy's school in a small town named Château-Thierry north-east of Paris. Thereafter, he was sent to board at the Marist Brothers Saint Laurent College in Lagny on
marne, until his education was interrupted by the Second World War. Cabrol subsequently joined the French Resistance movement following Hitler's occupation of Paris on 14 June 1940. Later, he entered Paris with General Leclerc of the Free French Army who liberated the city on 23 August 1944.

Early surgical training
After the war, Cabrol gained admission to the  Salpêtrière Hospital to study medicine. In 1949, he started his internship and joined professor Gaston-Jean Cordier in 1951, while simultaneously participating in the Laennec conferences. During his four years of internship, he worked with and was influenced by a number of renowned surgeons of the time, including Charles Dubost, Cordier who encouraged thoracic surgery and René Küss who emphasised organ transplantation.

Activated charcoal cleanse,"Activated charcoal cleanses, also known as charcoal detoxes, are a pseudoscientific use of a proven medical intervention. Activated charcoal is available in powder, tablet and liquid form. Its proponents claim the use of activated charcoal on a regular basis will detoxify and cleanse the body as well as boost one's energy and brighten the skin. Such claims violate basic principles of chemistry and physiology. There is no medical evidence for any health benefits of cleanses or detoxes via activated charcoal or any other method. Charcoal, when ingested, will absorb vitamins and nutrients as well as prescription medications present in the gastrointestinal tract which can make it dangerous to use unless directed by a medical doctor.

Background
Production and industrial applications
Activated charcoal, also known as activated carbon is commonly produced from high carbon source materials such as wood or coconut husk. It is made by treating the source material with either a combination of heat and pressure, or with a strong acid or base followed by carbonization to make it highly porous. This gives it a very large surface area for its volume, up to 3000 square metres per gram. It has a large number of industrial uses including methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment and air filters in gas masks and respirators.

Medical use
Activated charcoal is used to detoxify people, but only in life-threatening medical emergencies such as overdoses or poisonings. As it is indigestible it will only work on poisons or medications still present in the stomach and intestines. Once these have been absorbed by the body the charcoal will no longer be able to adsorb them so early intervention is desirable. Charcoal is not an effective treatment for alcohol, metals or elemental poisons such as lithium or arsenic as it will only adsorb certain chemicals and molecules. It is usually administered by a nasogastric tube into the stomach as the thick slurry required for maximum adsorption is very difficult to swallow.

Use in alternative therapies
Activated charcoal, as used in cleanses or detoxes, became popular around 2014 after it was brought to mainstream attention by Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop company where it was described as ""one of the best juice cleanses"". Since then, it has become a popular additive to many different types of foods and drinks including juices, lemonades, coffee, pastries, ice cream, burgers, pizzas and pet food. The City of New York has banned activated charcoal in food products unless approval for their use is granted from the FDA. Activated charcoal, excluding products designed for emergency medical interventions, is available in many pharmacies, wellness and health food stores in tablet, capsule and powder forms.

Proponents of charcoal detoxes claim that it will cleanse the body by aiding in the removal of excess toxins that the body is una",medicine
Bronze Age,"The Bronze Age (c. 3300 – c. 1200 BC) was a historical period characterised principally by the use of bronze tools and the development of complex urban societies, as well as the adoption of writing in some areas. The Bronze Age is the middle principal period of the three-age system, following the Stone Age and preceding the Iron Age. Conceived as a global era, the Bronze Age follows the Neolithic, with a transition period between the two known as the Chalcolithic. The final decades of the Bronze Age in the Mediterranean basin are often characterised as a period of widespread societal collapse known as the Late Bronze Age collapse (c. 1200 – c. 1150 BC), although its severity and scope are debated among scholars.
An ancient civilisation is deemed to be part of the Bronze Age if it either produced bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying it with tin, arsenic, or other metals, or traded other items for bronze from producing areas elsewhere. Bronze Age cultures were the first to develop writing. According to archaeological evidence, cultures in Mesopotamia, which used cuneiform script, and Egypt, which used hieroglyphs, developed the earliest practical writing systems. In the Archaeology of the Americas, a five-period system is conventionally used instead, which does not include a Bronze Age, though some cultures there did smelt copper and bronze. Indigenous metalworking arrived in Australia with European contact.
In many areas bronze continued to be rare and expensive, mainly because of difficulties in obtaining enough tin, which occurs in relatively few places, unlike the very common copper. Some societies appear to have gone through much of the Bronze Age using bronze only for weapons or elite art, such as Chinese ritual bronzes, with ordinary farmers largely still using stone tools. However, this is hard to assess as the rarity of bronze meant it was keenly recycled.

Metal use
Bronze Age civilisations gained a technological advantage due to bronze's harder and more durable properties than other metals available at the time. While terrestrial iron is naturally abundant, the higher temperature required for smelting, 1,250 °C (2,280 °F), in addition to the greater difficulty of working with it, placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the 2nd millennium BC. Tin's lower melting point of 232 °C (450 °F) and copper's moderate melting point of 1,085 °C (1,985 °F) placed both these metals within the capabilities of Neolithic pottery kilns, which date to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures of at least 900 °C (1,650 °F).

The Bronze Age is characterised by the widespread use of bronze, though the introduction and development of bronze technology were not universally synchronous. Bronze was independently discovered in the Maykop culture of the North Caucasus as early as the mid-4th millennium BC, which makes them the producers of the oldest-known bronze. However, the Maykop culture only had arsenical bronze. Other regions devel",history
Collective mental state,"Collective mental state is generally a literary or legal term, mostly used in sociology and philosophy (in addition to its singular use in psychiatry and psychology), to refer to the condition of someone's being-state when around others. An assessment of a collective mental state includes a description of thought processes, memory, emotions, mood, cognitive state, and energy levels, including the meta overlay of interactions between individuals.

Overview
A collective mental state is both distinct from and contains other mental states of self-aware individuals. The collective mental state forms the basis for individual reflection, juxtaposed with the collective state, that leads to realizations about emotions, states of being, and individuality. The collective mental state is made of conscious minds and may therefore be a more complex version of something like a stampede, which is itself caused by sentinel animals through imitation. Collective mental states may be simulated through the use of a performer and audience; stand-up comedy desires to have a group of people collectively, simultaneously feel one thing: laughter.

Background
When a mental state is shared by a large proportion of the members of a group or society, it can be called a collective mental state. Gustave Le Bon proposed that mental states are passed by contagion, while Sigmund Freud wrote of war fever in his work Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1922), a perfect example of the collective mental state. Franz Borkenau wrote of collective madness, while many writers have discussed collective depression. Psychosis can be passed from one individual to another as induced psychosis or folie à deux, but rarely involves more than two people. When the mental state involves a large population, it is more appropriate to use plain English rather than psychiatric or psychological terminology.

Instances of collective mental states
Church (congregation) with collective states like prayer, worship, hymns, speaking in tongues, etc.
Sports with collective audience states, like booing; bullfighting, WWE, football, American football (including the collective home viewership of these things)
Concerts where moshing and collective singing occurs
Riot
Carnivalesque
Racism
Horror film audience
A positive example of a collective mental state would be at a rave or music festival. People come together through music and may feel content or relaxed, even though they may be surrounded by strangers in a loud, stimulating environment. On the other hand, in a dangerous situation, people can experience high levels of fear and anxiety if they are in a group of people that is panicking. An example of this is when a large group try to get out of a building and the individuals at the front are crushed against the doors by the weight of the people behind them.
A type of angry collective state is often referred to as mob mentality. The members of the group feed off of each other's anger and the collective ",science
Plantation economy,"A plantation economy is an economy based on agricultural mass production, usually of a few commodity crops, grown on large farms worked by laborers or slaves. The properties are called plantations. Plantation economies rely on the export of cash crops as a source of income. Prominent crops included cotton, rubber, sugar cane, tobacco, figs, rice, kapok, sisal, Red Sandalwood, and species in the genus Indigofera, used to produce indigo dye.
The longer a crop's harvest period, the more efficient plantations become. Economies of scale are also achieved when the distance to market is long. Plantation crops usually need processing immediately after harvesting. Sugarcane, tea, sisal, and palm oil are most suited to plantations, while coconuts, rubber, and cotton are suitable to a lesser extent.

Conditions for formation
Plantation economies are factory-like, industrialised and centralised forms of agriculture, owned by large corporations or affluent owners. Under normal circumstances, plantation economies are not as efficient as small farm holdings, since there is immense difficulty in proper supervision of labour over a large land area. When there are large distances between the plantations and their markets, processing can reduce the bulk of the crop and lower shipping costs.
Large plantations producing large quantities of a good are able to achieve economies of scale for expensive processing machinery, as the per unit cost of processing is greatly diminished. This economy of scale can be achieved best with tropical crops that are harvested continuously through the year, fully utilising the processing machinery. Examples of crops that are suitable to be processed are sugar, sisal, palm oil, and tea.

American plantations
In the Thirteen Colonies, plantations were concentrated in the South. These colonies included Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. They had good soil and long growing seasons, ideal for crops such as rice and tobacco. The existence of many waterways in the region made transportation easier. Each colony specialized in one or two crops, with Virginia standing out in tobacco production.

Slavery
Planters embraced the use of slaves mainly because indentured labor became expensive. Some indentured servants were also leaving to start their own farms as land was widely available. Colonists tried to use Native Americans for labor, but they were susceptible to European diseases and died in large numbers. The plantation owners then turned to enslaved Africans for labor. In 1665, there were fewer than 500 Africans in Virginia but by 1750, 85 percent of the 235,000 slaves lived in the Southern colonies, Virginia included. Africans made up 40 percent of the South's population.
According to the 1840 United States census, one out of every four families in Virginia owned slaves. There were over 100 plantation owners who owned over 100 slaves. The number of slaves in the 15 States was just shy of 4 million in a total popul",economics
Dummy candidate,"A dummy candidate is a candidate who stands for election, usually with no intention or realistic chance of winning.
A dummy candidate can serve any of the following purposes:

In instant-runoff voting, a dummy candidate may direct preferences to other candidates in order to increase the serious candidate's share of the vote.
A dummy candidate may be used by a serious candidate to overcome limits on advertising or campaign financing. For example, in India, there have been cases of serious candidates fielding multiple dummy candidates to distribute their poll expenses. The expenses are directed towards the campaign of the serious candidate, but shown to the election commission under the dummy candidates' names.
Dummy candidates with names similar to that of a more established candidate may be fielded by political parties to confuse the voters, and cut that candidate's vote share. The dummy candidate's name also may be deceptively similar to that of a retiring incumbent, a former candidate or officeholder, or even a deceased former candidate or officeholder.  (The Eddie Murphy film The Distinguished Gentleman was somewhat based on this premise.) For example, in the 2014 Indian general elections, there were seven candidates named Chandu Lal Sahu and another four named Chandu Ram Sahu in the Mahasamund. The serious candidate – Chandu Lal Sahu of the Bharatiya Janata Party – received 503,514 votes, but his margin of win was just 1,217 votes. The dummy candidates received the votes intended for him, with one of them finishing third in the constituency. To solve this problem, the Election Commission of India is designing Electronic Voting Machines with candidates' photographs. In the 1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election, a minor candidate changed his name to ""Roy Harold Jenkins"" to confuse voters looking for Roy H. Jenkins.
A dummy candidate may serve as a placeholder for a party in a primary and then withdraw after winning the primary, allowing the leadership of the party an opportunity to nominate the candidate they really desire to fill their line for the general election.
Dummy candidates can also result from candidates withdrawing from a particular race, but being unable to pull their name off the ballot, remaining listed as a choice.

Beikou,"Boikoo tarkbei or Daur hockey is a game similar to field hockey or street hockey. It has been played for about 1,000 years by the Daur people, an ethnic group from Inner Mongolia, China.
The game involves teams of men playing a ball-like knob of apricot root with long wooden branches. At night, the game is played with a felt-covered ball that is set alight. A game is reported to last for two periods of roughly 15 minutes.
Poolie tarkbei is the Daur version of polo. Boikoo and poolie are two popular game among Daurs.
Some Daurs believe the Daur term boikoo and poolie was originated from Chinese term buqiu (budaqiu or buqiu was a popular game in Tang China) and Tibetan term polon, and deny the Khitan origin of Daurs. Others believe the Daur boikoo was originated from the Khitan hockey.
When Western field hockey was introduced to China, it was taken up enthusiastically by the Daurs, whose affinity for the game has helped China to improve its global standing in field hockey. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, a third of the Chinese men's field hockey team was from Morin Dawa, a city in the Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner in Inner Mongolia.

Anti-politics,"Anti-politics is a term used to describe opposition to, or distrust in, traditional politics. It is closely connected with anti-establishment sentiment and public disengagement from formal politics. Anti-politics can indicate practices and actors that seek to remove political contestation from the public arena, leading to political apathy among citizens; when used this way the term is similar to depoliticisation. Alternatively, if politics is understood as encompassing all social institutions and power relations, anti-politics can mean political activity stemming from a rejection of ""politics as usual"".
Anti-politics tends to focus on negative assessments of politicians and political elites by civic organisations, the media and citizens, whereas political apathy may involve disaffection with other elements of a political system, such as the electoral system or party system. Since the 2000s, increasing dissatisfaction with democracy has been a theme of scholarship in both the Americas and Europe, with some political scientists describing high levels of political antipathy as a 'crisis' which risks democratic deconsolidation. Anti-politics has become a key concept in accounts of political dysfunction in liberal democracies, typically dissatisfaction with politics and mistrust of politicians.
Possible causes of anti-political sentiment include the processes associated with depoliticisation, especially an increase in technocratic forms of governance, as well as citizens' perceptions of incompetent governance and the poor performance of politicians. Political distrust can originate from, and increase support for, a range of different political ideologies, including both left-wing and right-wing positions and the extremes of these. Healthy levels of mistrust in politics are often seen as legitimate scepticism and considered beneficial for democratic functioning. High distrust can increase the divide between policy-makers (politicians, or the political establishment) and citizens, which provides opportunities for populist rhetoric. Anti-politics is often expressed through appeals to ""the people"" and is consequently linked with populism, particularly, but not exclusively, right-wing populism.

Conceptual history
The idea gained attention with the publication of The Anti-Politics Machine by anthropologist James Ferguson in 1990. Ferguson developed a thesis that rural development projects funded by the World Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency in Lesotho increased bureaucratic state power in the country and depoliticised both the state and poverty, causing them to become non-political issues. Ferguson consequently described development as an ""anti-politics machine"". Ferguson's model has been applied to other developing countries such as India, and anti-politics has also been used to critique the shared administration of resources involving Indigenous peoples in Canada and North America.

History of Sardinia,"Archaeological evidence of prehistoric human settlement on the island of Sardinia is present in the form of nuraghes and other prehistoric monuments, which dot the land. The recorded history of Sardinia begins with its contacts with the various people who sought to dominate western Mediterranean trade in classical antiquity: Phoenicians, Punics and Romans. Initially under the political and economic alliance with the Phoenician cities, it was partly conquered by Carthage in the late 6th century BC and then entirely by Rome after the First Punic War (230 BC). The island was included for centuries in the Roman province of Sardinia and Corsica, which would be incorporated into the diocese of Italia suburbicaria in 3rd and 7th centuries.
In the Early Middle Ages, through the European barbarian movements, the waning of the Byzantine Empire influence in the western Mediterranean and the Saracen raids, the island fell out of the sphere of influence of any higher government; this led to the birth of four independent kingdoms called Judicates (Latin: Judicati; Sardinian: Judicados) in the 8th through 10th centuries. Falling under papal influence, Sardinia became the focus of the rivalry of Genoa, Pisa, and the Crown of Aragon, which eventually subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324. The Iberian Kingdom was to last until 1718, when it was ceded to the House of Savoy; from Piedmont, the Savoyards pursued a policy of expansion to the rest of the Italian peninsula, having their Kingdom of Sardinia be later renamed into ""Kingdom of Italy"" in 1861.

Prehistory
The oldest trace in Sardinia of the anthropomorphic prehistoric primate called Oreopithecus bambolii is dated to 8.5 million years ago. In 1996 a hominid finger bone, dated up to 250.000 BC, was found in a cave in the Logudoro region.
Modern humans appeared in the island during the Upper Paleolithic, a phalanx dated to 18000 BC had been found in the Corbeddu cave, near Oliena. Mesolithic human remains had been discovered at Su Coloru cave of Laerru but also in the south (Sirri, Arbus).
Already in the Stone Age, Monte Arci played an important role. The old volcano was one of the central places where obsidian was found and worked for cutting tools and arrowheads. Even now the volcanic glass can be found on the sides of the mountain.
The Neolithic began in Sardinia in the 6th millennium BC with the Cardial culture. Later, important cultures like the Ozieri culture and the Arzachena culture of the late Neolithic and the Abealzu-Filigosa and Monte Claro culture of the Chalcolithic period, developed in the island contemporaneously with the appearance of the megalithic phenomenon.
The dolmens culture, around the end of the 3rd millennium BC, passed with other typical material aspects of Western Europe (e.g. Bell Beaker) through by the Sardinian coast even in Sicily.
Prehistoric and Pre-nuragic monuments and constructions that characterise the Sardinian landscapes are the Domus de Janas (Sardinian:",history
Finlandization,"Finlandization (Finnish: suomettuminen) is the process by which one powerful country makes a smaller neighboring country refrain from opposing the former's foreign policy rules, while allowing it to keep its nominal independence and its own political system. The term means ""to become like Finland"", referring to the influence of the Soviet Union on Finland's policies during the Cold War.
The term is often considered pejorative. It originated in the West German political debate of the late 1960s and 1970s. As the term was used in West Germany and other NATO countries, it referred to the decision of a country not to challenge a more powerful neighbor in foreign politics, while maintaining national sovereignty.  It is commonly used in reference to Finland's policies in relation to the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but it can refer more generally to similar international relations, such as Denmark's attitude toward Germany between 1871 and 1940, or the policies of the Swiss government towards Nazi Germany until the end of World War II.

Origin and international usage
In Germany, the term was used mainly by proponents of closer adaptation to US policies, chiefly Franz Josef Strauss, but was initially coined in scholarly debate, and made known by the German political scientists Richard Löwenthal, Walter Hallstein and Kurt Birrenbach, reflecting feared effects of withdrawal of US troops from Germany. It came to be used in the debate of the NATO countries in response to Willy Brandt's attempts to normalise relations with East Germany, and the following widespread scepticism in Germany against NATO's Dual-Track Decision. Later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the term has been used in Finland for the post-1968 radicalization in the latter half of the Urho Kekkonen era.
In the 1990s, Finlandization was also discussed as a potential strategy that the Soviet Union under Gorbachev may have attempted to revise its relationship with the Warsaw Pact states from 1989 to 1991, as a way to transition from informal empire to a looser sphere of influence model, which was precluded by the fall of the USSR.
As early as 2010 Shinzo Abe feared the Finlandization of Japan and South Korea to China, because of its growing influence and power.
The term has also been used in discussing other countries, for example as a potential outcome of the Russo-Ukrainian War.

Finnish perception
Finns have, and had, a wide variety of reactions to the term ""Finlandization"". Some have perceived the term as blunt criticism, stemming from an inability to understand the practicalities of how a small nation needs to deal with an adjacent superpower without losing its sovereignty. These practicalities existed primarily because of the lingering effect of Russian rule in the time before the Finns first gained sovereignty; and because of the precarious power balance eastwards, springing from a geographically extended yet sparsely populated state with a traditionally imperialist superpower r",politics

Universal football,"Universal football was the name given to a proposed hybrid sport of Australian rules football and rugby league, proposed at different times between 1908 and 1933 as a potential national football code to be played throughout Australia and New Zealand. The game was trialled, but it was never otherwise played in any regular competition.

Background
By the early 20th century, Australian rules football, which had originated in Victoria in 1858, had been established as the dominant football code in Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, holding that position since the 1870s or 1880s. Rugby football, which originated in the English Rugby School, had been the dominant code in New South Wales throughout the same time. In Queensland, Australian rules was originally dominant, up until the 1880s, after which rugby became the leading code.
One of the earliest mentions of a hybrid code was in 1874 when Brisbane's Victorian Association (Australian Rules) clubs and the two Brisbane rugby clubs Rangers and Bonnet Rouge experimented with mixed rules to compete against each other, however it was ultimately deemed a failure, with clubs instead opting to co-operate until the growing rift caused the Northern Rugby Union to break away from the Queensland Football Association (1880-1890) and ultimately become more popular.
In 1884 H C A Harrison known then as the ""father of Australian Football"" visited London where he proposed unifying Australian rules with Rugby under a set of hybrid rules and suggested that rugby clubs adopt some of the Victorian Rules. Football officials were insulted at the suggestion that they ""abandon their rules to oblige an Antipodean game"".
The preeminence of the traditional rugby union code was usurped by the newer and professional rugby league code with its introduction from northern England to Australia in 1907.
The idea of combining the two sports to create a ""universal football"" code to be played throughout Australia, and potentially around the world, arose at around the same time as rugby league began in Australia.

1908 Conference
The first conference addressing the matter was held in 1908 between the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL), led by the league's founding administrator J. J. Giltinan, and Australian rules football officials, led by Australasian Football Council (AFC) president Con Hickey, with the view towards developing a hybrid set of rules which could be proposed to England's Northern Rugby Football Union (the administrative body for rugby league based in England) on the upcoming 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain – rugby league as a code distinct from rugby union was a small and new code at the time, prominent only in northern England since 1895 and in Australasia for only a few years, so major rule changes which could be adopted worldwide were still a possibility. However, there was no action resolved from this initial conference. With the AFC's preference for the Australian code to be played only",sports
Indoor cricket,"Indoor cricket is a variant of and shares many basic concepts with cricket. The game is most often played between two teams each consisting of six or eight players.
Several versions of the game have been in existence since the late 1960s, whilst the game in its present form began to take shape in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The codified sport of indoor cricket is not to be confused with conventional cricket played indoors, or with other modified versions of cricket played indoors (see other forms of indoor cricket below).

The game of cricket
In terms of the concept of the game indoor cricket is similar to cricket. Like its outdoor cousin, indoor cricket involves two batters, a bowler and a team of fielders. The bowler bowls the ball to the batters who must score runs. The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins. Despite these basic similarities, the game itself differs significantly from its traditional counterpart in several ways, most notably on the field of play and the means by which runs are obtained.

International rules overview
Safety gear
As a minimum, every male player, including the fielders have to wear an abdominal guard (box), with the person bowling the ball as an exception.
The batsman are required to use batting gloves, primarily for preventing the bat from slipping out of the hands. Indoor batting gloves are readily available at cricket stores, however some indoor cricket facilities also provide basic non-slip gloves that can be shared during the game.Some players prefer to use hard ball batting gloves to prevent their hands from serious injury, as the indoor cricket ball can cause serious damage.
One optional security gadget is safety goggles to prevent any serious injury to the eyes. As the game speed is usually very fast and the play rigorous, it is a demanding cardiovascular activity. It is recommended to have a doctor checkup before taking up indoor cricket, especially in advance age and/or with any medical conditions. It's fielders right of way when a shot is played, so the batsman/fielder has to be watchful to avoid collisions.Indoor cricket causes more sporting injuries than casual outdoor cricket, due to the proximity of the ball and fielders. Therefore, a sports/team insurance is important.Some indoor sports facilities provide these insurances as part of the indoor tournaments.

Playing arena
The length of an indoor cricket pitch is the same as a conventional cricket pitch, and has 3 stumps at each end, but there the similarities end. The arena is completely enclosed by tight netting, a few metres from each side and end of the pitch. The playing surface is normally artificial grass matting.Whilst the pitch is the same length, however, the batters do not have to run the entire length.The striker's crease is in the regulation place in front of the stumps, but the non-striker's crease is only halfway down the pitch.

Electronics industry in the Socialist Republic of Romania,"The electronics industry in the Socialist Republic of Romania was characterized by stronger ties to Western Europe when compared to other countries in the Eastern Bloc, due to the drive of the Romanian leadership towards greater autonomy from the Soviet Union.

History
In 1960, the government of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej decided to build an electronics plant in the forest of Băneasa, which in 1962 was named Băneasa Radio and Semiconductor Parts Company (Romanian: Întreprinderea de piese radio și semiconductori or I.P.R.S.). The production of integrated circuits started in 1970 with technology from Thomson-CSF.: 7  The plant developed steadily and grew to 6,000 employees by the early 1980s. By 1990, the product range included bipolar digital and linear integrated circuits (including 7400 series integrated circuits), silicon transistors and diodes, microwave devices, thyristors, triacs, and capacitors. I.P.R.S. manufactured with the designation βP14500 a clone of the 1-bit-microprocessor Motorola MC14500B in I2L technology.
In 1969, the Research Center for the Design of Electronic Components (Romanian: Centrul de Cercetare Proiectare pentru Componente Electronice or CCPCE) was established on the grounds of I.P.R.S., but independent from it. The research center developed semiconductor products from initial experiments to pilot production, at which point the mass manufacturing was handed over to I.P.R.S. By 1974, the center moved to a new headquarter adjacent to I.P.R.S. and changed its name to Research Institute for Electronic Components (Romanian: Institutul de Cercetare pentru Componente Electronice or ICCE). With new production facilities opened in 1979, the institute started to manufacture transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, optoelectronics, and microwave devices for end customers, in particular products that were needed only in small quantities (a few thousand per month) and could therefore not be manufactured economically at I.P.R.S.

A third entity, Microelectronica was set up in 1981 close to I.P.R.S. and ICCE, with the goal of manufacturing PMOS, NMOS and CMOS integrated circuits (including 4000-series integrated circuits), as well as optoelectronics, complementing the production profile of I.P.R.S. Microelectronica manufactured a clone of the Intel 8080 with the designation MMN8080 and a clone of the Zilog Z80 with the designation MMN80CPU.: 661  The MMN80CPU entered production in 1988. For comparison, the original Z80 was launched in 1976 and the East German clone U880 in 1980.

After 1990
I.P.R.S. remained in government hands until 2003. After a factory upgrade in 1992 a steady decline set in. The number of employees dropped to 5,000 in 1991 and 2,000 at the end of the 1990s.

Government,"A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state.
In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy. In many countries, the government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy.
While all types of organizations have governance, the term government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments and subsidiary organizations.
The main types of modern political systems recognized are democracies, totalitarian regimes, and, sitting between these two, authoritarian regimes with a variety of hybrid regimes. Modern classification systems also include monarchies as a standalone entity or as a hybrid system of the main three. Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy, and tyranny. These forms are not always mutually exclusive, and mixed governments are common. The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained, with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession.

Definitions and etymology
A government is the system to govern a state or community. The Columbia Encyclopedia defines government as ""a system of social control under which the right to make laws, and the right to enforce them, is vested in a particular group in society"". While all types of organizations have governance, the word government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments on Earth, as well as their subsidiary organizations, such as state and provincial governments as well as local governments.
The word government derives from the Greek verb κυβερνάω [kubernáo] meaning to steer with a gubernaculum (rudder), the metaphorical sense being attested in the literature of classical antiquity, including Plato's Ship of State. In British English, ""government"" sometimes refers to what's also known as a ""ministry"" or an ""administration"", i.e., the policies and government officials of a particular executive or governing coalition. Finally, government is also sometimes used in English as a synonym for rule or governance.
In other languages, cognates may have a narrower scope, such as the government of Portugal, which is more similar to the concept of ""administration"".

History
Earliest governments
The moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time; however, history does record the formations of early governments. About 5,000 years ago, the first small city-states appeared. By the third to second millenniums BC, some of these had developed into larger governed areas: Sumer, ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley civilization, and the Yellow River civilization.

Biotechnology and genetic engineering in Bangladesh,"Biotechnology and genetic engineering in Bangladesh is one of the thriving fields of science and technology in the country.

History
The research for biotechnology in Bangladesh started in the late 1970s. The root cause behind the initiation was the significance of agricultural sector, which had been the backbone of the national economy since the ancient times. The research first started in the department of Genetics and Plant Breeding in Bangladesh Agricultural University through Tissue culture on jute. Subsequently, within the next 10–12 years, similar research programs began to take place in the Faculty of Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, University of Rajshahi, University of Chittagong, University of Khulna,  Islamic University, Kushtia, Jagannath University, Jahangirnagar University,  Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Sylhet Agricultural University, Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University,  Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Bangladesh Forest Research Institute, Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute and Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission. In 1990, Bangladesh Association for Plant Tissue Culture (BAPTC) was formed which has been organising several international conferences since its inception. In September 1993, the government of Bangladesh formed a National Committee on Biotechnology Product Development to select potential biotechnological projects which could be leased out for commercialisation. In collaboration with BAPTC, the Ministry of Science and Technology organised a workshop on Biosafety Regulation in 1997, after which a task force was formed to formulate biosafety guidelines and biosafety regulations in the light of the regulation of the workshop. In the late 1990s, Bangladesh became a member of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB). In 1999, the National Institute of Biotechnology was established as the centre of excellence in biotechnological education. To accelerate multidimensional biotechnological research, in 2006, the government adopted the national policy guidelines on biotechnology which was approved by the National Task force on biotechnology. In 2012, the cabinet approved the draft of National Biotechnology Policy, 2012 which was aimed at eradicating poverty through increasing productivity in agriculture and industrial sectors.

Karen (orangutan),"Karen (born 11 June 1992) is a Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii), who on 27 August 1994 at the San Diego Zoo was the first orangutan to have open heart surgery and in 2021 was among the first non-humans to receive a vaccine for COVID-19.
Concerns for the endangered species of Sumatran orangutan at a time when routine open heart surgery was being performed in human babies, combined with a collaboration between the San Diego Zoo and UC San Diego Health, led to the planning of repairing the large hole in the heart in two-year-old Karen. The operation and after-care required the co-operation of more than 100 volunteers and the resulting procedure was successful and widely publicised. Karen became a favorite with zoo visitors, surviving more than 25 years.
Karen is the subject of a book by Georgeanne Irvine titled Karen’s Heart: The True Story of a Brave Baby Orangutan, published by Blue Sneaker Press in 2018.

Background
Wild Sumatran orangutans are critically endangered. In the 1970s, UC San Diego Health (UCSD) pathologist Kurt Benirschke, persuaded zoo trustees to establish a research department, at the zoo's Center for the Reproduction of Endangered Species, which he subsequently led, providing the collaboration between the University and the zoo. 
Orangutan and human hearts have much similarity, and open heart surgery had become routine in human babies.

Early life and family
Karen, also known as ""Kare-Bear"", a Sumatran orangutan, was born at the San Diego Zoo on 11 June 1992 to nine-year-old mother Karta and father Otis. 
After 1995, Karta lost six infants over the course of 15 years. Observations eventually led to the discovery of Karta's difficulties in breastfeeding due to her small nipples. Her babies were either stillborn or could not latch on and therefore failed to thrive.
The zookeepers observed that Karen was not being nursed in the first few days of life and she was therefore removed from Karta. On reintroducing her back to Karta, no change was seen and Karen was removed again to be handraised. Karta was subsequently sent to Adelaide Zoo in November 1992 and Karen was adopted by orangutan Josephine.
Karen was found to have a heart murmur at a health check-up at the age of two, after it was noted that she was not growing at the appropriate speed. Tests then confirmed a penny-size hole in the heart. At the time, Karen weighed 22 pounds (10.0 kg) and her condition was considered fatal without surgical correction.

Heart surgery
A surgical team led by cardiothoracic surgeon Stuart W. Jamieson from UCSD repaired the defect by opening Karen's chest and heart and stitching the hole to close it. Despite some structural variation between Karen's chest wall and that of a human, once inside the chest cavity, the surgeons felt familiar with the heart surgery. The whole procedure required the co-operation of a number of surgeons, nurses, anaesthetists, medical technicians, veterinarians and animal keepers and lasted seven hours. Jamieson reported t",medicine
Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period,"The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (Chinese: 五代十國) was an era of political upheaval and division in Imperial China from 907 to 979. Five dynastic states quickly succeeded one another in the Central Plain, and more than a dozen concurrent dynastic states, collectively known as the Ten Kingdoms, were established elsewhere, mainly in South China. It was a prolonged period of multiple political divisions in Chinese imperial history.
Traditionally, the era is seen as beginning with the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907 and reaching its climax with the founding of the Song dynasty in 960. In the following 19 years, Song gradually subdued the remaining states in South China, but the Liao dynasty still remained in China's north (eventually succeeded by the Jin dynasty), and the Western Xia was eventually established in China's northwest.
Many states had been de facto independent long before 907 as the late Tang dynasty's control over its numerous fanzhen officials waned, but the key event was their recognition as sovereign by foreign powers. After the Tang collapsed, several warlords of the Central Plain crowned themselves emperor. During the 70-year period, there was near-constant warfare between the emerging kingdoms and the alliances they formed. All had the ultimate goal of controlling the Central Plain and establishing themselves as the Tang's successor.
The last of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms regimes was Northern Han, which held out until Song conquered it in 979. For the next several centuries, although the Song controlled much of South China, they coexisted alongside the Liao dynasty, Jin dynasty, and various other regimes in China's north, until finally all of them were conquered by the Yuan dynasty.

Background
Towards the end of the Tang dynasty, the imperial government granted increased powers to the jiedushi (Chinese: 節度使), the regional military governors. The An Lushan (755–763) and Huang Chao rebellions weakened the imperial government, and by the early 10th century the jiedushi commanded de facto independence from its authority. In the last decades of the Tang dynasty, they were not even appointed by the central court anymore, but developed hereditary systems, from father to son or from patron to protégé. They had their own armies rivaling the ""palace armies"" and amassed huge wealth, as testified by their sumptuous tombs. Due to the decline of Tang central authority after the An Lushan Rebellion, there was a growing tendency to superimpose large regional administrations over the old districts and prefectures that had been used since the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). These administrations, known as circuit commissions, would become the boundaries of the later Southern regimes; many circuit commissioners became the emperors or kings of these states.
The historian Hugh Clark proposed a three-stage model of broad political trends during this time period. The first stage (880–910) consists of the period between the Huang Chao Rebelli",history
Hepcidin,"Hepcidin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the HAMP gene. Hepcidin is a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulation in mammals.
During conditions in which the hepcidin level is abnormally high, such as inflammation, serum iron falls due to iron trapping within macrophages and liver cells and decreased gut iron absorption. This typically leads to anemia due to an inadequate amount of blood serum iron being available for developing red blood cells. When the hepcidin level is  abnormally low, such as in hemochromatosis, iron overload occurs due to increased ferroportin mediated iron efflux from storage and increased gut iron absorption.

Structure
Hepcidin is initially synthesized as an 84-amino acid preprohormone (preprohepcidin) which undergoes sequential cleavages to form the active, mature hormone. The first cleavage by signal peptidase removes the 24-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide, creating a 60-amino acid prohepcidin. Furin-like convertase and α-1 antitrypsin then cleave prohepcidin to remove a 35-amino acid proregion, resulting in the 25-amino acid mature, bioactive hepcidin. There are also shorter isoforms of hepcidin, with 20 and 22 amino acids, which have minimal iron regulatory activity. Only the 9 N-terminal amino acids are essential for hepcidin's biological activity, specifically its ability to bind to ferroportin and regulate iron metabolism. 
Structurally, hepcidin is a tightly folded polypeptide with 32% beta-sheet character and a hairpin tertiary structure stabilized by four disulfide bonds among eight cystein residues (crucial structure). Hepcidin's structure has been elucidated through solution NMR, revealing that it interconverts between two conformations at different temperatures. X-ray analysis of a co-crystal with Fab confirmed a structure similar to the high-temperature NMR structure.

Function
Hepcidin is a regulator of iron metabolism. It inhibits iron transport by binding to the iron export channel ferroportin which is located in the basolateral plasma membrane of gut enterocytes and the plasma membrane of reticuloendothelial cells (macrophages), ultimately resulting in ferroportin breakdown in lysosomes. It has been shown that hepcidin is able to bind to the central cavity of ferroportin, thus occluding iron export from the cell. This suggests that hepcidin is able to regulate iron export independently of ferroportin endocytosis and ubiquitination, and is thus quickly inducible and reversible.  
In enterocytes, this prevents iron transmission into the hepatic portal system, thereby reducing dietary iron absorption. In macrophages, ferroportin inhibition causes iron be to stored within the cell. Increased hepcidin activity is partially responsible for reduced iron availability seen in anemia of chronic inflammation, such as kidney failure; this may explain why patients with end stage kidney failure may not respond to oral iron replacement.
Any one of several mutations in hepcidin will result in j",medicine

Home economics,"Home economics, also called domestic science or family and consumer sciences (often shortened to FCS or FACS), is a subject concerning human development, personal and family finances, consumer issues, housing and interior design, nutrition and food preparation, as well as textiles and apparel. Although historically mostly taught in secondary school or high school, dedicated home economics courses are much less common today.
Home economics courses are offered around the world and across multiple educational levels. Historically, the purpose of these courses was to professionalize housework, to provide intellectual fulfillment for women, to emphasize the value of ""women's work"" in society, and to prepare them for the traditional roles of sexes. Family and consumer sciences are taught as an elective or required course in secondary education, as a continuing education course in institutions, and at the primary level.  
Beginning in Scotland in the 1850s, it was a woman-dominated course, teaching women to be homemakers with sewing being the lead skill. The American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences at the beginning of the 20th century saw Americans desiring youth to learn vocational skills as well. Politics played a role in home economics education, and it wasn't until later in the century that the course shifted from being woman-dominated to now required for both sexes.  
Now family and consumer science have been included in the broader subject of Career Technical Education, a program that teaches skilled trades, applied sciences, modern technologies, and career preparation.  Despite the widening of the subject matter over the past century, there has been a major decline in home economics courses offered by educational institutions.

Terminology
Family and consumer sciences were previously known in the United States as home economics, often abbreviated as ""home ec"" or ""HE"". In 1994, various organizations, including the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences, adopted the new term ""Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS)"" to reflect the fact that the field covers aspects outside of home life and wellness. FCS is taught worldwide, as an elective or a required course in secondary education, and in many tertiary and continuing education institutions. Sometimes it is also taught in primary education. International cooperation in the field is coordinated by the International Federation for Home Economics, established in 1908.
These programs have been called human sciences, home science, domestic economy, and the domestic arts, the domestic sciences, or the domestic arts and sciences, and may still be referred to as such depending on the academic institution. Home economics has a strong historic relationship to the field of human ecology, and since the 1960s a number of university-level home economics programs have been renamed ""human ecology"" programs, including Cornell University's program.

Applied anthropology,"Applied anthropology is the practical application of anthropological theories, methods, and practices to the analysis and solution of practical problems. The term was first put forward by Daniel G. Brinton in his paper ""The Aims of Anthropology"". John Van Willengen defined applied anthropology as ""anthropology put to use"". Applied anthropology includes conducting research with a primary or tertiary purpose to solve real-world problems in areas such as public health, education, government, and business. 
In Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application, Kedia and Van Willigen define the process as a ""complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy"". In other words, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community.

Spanning academic disciplines
The American Anthropological Association (AAA) website describes anthropology as a focus on ""the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as the humanities and physical sciences."" Thus, the field of anthropology encompasses four subareas: sociocultural anthropology, biological (or physical) anthropology, archaeology, and linguistic anthropology. Because a central tenet of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an ""applied anthropologist"". In fact, some practical, real-world problems invoke all sub-disciplines of anthropological theory, method, and practice. For example, a Native American community development program may involve archaeological research to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore language competence among inhabitants, and medical anthropology to determine the causality of dietary deficiency diseases.

Professional engagement
Applied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as governments, development agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), tribal and ethnic associations, advocacy groups, social-service and educational agencies, and businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy projects, and even new specialized NGOs.
Methodology utilized in applied anthropology includes, but is not limited to, ethnography, participant observatio",science
Wakeskating,"Wakeskating is a water sport and an adaptation of wakeboarding that employs a similar design of board manufactured from maple or fibreglass. Unlike wakeboarding, the rider is not bound to the board in any way, similar to the skateboard, from which the name derives.

Design
Fins are constructed of plastic, fiberglass or aluminum. Shorter fins must be deeper to get the same amount of tracking. A shallower fin does not track as well as a deeper one. But a deeper fin has more drag in the water, and does not release from the water as fast.
Wakeskating shoes are designed with quick drying materials and drainage channels. The drainage channels are a system of holes in the sole and channels through the midsole.
Most wakeskate boards are made with grip tape on the upper side like skateboards. The grip tape is like sandpaper; it helps the rider to stay on the board and provides good traction, and is the main reason why rider wears shoes. Some boards are made with a foam instead of grip-tape, and can be ridden barefoot; the foam is easier on the skin than grip tape in case of a fall.

History
Wakeskating was pioneered by Thomas Horrell in the United States. Wakeskating has become urbanized due to the advent of the ""winch"", a mechanical device with a small horizontal shaft engine that holds a spool of rope and pulls the rope at riding speed.
Wakeskates are characterised by five parameters: size, material, deck shape, deck surface and rocker type.

Size
The appropriate length for a wakeskate depends on the rider's weight. A 39-inch wakeskate is suitable for a 180-pound rider. A wakeskate 41 or more inches long is best for a riders weighing 250 pounds or more.  Shorter, lighter wakeskates are easy to maneuver and can be easily flicked, but they are comparatively unstable as the rider lands on the surface of the water. Larger wakeskates with more surface area are more stable.

Material
Wakeskate may be made of wood, or a composite material. A wood wakeskate consists of a wooden skate coated with marine-grade epoxy that gives it a finished look and prolongs its life. However, wooden wakeskates do not last as long as composite ones as the wood degrades with constant exposure to water, and do not usually have a manufacturer's warranty.
More expensive composite wakeskates, made of synthetic materials that do not degrade quickly with exposure to water, are more popular especially among professional riders because of their lighter weight and longer life.

Jakob Eduard Polak,"Jakob Eduard Polak (12 November 1818 – 8 October 1891) was an Austrian physician, born to a Jewish family from Bohemia, who played an important role in introducing modern medicine in Iran.

Life
Polak studied medicine in Prague and Vienna. He was one of the six Austrian teachers invited by Amir Kabir, the Persian chief minister, as the instructors of Dar ul-Fonun, the first modern higher education institution in Iran. By his own account, he entered Iran on 24 November 1851, before the inauguration of the Dar ul-Fonun.
From 1851 to 1860, he taught medicine at Dar ul-Fonun. In the beginning, he taught in French and used a translator. Soon, the incompetence of the translators motivated him to learn Persian. He learned Persian in six months, and then taught his course in Persian.
In 1885, he funded Otto Stapf, a Viennese botanist, to undertake a botanical expedition to South- and Western Persia. This led to the discovery of numerous new species of plants.
From 1855 to 1860, he served as personal physician of Naser-al-din Shah. In this capacity he was succeeded by French physician Joseph Désiré Tholozan.

Works
Polak published his Persian experiences in: ""Persien, das Land und seine Bewohner; Ethnograpische Schilderungen"" (Leipzig, Brockhaus, 1865), which belongs to the outstanding ethnographic works about 19th-century Iran.

CAPRI model,"The CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact) model is a tool for ex-ante impact assessment of agricultural and international trade policies with a focus on the European Union. As an economic partial comparative static equilibrium model for agriculture, its core consists of two interlinked modules: the supply module, covering about 280 regional aggregate programming models covering the EU27, Norway and Western Balkans at the NUTS 2 level and the market module, a global spatial multi-commodity model for about 50 agricultural commodities, which together allow calculation of a wide range of economic and environmental indicators. A spatial downscaling component allows impact assessment at the 1x1 km grid level for EU27. CAPRI is written in GAMS and steered by a Graphical User Interface realized in Java.
CAPRI was developed and improved in a suite of EU funded research projects (CAPRI, CAP-STRAT, CAPRI-Dynaspat). Past applications include analysis of different reform steps of the Common Agricultural Policy such as Agenda 2000, Decoupling (2003) or sugar market reform (2005-2006) and environmental impact analysis such as a trading scheme for Green House Gases from agriculture.

Network
CAPRI is maintained by a network of different European research institutions and managed by teams from Institute for Food and Resource Economics at the University of Bonn, Agrifood Economics Centre at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Johann Heinrich von Thünen Institute in Braunschweig, Germany, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, NIBIO Oslo, Norway and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. Its main client is the EU Commission (Directorate-Generals for Agriculture and Rural Development and for the Environment).

Bruck an der Leitha,"Bruck an der Leitha (Central Bavarian: Bruck aun da Leitha; ""Bridge on the Leitha"") is a town in the Austrian state of Lower Austria on the border of Burgenland, marked by the Leitha river. In 2018 it had a population of around 8,000.

History
In and around Bruck parts of Neolithic tools were found, which makes it likely that there was a settlement there at that time. In Roman time, there was the crossing of two major roads, one of them being the Amber Road, the other a link to the Via Militaris. The important Roman army camp Carnuntum was located only ten miles northeast of Bruck at the Amber Road. In Bruck a Roman  fortification is said to have been at the place of ""Schloss Prugg"" (castle of Duke Harrach), of which one part still is named ""Roman Tower"" (though being built in the Middle Ages).
After the end of the Roman Empire, the first traces of new settlement date from around 900. Graves from this time show Hungarian and later Francian/Bavarian influence. In 1074 the settlement is first documented as ""Aschirichesprucca"" and elevated to the status of a city in 1239. During the 13th century Bruck was rebuilt according to a rectangular street-scheme north-east of the old settlement.
Though quite strongly fortified since, Bruck never played an important role in a military conflict. In the long period of wars with the Turkish Empire the fortifications were already outdated, so Bruck did not even try to resist Turkish troops when they approached Vienna in 1529 and 1683 (Siege of Vienna). Therefore, Bruck was not destroyed (unlike other towns like Hainburg).
After this period, Bruck prospered and became an important center of wine production and trade. In the Napoleonic Wars Bruck was a center of maneuvers for the Austrian army, which it remained during the 19th century. In 1867 an important permanent military base was erected. After the end of World War I in 1918 the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up. Most of Bruck belonged to Austria, but the military base and the main railway station was situated on the Hungarian side of the border (this part of Bruck is called Bruckneudorf).
This border, symbolised by the river Leitha, separated the Austrian Empire from the Kingdom of Hungary (Cisleithania and Transleithania). 
In 1921, when the western parts of Hungary were integrated to Austrian territory under the name of ""Burgenland"", Bruck remained divided between the provinces of Lower Austria and Burgenland. Bruck an der Leitha became the capital of the same-named district. Despite the important military base neighbouring Bruck, the town was not much affected by World War II. Today, Bruck has about 7300 inhabitants and still is the administrative center of the district. Important sights are the city walls from the 13th century, the Baroque church and the old castle, Schloss Prugg, of the Dukes of Harrach.
Today, the town is prospering in the energy department. It has nearby a large wind farm (possibly 60MW), which generates all the electricity for the town",history
Footvolley,"Footvolley (Portuguese: Futevôlei [futʃiˈvolej] in Brazil, Futevólei [ˌfutɨˈvɔlɐj] in Portugal) (first known as pevoley) is a sport that combines aspects of beach volleyball and association football.
Similar to Kick Volleyball and Futnet.
Footvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965 in Brazil. Footvolley combines field rules that are based on those of beach volleyball with ball-touch rules taken from association football. Essentially footvolley is beach volleyball except players are not allowed to use their hands and a football replaces the volleyball.

History
Footvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965 in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach. The game of footvolley was first called 'pévolei', pé=foot and vôlei=volley, but that name was discarded in favor of ""futevôlei"". (Cf. Portuguese futebol, ""association football"".) Footvolley started in Rio de Janeiro, according to one player because football was banned on the beach, but volleyball courts were open. The sport had spread to Recife, Salvador, Brasília, Goiânia, Santos, and Florianópolis by the 1970s.

Teams of footvolley had five aside at first. Due to the skill level of the footvolley athletes (nearly all were professional football players), the ball would rarely drop. The players began lowering the number of players on each side, eventually settling on 2 versus 2, which is still in use today.
In recent years, professional football players have taken up footvolley in both promotional events and celebrity matches. Some notable Brazilian footballers who have played (or still play) footvolley are Romário, Edmundo, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho Gaúcho, Júnior, Renato Gaúcho and Edinho (1982 & 1986 National Team).
The first International Footvolley event to occur outside of Brazil was in 2003 by the United States Footvolley Association on Miami Beach at the 2003 Fitness Festival. This event led to international players and teams in pursuit of federation status. A tournament was held during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, as a demonstration sport.

"History of Chincoteague, Virginia","The history of human activity in Chincoteague, on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, begins with the Native Americans. Until European explorers possessed the island in the late 17th century, the Chincoteague Indians used it as a place to gather shellfish, but are not known to have lived there; Chincoteague Island lacked suitable soil for their agriculture. The island's name derives from those early visitors: by one popular tale, chincoteague meant ""Beautiful land across the water"" in their language. 
Use of Chincoteague Island by European settlers began in the 17th century, when the island was granted to a Virginia colonist. Legal disputes followed, and it was not until 1691 that title was determined by the courts. Although a few people were living on the island by 1700, it was primarily used as a place to graze livestock. This was probably the origin of the Chincoteague ponies, feral horses that long roamed in the area. They are no longer present in the wild on Chincoteague Island. During the American Revolutionary War, the islanders supported the new nation's bid for independence. The local seafood resources began to be systematically exploited in the early 19th century.
In the American Civil War, the islanders supported the Union despite being located in a seceded state, and the war touched Chincoteague only lightly. Oysters became a major industry in the postwar years. Chincoteague's relative isolation ended in 1876 with the arrival of the railroad at Franklin City, Virginia, across Chincoteague Bay from the island, and the initiation of a dedicated steamboat service between the two settlements. Nevertheless, contemporary visitors found Chincoteague primitive. Part of the island was incorporated as the Town of Chincoteague within Accomack County in 1908; the municipality annexed the remainder of the island in 1989. Road traffic could reach the island with the completion of a causeway in 1922. Two devastating fires in that decade caused the establishment of the Chincoteague Fire Department in 1925; the new volunteer company took over the traditional pony penning, and soon had ponies from nearby Assateague Island swim the narrow channel between the two islands as part of that roundup. The carnival, pony swim, and subsequent auction constitute a highlight of the town's calendar, attracting tens of thousands to the island.
The seafood and poultry industries thrived through much of the 20th century, but neither is important to the island's economy today. Chincoteague is a major tourist destination on Virginia's Eastern Shore, with many coming to enjoy the beaches on Assateague Island. The success of Marguerite Henry's 1947 children's book Misty of Chincoteague and its sequels helped publicize Chincoteague, as did the 1961 film Misty.

Setting and Native American use
Chincoteague is the name of a town, and the barrier island on which it is located, on Virginia's Eastern Shore, in the United States. The island is about 8 miles (13 km) long and 2 miles (",history
Representative sequences,"In social sciences and other domains, representative sequences are whole sequences that best characterize or summarize a set of sequences. In bioinformatics, representative sequences also designate substrings of a sequence that characterize the sequence.

Social sciences
In Sequence analysis in social sciences, representative sequences are used to summarize sets of sequences describing for example the family life course or professional career of several thousands individuals.
The identification of representative sequences proceeds from the pairwise dissimilarities between sequences. One typical solution is the medoid sequence, i.e., the observed sequence that minimizes the sum of its distances to all other sequences in the set. An other solution is the densest observed sequence, i.e., the sequence with the greatest number of other sequences in its neighborhood. When the diversity of the sequences is large, a single representative is often insufficient to efficiently characterize the set. In such cases, an as small as possible set of representative sequences covering (i.e., which includes in at least one neighborhood of a representative) a given percentage of all sequences is searched.
A solution also considered is to select the medoids of relative frequency groups. More specifically, the method consists in sorting the sequences (for example, according to the first principal coordinate of the pairwise dissimilarity matrix), splitting the sorted list into equal sized groups (called relative frequency groups), and selecting the medoids of the equal sized groups.
The methods for identifying representative sequences described above have been implemented in the R package TraMineR.

Bioinformatics
Representative sequences are short regions within protein sequences that can be used to approximate the evolutionary relationships of those proteins, or the organisms from which they come. Representative sequences are contiguous subsequences (typically 300 residues) from ubiquitous, conserved proteins, such that each orthologous family of representative sequences taken alone gives a distance matrix in close agreement with the consensus matrix.

Use
Protein sequences can provide data about the biological function and evolution of proteins and protein domains. Grouping and interrelating protein sequences can therefore provide information about both human biological processes, and the evolutionary development of biological processes on earth; such sequence clusters allow for the effective coverage of sequence space. Sequence clusters can reduce a large database of sequences to a smaller set of sequence representatives, each of which should represent its cluster at the sequence level. Sequence representatives allow the effective coverage of the original database with fewer sequences. The database of sequence representatives is called non-redundant, as similar (or redundant) sequences have been removed at a certain similarity threshold.

History of business architecture,"The history of business architecture has its origins in the 1980s. In the next decades business architecture has developed into a discipline of ""cross-organizational design of the business as a whole"" closely related to enterprise architecture. The concept of business architecture has been proposed as a blueprint of the enterprise, as a business strategy, and also as the representation of a business design.
The concept of business architecture has evolved over the years. It was introduced in the 1980s as architectural domains and as an activity of business design. In the 2000s the study and concept development of business architecture accelerated. By the end of the 2000s the first handbooks on business architecture were published, separate frameworks for business architecture were being developed, separate views and models for business architecture were further under construction, the business architect as a profession evolved, and more businesses added business architecture to their agenda.
By 2015 business architecture has evolved into a common practice. The business architecture body of knowledge has been developed and is updated multiple times each year, and the interest from the academic world and from top management is growing.

Overview
Business architecture has its roots in traditional cross-organizational design. Bodine and Hilty (2009) stipulated, that the ""responsibility for the cross-organizational design of the business as a whole, the work of the Business Architect, has historically fallen to the CEO or their assignee, supported by generalist management consulting firms whose teams of MBAs work with corporate managers to transform strategy into new business configurations using the newest tools."" John Zachman (2012) commented in this context, that ""a lot of material has been written about business architecture (by some definition), going back to The Principles of Scientific Management (1911) by Frederick Taylor.""
One of the roots of business architecture lies in the proposals for enterprise architecture made since the 1980s and 1990s. Bernus & Noran (2010) distinguished two types of proposals. On the one hand ""Proposals that created generally applicable ‘blueprints’ (later to be called reference models, partial models...) so that the activities involved in the creation (or the change) of the enterprise could refer to such a common model (or set of models)."" And on the other hand ""proposals which claimed that to be able to organise the creation, and later the change, of enterprises one needs to understand the life cycle of the enterprise and of its parts... the ‘Enterprise Reference Architecture’.""
More specific about the emerge of business architecture Whelan & Meaden (2012) described, that this emerged against a backdrop of change. The business architecture is ""maturing into a discipline in its own right, rising from the pool of inter-related practices that include business strategy, enterprise architecture, business portfolio plan",science

Economics of networks,"Economics of networks is a discipline in the fields of economics and network sciences. It is primarily concerned with the understanding of economic phenomena by using network concepts and the tools of network science. Prominent authors in the field include Sanjeev Goyal, Matthew O. Jackson, and Rachel Kranton.
This term should not be confused with network economics or network externality.

Models of networked markets
The concept of networks enables a better understanding of the functioning of markets. On the border of network science and market theory, several models have emerged to explain different aspects in markets.

Exchange theory
Exchange theory explains how economic transactions, trade in favor, communication of information, or other exchanges are affected by the structure of the relationships among the involved participants. The main idea is that the act of exchange is influenced by the agents’ opportunities and their environment. For example, the position of a given agent in the network can endorse them with the power in the auctions and deals they make with their partners.

Bilateral Trading Models
As part of exchange theory, bilateral trading models consider sellers and buyers. These models use game-theoretic models of bargaining in networks to help predict the behavior of agents depending on the type of network. The outcome of transactions can be determined by, for instance, the number of sellers a buyer is connected to, or vice versa (Corominas-Bosch model). Another case occurs when the agents agree on a transaction through an auction and their decision-making during the auction depends on the link structure. Kranton and Minehart concluded that if markets were considered networks, it would enable sellers to pool uncertainty in demand. Building links is costly, however, due to trade-offs not all links are necessary for the network, resulting in a sparse, efficiency-enhancing network.

Informal exchange
The study of networks in economics started before the development of network science. Károly Polány, Claude Lévi-Strauss, and Bronislaw Malinowski studied tribes where complicated gift exchange mechanisms constructed networks between groups, such as families or islands. Although modern trade systems differ fundamentally, such systems based on reciprocity can still survive and reciprocity-based or personalized exchange deals persist even when a market would be more efficient. According to Kranton, informal exchange can exist in networks if transactions are more reciprocal than market-based. In this case, market exchange is hard to find and is associated with high search costs, therefore yielding low utility. Personalized exchange agreements ensure the possibility of long-term agreements.

Scale-free property and economics
Recent studies have tried to examine the deeper connection between socio-economic factors and phenomena and the scale-free property. They found that business networks have scale-free property and that the merger among ",economics
Goulash Communism,"Goulash Communism (Hungarian: gulyáskommunizmus), also known as refrigerator communism (Hungarian: fridzsiderkommunizmus), Kádárism or the Hungarian Thaw, is the variety of state socialism in the Hungarian People's Republic following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. During János Kádár's period of leadership, the Hungarian People's Republic implemented policies with the goal to create a high standard of living for the people of Hungary coupled with economic reforms. These reforms fostered a sense of well-being and relative cultural freedom in Hungary, giving it the reputation of being ""the happiest barracks"" of the Eastern Bloc during the 1960s to the 1970s. With elements of regulated market economics as well as an improved human rights record, it represented a quiet reform and deviation from the Stalinist principles applied to Hungary in the previous decade.
The name is a metaphor derived from goulash, a traditional Hungarian dish. Goulash is made with an assortment of dissimilar ingredients; here, it represents how Hungarian communism became a mixed ideology, no longer strictly adhering to the Marxist–Leninist interpretations of the prior decade. Nikita Khrushchev was the first to use the term when he wanted to highlight Hungary's economic developments. This period of ""pseudo-consumerism"" saw an increase of consumption of consumer goods as well. During the Kádár era, Hungary became the most consumption-oriented country of the Eastern Bloc, with the highest standard of living.
The phrase ""the happiest barracks"" was coined in the 1970s to describe the socialist state during this period, though it was also used to describe Poland. The word ""happiest"" referred to the Hungarian People's Republic having the highest standard of living of all the Soviet-bloc countries. It was the easiest place to travel abroad and the quickest to get access to Western products and culture. The country, however, remained under firm party control.

Origins
Hungarian Revolution of 1956
The historical events leading to and including the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 created an atmosphere for Goulash Communism to commence. Mátyás Rákosi headed the Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP) until shortly before its demise in the 1956 revolution, modelling Hungarian Communism after the regime of Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union. In that sense, he helped implement an extensive industrialization of the country. While the quick change to industry brought an initial surge of the economy, it ultimately left many people with worse living conditions. In 1951 the Hungarian people had to use a ticket system to purchase basic supplies. After the death of Stalin in 1953, the Soviet Union supported a change in leadership in Hungary and recommended Imre Nagy for the position of Prime Minister. Nagy took steps in his government towards ""political liberalization"", which drove Rákosi, a staunch Stalinist, to oust him from office in 1955. Imre Nagy did come back and lead the government during the",politics
Angel-shaped phalango-epiphyseal dysplasia,"Angel-shaped phalango-epiphyseal dysplasia, also known as peripheral dysostosis, is a rare type of osteochondrodysplasia which is characterized by angel-shaped middle phalanges of the fingers and generalized metaphyseal dysplasia/delayed osseous age. Additional findings include joint hypermobility, hypodontia, and hip osteoarthritis. According to OMIM, 10 cases from multiple families have been described in medical literature. It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. According to ORPHA, 20 cases have been reported.

Presentation
The middle phalanges' (often those of the 2nd, 3rd and 5th digits of the hands) angel shape is caused by an abnormal development of the epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis of said phalanges; the wings are formed by an abnormal dyaphysis, the angel's skirt is from a cone-shaped epiphysis, and the head is formed by an abnormal distal pseudoepophysis.

Genetics
This disorder is thought to be caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the GDF5 gene, in chromosome 20.

History
This condition was first discovered in 1967, by Bachman et al. when he described a ""hereditary peripheral dysostosis"" on one woman and 2 of her children.

Eponym
This disorder's name comes from the fact that Bachman et al. (the researchers who originally described the disorder) and Giedion et al. missed a characteristic feature that the people diagnosed with the disorder shared: a middle phalange that had a striking resemblance to the shape of decorative angels of small size that are often put in Christmas trees.

Kutjevo Abbey,"Kutjevo Abbey, also known as Gotó (Latin: Vallis honesta de Gotho) was a Cistercian monastery in what is now Croatia, in the area of Slavonia, 23 km north-east of Požega.

History
The monastery was founded in 1232 as a daughter-house of Zirc Abbey in Hungary, of the filiation of Clairvaux. The Cistercians planted the vineyards, which are still cultivated today. After the Turkish attack of 1521 (or 1529), the monastery was dissolved and subsequently destroyed.
In 1689, the monastery estate was granted by Emperor Leopold I to Ivan Babić, a canon of Zagreb, who was named titular abbot. In 1698, the site was re-settled by the Jesuits, who remained there until 1773. In 1882, the property was acquired by Vjenceslav Turković and Franjo Türk, who developed a significant wine production on it. After World War II, this was conducted as a Socialist enterprise.

Buildings and precinct
The existing building complex was built by the Jesuits in the 18th century on the ruins of the Cistercian monastery. The former monastery church, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, still stands.

Samhällsvetenskapsprogrammet,"Education in Sweden is mandatory for children between ages 5/6 and 15/16 depending on when in the year they were born. The school year in Sweden runs from mid-late August to early/mid-June. The Christmas holiday from mid-December to early January divides the Swedish school year into two terms.
Preschool is free for all families. The year children turn six they start the compulsory preschool class (förskoleklass), which acts as a transition phase between preschool and comprehensive schools. Children between ages 5/6 and 15/16 attend comprehensive school where a wide range of subjects are studied. All students study the same subjects, with exception for different language choices. The majority of schools are run municipally, but there are also privately owned schools, known as independent schools.
Almost all students continue studying in three-year-long upper secondary schools where most students choose one out of 18 national programmes, some of which are vocational and some preparatory. For students not fulfilling the requirements for the national programmes, introductory programmes are available where students work to satisfy the requirements for the national programmes. In 2018, 16% of students finishing year 9 of comprehensive school were not eligible for national programmes.
The higher education system is compatible with the rest of Europe through the Bologna Process where degrees are divided into three cycles: basic level, advanced level and doctoral level. There are two degrees available in each cycle of different lengths. Universities have no tuition fees for Swedish citizens (as well for citizens of European Economic Area сountries), and student aid is available from the government.

History
According to Lars Petterson, the number of students grew slowly, 1900–1947, then shot up rapidly in the 1950s, and declined after 1962. The pattern of birth rates was a major factor. In addition Petterson points to the opening up of the gymnasium from a limited upper social base to the general population based on talent. In addition he points to the role of central economic planning, the widespread emphasis on education as a producer of economic growth and the expansion of white collar jobs. During the nineteenth century, as demand for education increased, more women entered the teaching force in many Western countries, including Sweden. By 1900, 66 percent of Sweden's teachers were women, many of whom worked in isolated rural areas.

Primary school
In 1842, the Swedish parliament enacted the first national school act for primary schooling. While it did not make schooling compulsory for children, it made it mandatory for parishes to establish at least one primary school (folkskola). These primary school provided a basic education, focusing on reading, writing, math and religious knowledge. During the latter half of the nineteenth century, an increasing number of children attended these schools, and by the turn of the century most children atten",science
Co-option,"Co-option, also known as co-optation and sometimes spelt cooption or cooptation, is a term with three common meanings. It may refer to:
1) The process of adding members to an elite group at the discretion of members of the body, usually to manage opposition and so maintain the stability of the group. Outsiders are ""co-opted"" by being given a degree of power on the grounds of their elite status, specialist knowledge, or potential ability to threaten essential commitments or goals (""formal co-optation"").  Co-optation may take place in many other contexts, such as a technique by a dictatorship to control opposition.
2) The process by which a group subsumes or acculturates a smaller or weaker group with related interests, or the process by which one group gains converts from another group by replicating some aspects of it without adopting the full program or ideal (""informal co-optation""). Co-optation is associated with the cultural tactic of recuperation, and is often understood to be synonymous with it.
3) A procedural mechanism where existing members of a legislative body, corporate board, or the like invite or elect additional members to join them, such as in British local government until 1972. This may be the mechanism by which one of the first two process occur.

First sense
In a 1979 article for Harvard Business Review, consultants John Kotter and Leonard Schlesinger presented co-optation as a ""form of manipulation"" for dealing with employees who are resistant to new management programs:

Co-opting an individual usually involves giving him or her a desirable role in the design or implementation of the change. Co-opting a group involves giving one of its leaders, or someone it respects, a key role in the design or implementation of a change. This is not a form of participation, however, because the initiators do not want the advice of the co-opted, merely his or her endorsement.

Reasons for use
Two common uses of co-option are firstly, to recruit members who have specific skills or abilities needed by the group which are not available among existing members. Secondly, to fill vacancies which could not be filled by the usual process (normally election), e.g. if suitable candidates appear subsequently.  Co-opted members may or may not have the same rights as the elected members of a group (such as the right to vote on motions), depending on the rules of the group. Sociologist William Gamson defined co-optation as ""challengers gaining access to the public policy process but without achieving actual policy changes.""

Limitations on use
If a group is elected or appointed based on its members representing specific constituencies, co-option to fill vacancies is inappropriate, as a member selected by existing members will not necessarily represent the interests of the group represented by the vacating member.  In this case, vacancies may be filled via a mechanism specified in its rules, such as a by-election.  Examples are:

Ideological repression,"Ideological repression refers to forceful activities against competing ideologies and philosophies.
Alan Wolfe defines ideological repression as ""the attempt to manipulate people's consciousness so they accept the ruling ideology, and distrust and refuse to be moved by competing ideologies"".
In the early days of the Soviet Union and in other countries, ideological repression was carried out by political repression of the carriers of competing ideologies.
Instruments of ideological repression are propaganda and censorship. During the days of ""Marxism–Leninism"" in the Soviet Union – around the early 1930s – students of this particular school of thought were given textbooks that encouraged one particular way of thinking (the Marxist way) as being paramount and the most scientific and true school of thought.
Through ideological repression and control of output information, the Soviet Union was attempting to keep social revolutions at bay.

Motograph News Bulletin,"The Motograph News Bulletin, also known as the Zipper, was a 380-feet-long electromechanical news ticker display that wrapped around One Times Square.

History
Development and installation
Frank C. Reilly and Francis EJ Wilde, both engineers at Motogram, developed the technology used in the display. While similar illuminated displays existed at the time, they all had disadvantages. Wilde patented many devices which helped overcome these shortcomings.
In 1926, Reilly proposed the idea of installing a news ticker bulletin on the Times Tower to the owner of the New York Times Adolph Ochs and deputy Arthur Hays Sulzberger. They all signed a contract July 26, 1928.
It took 8 weeks to install the display with work being done 24 hours a day in order to meet the contracted deadline. The Times wanted to pay a maximum of $50,000 but due to the fact it was unique and custom manufactured along with several difficulties unforeseen during the installation process, Motogram ended up paying $80,000 for it. This led to increased animosity between the two companies.
The first headline displayed was the announcement of Herbert Hoover's victory over Al Smith on November 6, 1928. The display read: HOOVER DEFEATS AL SMITH.
The New York Times wrote and published an article, titled HUGE TIMES SIGN WILL FLASH NEWS, describing the device.

Subsequent history
The Motograph quickly became an icon of New York City. It appeared in many films of the time.
On May 18, 1942, it was extinguished for the first time in history in order to comply with the black-out orders given by the military.
On the morning of August 14, 1945 at 07:30 (EST), the following message was displayed on the Motograph: ***OFFICIAL - TRUMAN ANNOUNCES JAPANESE SURRENDER***. James Torpey, the person responsible for composing the headlines and general operation, had spent nearly a day in order to make sure the headline was correct. He came up with the idea of adding 3 stars to the beginning and end of the headline which represented the 3 branches of the American armed forces. Almost 750,000 people crowded around the building to read the headline, the largest audience the Motograph would ever see likely due to the proliferation of television.
The Motograph operated continuously until 1961, when the Times moved out of the building. The tower was subsequently purchased by Allied Chemical in 1963. The display was put back into service in 1965 but would only operate sporadically, with some gaps lasting several years.
In 1975, the Motograph was extinguished. Newsday rented the display in 1980, putting it back into service once more. However, in December 1994, Newsday announced the lease would terminate at the end of the month citing profitability with Chiara Coletti commenting ""Frankly, there's not that much bang for the buck.""

Replacement
The Motograph was eventually replaced by a new display in 1997, utilizing 227,200 amber LEDs. The headlines are currently sourced from The Wall Street Journal.

Kinetic exchange models of markets,"Kinetic exchange models are multi-agent dynamic models inspired by the statistical physics of energy distribution, which try to explain the robust and universal features of income/wealth distributions.
Understanding the distributions of income and wealth in an economy has been a classic problem in economics for more than a hundred years. Today it is one of the main branches of econophysics.

Data and basic tools
In 1897, Vilfredo Pareto first found a universal feature in the distribution of wealth. After that, with some notable exceptions, this field had been dormant for many decades, although accurate data had been accumulated over this period.  Considerable investigations with the real data during the last fifteen years (1995–2010) revealed that the tail (typically 5 to 10 percent of agents in any country) of the income/wealth distribution indeed follows a power law. However, the majority of the population (i.e., the low-income population) follows a different distribution which is debated to be either Gibbs or log-normal.
Basic tools used in this type of modelling are probabilistic and statistical methods mostly taken from the kinetic theory of statistical physics. Monte Carlo simulations often come handy in solving these models.

Overview of the models
Since the distributions of income/wealth are the results of the interaction among many heterogeneous agents, there is an analogy with statistical mechanics, where many particles interact. This similarity was noted by Meghnad Saha and B. N. Srivastava in 1931 and thirty years later by Benoit Mandelbrot. In 1986, an elementary version of the stochastic exchange model was first proposed by J. Angle. for open online view only. 
In the context of kinetic theory of gases, such an exchange model was first investigated by A. Dragulescu and V. Yakovenko. Later, scholars found that in 1988, Bennati had independently introduced the same kinetic exchange dynamics, thus leading to the nomenclature of this model as Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko (BDY) game. The main modelling efforts since then have been put to introduce the concepts of savings, and taxation in the setting of an ideal gas-like system. Basically, it assumes that in the short-run, an economy remains conserved in terms of income/wealth; therefore law of conservation for income/wealth can be applied. Millions of such conservative transactions lead to a steady state distribution of money (gamma function-like in the Chakraborti-Chakrabarti model with uniform savings, and a gamma-like bulk distribution ending with a Pareto tail in the Chatterjee-Chakrabarti-Manna model with distributed savings) and the distribution converges to it. The distributions derived thus have close resemblance with those found in empirical cases of income/wealth distributions.
Though this theory had been originally derived from the entropy maximization principle of statistical mechanics, it had been shown by A. S. Chakrabarti and B. K. Chakrabarti  that the same could be deriv",economics

History of biochemistry,"The history of biochemistry can be said to have started with the ancient Greeks who were interested in the composition and processes of life, although biochemistry as a specific scientific discipline has its beginning around the early 19th century. Some argued that the beginning of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first enzyme, diastase (today called amylase), in 1833 by Anselme Payen, while others considered Eduard Buchner's first demonstration of a complex biochemical process alcoholic fermentation in cell-free extracts to be the birth of biochemistry. Some might also point to the influential work of Justus von Liebig from 1842, Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology, which presented a chemical theory of metabolism, or even earlier to the 18th century studies on fermentation and respiration by Antoine Lavoisier.
The term biochemistry itself is derived from the combining form bio-, meaning 'life', and chemistry. The word is first recorded in English in 1848, while in 1877, Felix Hoppe-Seyler used the term (Biochemie in German) in the foreword to the first issue of Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) as a synonym for physiological chemistry and argued for the setting up of institutes dedicate to its studies. Nevertheless, several sources cite German chemist Carl Neuberg as having coined the term for the new discipline in 1903, and some credit it to Franz Hofmeister.
The subject of study in biochemistry is the chemical processes in living organisms, and its history involves the discovery and understanding of the complex components of life and the elucidation of pathways of biochemical processes.  Much of biochemistry deals with the structures and functions of cellular components such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids and other biomolecules; their metabolic pathways and flow of chemical energy through metabolism; how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells; it also focuses on the biochemical processes involved in the control of information flow through biochemical signalling, and how they relate to the functioning of whole organisms. Over the last 40 years the field has had success in explaining living processes such that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine are engaged in biochemical research.
Among the vast number of different biomolecules, many are complex and large molecules (called polymers), which are composed of similar repeating subunits (called monomers). Each class of polymeric biomolecule has a different set of subunit types. For example, a protein is a polymer whose subunits are selected from a set of twenty or more amino acids, carbohydrates are formed from sugars known as monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides, lipids are formed from fatty acids and glycerols, and nucleic acids are formed from nucleotides.

Spatial turn,"Spatial turn is an Intellectual Movement that places emphasis on place and space in social science and the humanities. It is closely linked with quantitative studies of history, literature, cartography, geography, and other studies of society. The movement has been influential in providing and analyzing mass amounts of spatial data for study of cultures, regions, and specific locations. An important aspect is the realisation that the spatial environment not only provides a physical background for historical and social developments, but also helps to shape them. According to this understanding, spaces are also constructed through social interactions and also shape these in turn.

History
Academics such as German philosopher Ernst Cassirer and American historian Lewis Mumford helped to define a sense of ""community"" and ""commons"" in their studies, forming the first part of a ""spatial turn."" The turn developed more comprehensively in the later 20th century in French academic theories, such as those of Michel Foucault. 
Technologies have also played an important role in ""turns."" The introduction of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has also been instrumental in quantifying data in the humanities for study by its place. In the 21st century, the increasing availability of smaller scale geographic data tracking individuals through mobile phones has led the spatial turn to spawn the mobilities turn which focuses on the movement of people, ideas, and things through space.

Economy of Sikkim,"The economy of Sikkim, a state in northeastern India, has a significantly agricultural economy. Although having mountainous terrain, Sikkim has managed to sustain its agricultural economy through organic farming. The state of Sikkim was declared as the only 100 per cent organic state in 2016. Sikkim's industrial sector is also mostly agriculture based. Besides agriculture, other large industries include pharmaceuticals, ecotourism, and carpet weaving.

Economy
In 2016, Sikkim became the world's first organic state, implementing 100% organic policy. A majority of Sikkim's population is employed in agriculture, forestry, and fishing, with 80% of the rural population employed in this sector.
In 2003, Sikkim implemented 100% Organic farming and banned chemical fertilizers and pesticides, becoming the first Indian state to do so. In January 2016, Sikkim was awarded with the Future Policy Gold Award by UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
Sikkim is the major producer of Black cardamom in India, accounting for 88% of all cardamom produced in the country. Other major crops of the state include paddy, buckwheat, maize, barley, tea, and potatoes. Sikkim is known for its unique Temi Tea, something which the Tea Board of India is considering for a geographical indication tag.
2. Tourism: Tourism remains a pillar of Sikkim's economy. Adventure tourism, ecotourism, and cultural tourism have drawn both domestic and international visitors. In 2023-24, the state focuses on sustainable tourism to preserve its fragile ecology, while promoting its serene landscapes, Buddhist monasteries, and trekking routes.
3. Hydropower: Sikkim has abundant water resources, and hydropower projects continue to drive its economy. With significant potential for power generation, the state sells surplus electricity to other regions in India. These projects generate revenue, employment, and infrastructure development.
4.Pharmaceuticals: The pharmaceutical sector has emerged as a key player in Sikkim’s industrial growth. Global companies, attracted by the state's investor-friendly policies and tax incentives, have set up plants in the region. This sector contributes substantially to state GDP and provides employment opportunities.
Challenges and Outlook:
Despite its positive growth trajectory, Sikkim faces challenges, including environmental degradation, climate change impacts, and limited infrastructural connectivity. However, with ongoing efforts to improve connectivity through road, rail, and air networks, and a strong focus on sustainable development, Sikkim’s economy in 2023-24 looks promising.

Perceptual control theory,"Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a model of behavior based on the properties of negative feedback control loops. A control loop maintains a sensed variable at or near a reference value by means of the effects of its outputs upon that variable, as mediated by physical properties of the environment. In engineering control theory, reference values are set by a user outside the system. An example is a thermostat. In a living organism, reference values for controlled perceptual variables are endogenously maintained. Biological homeostasis and reflexes are simple, low-level examples. The discovery of mathematical principles of control introduced a way to model a negative feedback loop closed through the environment (circular causation), which spawned perceptual control theory. It differs fundamentally from some models in behavioral and cognitive psychology that model stimuli as causes of behavior (linear causation). PCT research is published in experimental psychology, neuroscience, ethology, anthropology, linguistics, sociology, robotics, developmental psychology, organizational psychology and management, and a number of other fields. PCT has been applied to design and administration of educational systems, and has led to a psychotherapy called the method of levels.

Principles and differences from other theories
The perceptual control theory is deeply rooted in biological cybernetics, systems biology and control theory and the related concept of feedback loops. Unlike some models in behavioral and cognitive psychology it sets out from the concept of circular causality. It shares, therefore, its theoretical foundation with the concept of plant control, but it is distinct from it by emphasizing the control of the internal representation of the physical world.
The plant control theory focuses on neuro-computational processes of movement generation, once a decision for generating the movement has been taken. PCT spotlights the embeddedness of agents in their environment. Therefore, from the perspective of perceptual control, the central problem of motor control consists in finding a sensory input to the system that matches a desired perception.

History
PCT has roots in physiological insights of Claude Bernard and in 20th century in the research by Walter B. Cannon and in the fields of control systems engineering and cybernetics. Classical negative feedback control was worked out by engineers in the 1930s and 1940s, and further developed by Wiener, Ashby, and others in the early development of the field of cybernetics. Beginning in the 1950s, William T. Powers applied the concepts and methods of engineered control systems to biological control systems, and developed the experimental methodology of PCT.
A key insight of PCT is that the controlled variable is not the output of the system (the behavioral actions), but its input, that is, a sensed and transformed function of some state of the environment that the control system's output can affect. Because",science
History of the Alps,"The valleys of the Alps have been inhabited since prehistoric times. The Alpine culture, which developed there, centers on transhumance.
Currently the Alps are divided among eight countries: France, Monaco, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany and Slovenia. In 1991 the Alpine Convention was established to regulate this transnational area, whose area measures about 190,000 square kilometres (73,000 sq mi).

Early history (before 1200)
The Wildkirchli caves in the Appenzell Alps show traces of Neanderthal habitation (about 40,000 BCE). During the Würm glaciation (up to c. 11700 BP), the entire Alps were covered in ice.
Anatomically modern humans reach the Alpine region by c. 30,000 years ago. MtDNA Haplogroup K (believed to have originated in the mid-Upper Paleolithic, between about 30,000 and 22,000 years ago, with an estimated age here of c. 12,000 years BP), is a genetic marker associated with southeastern Alpine region.
Traces of transhumance appear in the Neolithic. In the Bronze Age, the Alps formed the boundary of the Urnfield and Terramare cultures.
The mummy found on the Ötztal Alps, known as ""Ötzi the Iceman"", lived c. 3200 BC. At that stage the population in its majority had already changed from an economy based on hunting and gathering to one based on agriculture and animal husbandry. It is still an open question whether forms of pastoral mobility, such as transhumance (alpiculture), already existed in prehistory.
The earliest historical accounts date to the Roman period, mostly due to Greco-Roman ethnography, with some epigraphic evidence due to the Raetians, Lepontii and Gauls, with Ligurians and Venetii occupying the fringes in the south-west and south-east, respectively (Cisalpine Gaul) during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. 
The Rock Drawings in Valcamonica date to this period.  A few details have come down to modern scholars of the conquest of many of the Alpine tribes by Augustus, as well as Hannibal's battles across the Alps.
Most of the local Gallic tribes allied themselves with the Carthaginians in the Second Punic War, for the duration of which Rome lost control over most of Northern Italy. The Roman conquest of Italy was only complete after the Roman victory over Carthage, by the 190s BC.
Between 35 and 6 BC, the Alpine region was gradually integrated into the expanding Roman Empire. The contemporary monument Tropaeum Alpium in La Turbie celebrates the victory won by the Romans over 46 tribes in these mountains. The subsequent construction of roads over the Alpine passes first permitted southern and northern Roman settlements in the Alps to be connected, and eventually integrated the inhabitants of the Alps into the culture of the Empire. The upper Rhône Valley or Vallis Poenina fell to the Romans after a battle at Octodurus (Martigny) in 57 BC. Aosta was founded in 25 BC as Augusta Praetoria Salassorum in the former territory of the Salassi. Raetia was conquered in 15 BC.

History of Scania,"For hundreds of years up until the 18th century, the history of the province of Scania was marked by the struggle between the two Scandinavian kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden over the hegemony in the Baltic area.

Viking age
It was previously thought that society in Scania, like in the rest of Scandinavia, was made up of farmers mostly Fen farmers and cattle farmers, thralls, the farmer being free and equal, and having their say at the Things in the affairs of society. Archeological findings on Jutland, the Danish islands, and on the Scanian plains have modified this picture. It has now become clear that the distribution of wealth, at least from the early Migration Period, was very uneven. The plains were to a large extent divided up between large farms which were far bigger than smallholdings, and were often grouped in villages. Subsequently, only a small faction of the population can be presumed to have enjoyed full civic rights. It seems now more likely that this society ought to be perceived as a system of tribes, each led by chieftains, in Danish often called godes, whose authority depended on the size and wealth of the tribe. Scania had 5 main tribes each having had their own Thanes (leaders), and their own group of warriors, all under the command of the King of Scania.

After Christianization
It now seems likely that a period of domestic colonization within Scania that was earlier believed to have started before the Viking Age, in reality largely took place after the Viking Age, when donations of land to monasteries led to influences from Continental Europe. This led to a transition from a predominantly animal husbandry-based society to one of farming, which entailed extensive land clearing, possibly also connected with the liberation of the thralls, that led to the creation of many new settlements with names ending in -torp, -rup, and -rød.

Scania was first mentioned in written texts in the 8th century, stating that it was a part of Denmark. According to the Large Jelling Stone, Scanians, like all Danes were Christianized by the King of all Danes, Harald Bluetooth before this stone was raised, presumably around 985 AD.
The Scanian law, the oldest of the Medieval Scandinavian laws,  came into force in the beginning of the 13th century. It is remarkable in the sense that it exists written in both Latin letters (not in Latin though) as well as Runes, Codex runicus.
Already in 1060 was Dalby Church build by Svend Estridsen, as one of the first Danish churches made of stone. Between 1104 and 1536, Lund was the Archbishopric of Denmark, and the Danish National Banner, Dannebrog, was preserved in the Cathedral for several centuries.

In 1332 the king of Denmark, Christopher II, died as a ""king without a country"" after he and his older brother and predecessor had divided Denmark into much smaller polities. King Magnus IV of Sweden took advantage of his neighbour's distress, redeeming the eastern Danish provinces for a huge amount of silver, which",history

History of Benndorf (Frohburg),"Benndorf is a small village in Germany, first mentioned in 1216. It was independent until 1 January 1997 when Benndorf was incorporated into the city of Frohburg.

Former names
13th century
In 1216 in a document next to Henry the Younger and Henry the Elder of Corna (Kohren) and Siegfried of Zedtlitz also called a Hugo von Bennendorf as a witness, a knight whose ancestors under Wiprecht of Groitzsch were settled. They came from Franconia. There was also a village Benndorf, now Kaltenbrunn. A Gnanno of Benndorf to the monastery Benz more goods, a Adelbert is called by Benndorf as a witness. 1233 are named as owners of Benndorf Dither List and Siegfried List. The family moved to Windischleuba. With family List the number of those owners begins possessed the centuries Frohburg and Benndorf.

14th century
In 1350 has Gunegunde, the stern knight de Trenowe (of Thräna) wife, the Rödichen, freight and charges in Benndorf. 
Dietrich von List transfers in 1352, the patronage right on the church Benndorf the mountain monastery Chemnitz. In 1362 the Benndorf mill was built and first mentioned in 1365.

15th century
On June 28, 1413 borrows Markgraf Wilhelm II to the stern Apel and Michael Brothers of Bresen the Frohburg Castle, the grove behind the castle, the town Frohburg half, the neck Court in the villages Greifenhain, Eschefeld and Benndorf. For the year 1420 are in a buying bonds, which is located in the castle archive to Frohburg, as the owner of Benndorf Cunrad and Frutzsche (Fritz) called Bresen. They sold then to her cousin Caspar von Bresen on Frohburg a wood which called Borkisbach (Burkhardt Bach). In 1485 Johann sold by Bresen on Benndorf a piece of wood to Heinrich von Einsiedel in Gnandstein. 
Around the year 1500, the Benndorf church was built.

16th century

Caspar von Minkwitz met us on 1535 Benndorf. 1540 sold this Frohburg and Benndorf ""sessig on Kossern"" Nickel of Techwitz. This is on October 30, 1542 by the Ernestine Electors Johann Friedrich, in turn, by the bailiff of Altenburg, admonished to comply with its pecuniary obligations to the pastor of Benndorf.
Already in 1549 sold Nickel of Techwitz the manors Frohburg and Benndorf because overindebted, to Melchior von Kreutzen. The purchase contract is the Albertine Elector Moritz signed with. Melchior von Kreutzen died ""to Frohburg at his castle by Ursula, which was October 24, 1555 at 9:00 am,"" so now states that at the western porch of Frohburger Church brazen grave slab with Kreutzer almost life-size figure.

Homeokinetics,"Homeokinetics is the study of self-organizing, complex systems. Standard physics studies systems at separate levels, such as atomic physics, nuclear physics, biophysics, social physics, and galactic physics. Homeokinetic physics studies the up-down processes that bind these levels. Tools such as mechanics, quantum field theory, and the laws of thermodynamics provide the key relationships. The subject, described as the physics and thermodynamics associated with the up down movement between levels of systems, originated in the late 1970s work of American physicists Harry Soodak and Arthur Iberall. Complex systems are universes, galaxies, social systems, people, or even those that seem as simple as gases. The basic premise is that the entire universe consists of atomistic-like units bound in interactive ensembles to form systems, level by level, in a nested hierarchy. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.

History
Arthur Iberall, Warren McCulloch and Harry Soodak developed the concept of homeokinetics as a new branch of physics.  It began through Iberall's biophysical research for the NASA exobiology program into the dynamics of mammalian physiological processes They were observing an area that physics has neglected, that of complex systems with their very long internal factory day delays. They were observing systems associated with nested hierarchy and with an extensive range of time scale processes. It was such connections, referred to as both up-down or in-out connections (as nested hierarchy) and side-side or flatland physics among atomistic-like components (as heterarchy) that became the hallmark of homeokinetic problems. By 1975, they began to put a formal catch-phrase name on those complex problems, associating them with nature, life, human, mind, and society. The major method of exposition that they began using was a combination of engineering physics and a more academic pure physics. In 1981, Iberall was invited to the Crump Institute for Medical Engineering of UCLA, where he further refined the key concepts of homeokinetics, developing a physical scientific foundation for complex systems.

Self-organizing complex Systems
A system is a collective of interacting ‘atomistic’-like entities. The word ‘atomism’ is used to stand both for the entity and the doctrine. As is known from ‘kinetic’ theory, in mobile or simple systems, the atomisms share their ‘energy’ in interactive collisions. That so-called ‘equipartitioning’ process takes place within a few collisions. Physically, if there is little or no interaction, the process is considered to be very weak. Physics deals basically with the forces of interaction—few in number—that influence the interactions. They all tend to emerge with considerable force at high ‘density’ of atomistic interaction.

Informbiro period,"The Informbiro period was an era of Yugoslavia's history following the Tito–Stalin split in mid-1948 that lasted until the country's partial rapprochement with the Soviet Union in 1955 with the signing of the Belgrade declaration. After World War II in Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia's new leadership under Josip Broz Tito pursued a foreign policy that did not align with the Eastern Bloc. Eventually, this led to public conflict, but the Yugoslav leadership decided not to acquiesce to Soviet demands, despite significant external and internal pressures. The period saw the persecution of the political opposition in Yugoslavia, resulting in thousands being imprisoned, exiled, or sent to forced labour. 100 Yugoslav citizens were seriously wounded or killed between 1948 and 1953 while some sources claim 400 victims during the existence of Goli otok prison camp. The purges included a significant number of members of Yugoslavia's security apparatus and its military.
This break with the Eastern Bloc caused significant economic difficulties for Yugoslavia as the country relied on trade with the USSR and Soviet allies. Economic pressures within the country led to reforms that would ultimately result in the introduction of socialist self-management and increased decentralisation of the country through constitutional amendments formalising the reforms.
The United States saw the rift between the Eastern Bloc and Yugoslavia as an opportunity during the Cold War to fragment the Eastern Bloc further and consequently provided economic and military aid, loans, and diplomatic support to the country. The new foreign policy circumstances led Tito to end Yugoslav support of Communist forces in the Greek Civil War and concluded the Balkan Pact, an agreement of cooperation and defence with Greece and Turkey.
The period had an impact on Yugoslavia's contemporary art and popular culture, as artists were encouraged to seek inspiration in the wartime struggle of the Yugoslav Partisans and the construction of new infrastructure. Decades later, many literary works and films covered the era's events.
The descriptor ""Informbiro period"" arose from the Communist Information Bureau, an organisation initiated by Stalin that had aimed to reduce divergence among communist governments.

Background
Relations between Joseph Stalin and Josip Broz Tito were often strained during World War II as the Soviet Union and the Yugoslav Partisans, a resistance movement established following Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, pursued divergent interests other than defeating the Axis powers and promoting Communist ideas. Nonetheless, Soviet advisers arrived in Yugoslavia in the autumn of 1944 and promised economic and military assistance—specifically arms and aid to the defence industry. By February 1947, little aid had arrived. In September 1947, when the Soviets formed the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, also known as the Cominform, they insisted on headquartering it in the Yugoslav cap",history
Intertestamental period,"The intertestamental period (Protestant) or deuterocanonical period (Catholic and Eastern Orthodox) is the period of time between the events of the protocanonical books and the New Testament. It is considered to cover roughly 400 years, spanning from the ministry of Malachi (c. 420 BC) to the appearance of John the Baptist in the early 1st century AD. It is roughly contiguous with the Second Temple period (516 BC–70 AD) and encompasses the age of Hellenistic Judaism.
It is known by some Protestants as the ""400 Silent Years"" because it was a period when no new prophets were raised and God revealed nothing new to the Jewish people. Many of the deuterocanonical books, accepted as scripture by the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy, were written during this time, as were many pseudepigraphal works, the Biblical apocrypha and Jewish apocrypha. An understanding of the events of the intertestamental period provides historical and literary context for the New Testament.

Strategic urban planning,"Strategic Urban Planning (SUP) is a methodical approach aimed at shaping the future of urban areas. It involves setting clear objectives, coordinating public and private efforts, and adapting to new circumstances to enhance the living conditions of the affected citizens. SUP is not a new concept; it has been applied to various aspects of human activity, with notable figures such as Sun Tzu, Arthur Thomson, and Henry Mintzberg contributing to its development. 
Fifteen years of practice proved to be enough time for the technique to spread and for the first “Meeting of American and European cities for the Exchange of Experiences in Strategic Planning” to be organized. Institutions sponsoring the meeting, held in Barcelona in 1993, included the Inter-American Development Bank, the European Community Commission and the Iberoamerican Cooperation Institute. The cities of Amsterdam, Lisbon, Lille, Barcelona, Toronto and Santiago de Chile participated, among others.
At that meeting it was demonstrated, along with other relevant aspects, that if cooperative processes are used in large cities in order to carry out strategic planning processes, and if a reasonable degree of comprehension is reached between the administration, businesses and an ample representation of social agents, organizational synergies will develop that will eventually improve resource management and citizens’ quality of life.

History
Strategic Urban Planning processes (SUP), also known as Urban Renewal Projects, began to appear at the end of the 20th century. The city of San Francisco (U.S.A.) carried out its process between 1982 and 1984. The main motivation behind starting strategic urban planning processes was the attempt to adequately react to problematic situations (mainly economic crisis or standstill). At the beginning of the 21st century, this kind of organization is not reactive but proactive. In the case of Spain, crisis situations are not the main causes of these processes, rather they are motivated by the search for an improved level of public-private cooperation, the wish to coordinate activity, continued improvements, the wish to launch revitalization processes and even to follow others . The initial determination needed to launch this type of processes varies by region; in Spain, most processes are fronted by public entities, approximately 50%, while a significant percentage has mixed public-private leadership.

Description of SUP processes
An SUP process, according to Borja and Castells is:
The definition of a city project that unifies diagnoses, specifies public and private actions and establishes a coherent mobilization framework for the cooperation of urban social actors. A participative process is a priority when defining contents, as this process will be the basis for the viability of the objectives and actions proposed. The result of the Strategic plan should not necessarily be the creation of regulations or a government program (although its adoption by the State",science
Criminal investigation,"Criminal investigation is an applied science that involves the study of facts that are then used to inform criminal trials. A complete criminal investigation can include searching, interviews, interrogations, evidence collection and preservation, and various methods of investigation. Modern-day criminal investigations commonly employ many modern scientific techniques known collectively as forensic science.
Criminal investigation is an ancient science that may have roots as far back as c. 1700 BCE in the writings of the Code of Hammurabi. In the code, it is suggested that both the accuser and the accused had the right to present evidence they collected. In the modern era, criminals investigations are most often done by government police forces. Private investigators are also commonly hired to complete or assist in criminal investigations.
An early recorded professional criminal investigator was the English constable. Around 1250 CE, it was recorded that the constable was to ""... record...matters of fact, not matters of judgment and law.""

Investigative techniques
In determining the course of investigation, many law enforcement organizations use three ""indicators of suspicion"" describing potential suspects, jointly known as MMO:

means to commit the crime (including tools and physical capabilities)
motive to commit the crime (for example, financial gain or to seek revenge)
opportunity to commit the crime (including being at the crime scene at the time of the offence); persons presenting an alibi can be eliminated from suspicion
They will also establish the relationships between the victim and any potential offenders.

Investigation priority bias problems and proposed solutions
After observing recent changes in the demographic composition of particular crimes during higher priority of their investigation, such as the increase of the percentage of women convicted for joining and fighting for terrorist organizations from a very low percentage (similar to those of murder and rape) to almost as many women as men (women in the 40–50 percent range in some jurisdictions) as the priority of investigating terror crimes increased, certain criminologists are expressing the notion that there may be more crimes that would change their demographics if they got higher priority. These criminologists theorize that in the case of limited budgets, criminal investigators rely on profiled and statistical likelihood of particular groups of people being convicted for the type of crimes that are being investigated, and ignore complaints that are filed about people who they consider less likely to commit the crimes or give the tracking or individual matching to the evidence lower priority. According to the hypotheses, even a minimal or nonexistent difference in the likelihood of committing crimes can be hidden behind a difference of a factor by many multiples in the likelihood of being convicted due to self-fulfilling prophecies in the statistics. These criminologists feel ",science
American Islam (term),"American Islam is a pejorative political term used by advocates of political Islam to describe an allegedly inauthentic form of Islam advocating separation of religion and state and lacking in anti-Americanism. The term was reportedly first used by Sayyid Qutb in 1952, an Islamist and prominent member of the Muslim Brotherhood. It is widely used in the Islamic Republic of Iran where its critics describe it as a type of Islam that is, among other things, indifferent to oppression, extravagance, encroachment on the rights of the oppressed, that helps the oppressors and the powerful, and emphasizes ceremonial Islam.
Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader and founder of the Islamic Republic, used the term describing it as ""fake Islam"",  intended to deceive Muslims, preaching a separation of state and religion, that stands in opposition to ""pure Mohammedan Islam"".  According to the current Supreme Leader of Iran, Seyyed Ali Khamenei, (speaking in 2010), ""American Islam means ceremonial Islam, an Islam that is indifferent in the face of oppression.""

Background
At least according to the Iranian Fars News Agency, Sayyid Qutb, (Egyptian author, Islamist theorist), was the first one to use the phrase American Islam. ""Americans need Islam. They want an Islam that fights the communists in the Middle East, not an Islam that fights colonialism and autocracy. They don't want Islam to rule, because when the religion of Islam is ruled: it trains a nation for which it is obligatory to become strong and reject colonialism; Whether it is communist colonialism or American colonialism.""

American-religion (idiom)
In addition to this idiom (""American Islam""), Iran's first Supreme Leader, Ruhollah Khomeini used a similar idiom called ""American-religion""; at 1989, he wrote a letter to Mikhail Gorbachev (known as Khomeini's letter to Mikhail Gorbachev). There, Khomeini mentions the expression of ""American religion"", and called it an ""unreal religion"".
On the other hand, Khomeini mostly referred to ""pure and authentic Muhammadan Islam"" which stood in sharp contradiction to ""American Islam""; In his perception, called ""American-Islam"" for the separation of ""religion and politics"".

Point of view
Khomeini
Seyed Ruhollah Khomeini called American Islam:

the Islam of capitalism, the Islam of the arrogant, the Islam of the wealthy without pain, the Islam of hypocrisy, the Islam of money and force, the Islam of the comfortable, the Islam of the opportunists, the Islam of the aristocracy, the Islam of Abu Sufyan, Islam of humiliation and misery, Islam of deception and compromise and captivity, Islam of capital and capitalists rule over the oppressed and barefoot, Islam of modern capitalism and vampire communism, Islam of prosperity and luxury, Islam of eclecticism, etc.

RNU4-2 syndrome,"RNU4-2 Syndrome or ReNU syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by de novo variants in the human gene RNU4-2, which encodes an RNA component of the major spliceosome. It is characterized by hypotonia, global developmental delay, severely impaired intellectual development with poor or absent speech, delayed walking or inability to walk, feeding difficulties with poor overall growth, dysmorphic facial features, and brain anomalies, including ventriculomegaly.
The syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by de novo variants in RNU4-2, a gene on chromosome 12, which encodes the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) U4. U4 is a component of the major spliceosome, a complex of proteins and non-coding RNAs that is necessary for RNA splicing. Most cases of RNU4-2 / ReNU syndrome are explained by a 1-bp insertion (n.64_65insT, NR_003137.2), which is thought to disrupt the interactions of snRNA U4 with the snRNA U6, affecting the stability of the ACAGAGA loop of U6 sRNA which binds 5' splice sites and induces splicing after U4-U6 unwinding. Disrupted splicing, in particular a change in 5' splice site usage, has been reported in individuals with variants in RNU4-2.
The genetic etiology of RNU4-2 / ReNU syndrome was first described in a preprint in April 2024. It was subsequently published by two research teams independently, both who used data collected by Genomics England. One team, led by the English statistician Daniel Greene working at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, used a Bayesian analysis. The other team involved a global collaboration led by Yuyang Chen and Nicola Whiffin of the University of Oxford.
Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, brain anomalies, distinctive facies, and absent language (NEDHAFA) was a suggested name for this syndrome, however, ReNU syndrome (pronounced 'renew') was chosen through a collaboration between researchers and the families of those impacted by variants in RNU4-2. The name symbolises that this diagnosis “renews” hope for a brighter future for all those affected.

Avestan period,"The Avestan period (c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE) is the period in the history of the Iranians when the Avesta was produced. It saw important contributions to both the religious sphere, as well as to Iranian mythology and its epic tradition.
Scholars can reliably distinguish between two different linguistic strata in the Avesta; Old Avestan and Young Avestan, which are interpreted as belonging to two different stages in the development of the Avestan language and society. The Old Avestan society is the one to which Zarathustra himself and his immediate followers belonged. The Young Avestan society is less clearly delineated and reflects a larger time span.
There is a varying level of agreement on the chronological and geographical boundaries of the Avestan period. Regarding the geographical extent of the Avesta, modern scholarship agrees that it reflects the eastern portion of Greater Iran. Regarding the chronological extent, scholarship initially focused on a late chronology, that places Zarathustra in the 6th century BCE. More recently an early  chronology, that places him several centuries earlier, has become widely accepted. This early chronology would largely place the Avestan period before the Achaemenid period, making it the earliest period of Iranian history for which literary sources are available.

Sources
The primary source for the Avestan period are the texts of the Avesta, i.e., the collection of canonical texts of Zoroastrianism. All material in the Avesta is composed in Avestan, an otherwise unattested Old Iranian language. The Avesta itself was compiled and put into writing much later during the Middle Iranian Sassanian period. At this time, Avestan had long ceased to be a spoken language and it is generally agreed that these texts had been passed down orally for some time. The exact age and provenance of different Avestan texts are still debated, but scholars can reliably distinguish two linguistic layers, Old Avestan and Young Avestan.

Old Avestan
The Old Avestan material is found in the Staota Yesnya, the central part of Zoroastrinian High Liturgies like the Yasna and the Visperad. The Staota Yesnya consists of the Gathas, the Yasna Haptanghaiti, and a number of manthras, namely the Ashem Vohu, the Ahuna Vairya and the Airyaman ishya. These Old Avestan texts are assumed to have been composed close together and must have crystallized early on, possibly due to the associating with Zarathustra himself. A few texts are sometimes considered to be in pseudo Old Avestan, namely the Yenghe hatam manthra and some parts of the Yasna Haptanghaiti. This could mean they originated during the Young Avestan period but were composed in such a way to make them appear more ancient.

Young Avestan
The Young Avestan material is much larger, but also more varied and may reflect a longer time of composition and transmission, during which the different texts may have been constantly updated and revised. At some time, however, this process stopped, i.e., the",history
Aestheticization of politics,"The aestheticization of politics was an idea first coined in ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"" by critical theorist Walter Benjamin as being a key ingredient to fascist regimes. Benjamin said that fascism tends towards an aestheticization of politics, in the sense of a spectacle in which it allows the masses to express themselves without seeing their rights recognized, and without affecting the relations of ownership which the proletarian masses aim to eliminate. Benjamin said:

Fascism attempts to organize the newly proletarianized masses without affecting the property structure which the masses strive to eliminate. Fascism sees its salvation in giving these masses not their right, but instead a chance to express themselves. The masses have a right to change property relations; Fascism seeks to give them an expression while preserving property. The logical result of Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life. [...] Mankind, which in Homer’s time was a spectacle for the Olympian gods, has become one for itself. [...] Communism responds by politicizing art.
In the essay, Benjamin connected the concept to the Italian Futurist movement and its involvement in the fascist regime of Italy.
Alternately, ""politicization of aesthetics"" (or ""politicization of art"") has been used as a term for an ideologically opposing synthesis, wherein art is ultimately subordinate to political life and thus a result of it, separate from it, but which is attempted to be incorporated for political use as theory relating to the consequential political nature of art. The historian Emilio Gentile has stressed that these two ideas are not mutually exclusive, and have a large degree of the other.
In Benjamin's original formulation, the politicization of aesthetics was considered the opposite of the aestheticization of politics, the latter possibly being indicated as an instrument of ""mythologizing"" totalitarian Fascist regimes. The ""politicizing of art"", in contrast, requires one to ""[affirm] the political value and force of art [by] demystifying concepts like genius and eternal value [and by] demystifying the idea [...] that art expresses the essential nature of some nation or race"". In other words, to politicize art is to recognize that it is fundamentally a product that exists within a specific socio-cultural context; communism thus ""takes art seriously not just as a cultural product but as a cultural force"".
Benjamin's concept has been linked to Guy Debord's 1967 book, The Society of the Spectacle.

Social services,"Social services are a range of public services intended to provide support and assistance towards particular groups, which commonly include the disadvantaged. They may be provided by individuals, private and independent organizations, or administered by a government agency. Social services are connected with the concept of welfare and the welfare state, as countries with large welfare programs often provide a wide range of social services. Social services are employed to address the wide range of needs of a society. Prior to industrialisation, the provision of social services was largely confined to private organisations and charities, with the extent of its coverage also limited. Social services are now generally regarded globally as a 'necessary function' of society and a mechanism through which governments may address societal issues.
The provision of social services by governments is linked to the belief of universal human rights, democratic principles, as well as religious and cultural values. The availability and coverage of social services varies significantly within societies. The main groups which social services is catered toward are: families, children, youths, elders, women, the sick, and the disabled. Social services consists of facilities and services such as: public education, welfare, infrastructure, mail, libraries, social work, food banks, universal health care, police, fire services, public transport and public housing.

Characteristics
The term ‘social services’ is often substituted with other terms such as social welfare, social protection, social assistance, social care and social work, with many of the terms overlapping in characteristics and features. What is considered a ‘social service’ in a specific country is determined by its history, cultural norms, political system and economic status. The most central aspects of social services include education, health services, housing programs, and transport services. Social services can be both communal and individually based. This means that they may be implemented to provide assistance to the community broadly, such as economic support for unemployed citizens, or they may be administered specifically considering the need of an individual – such as foster homes. Social services are provided through a variety of models. Some of these models include:

The Scandinavian model: based on the principles within 'universalism'. This model provides significant aid to disadvantaged groups such as people with disabilities and is administered through the local government with limited contributions from non-governmental organisations.
The family care model: employed throughout the Mediterranean, this model relies on the aid of individuals and families which usually work with clergy, as well as that of NGOs such as the Red Cross.
The means-tested model: employed in the UK and Australia, the government provides support but has stringent regulations and checks which it employs to determine who",science
Grassroots lobbying,"Grassroots lobbying (also indirect lobbying) is lobbying  with the intention of reaching the legislature and making a difference in the decision-making process. Grassroots lobbying is an approach that separates itself from direct lobbying through the act of asking the general public to contact legislators and government officials concerning the issue at hand, as opposed to conveying the message to the legislators directly.  Companies, associations and citizens are increasingly partaking in grassroots lobbying as an attempt to influence a change in legislation.
The unique characteristic of grassroots lobbying, in contrast to other forms of lobbying, is that it involves stimulating the politics of specific communities. This type of lobbying is different from the more commonly known direct lobbying, as it is naturally brought upon by the organization.

Tactics
There are several tactics used by groups in order to promote or advocate different issues politically, but the main two tactics used in grassroots or ""outside"" advocacy are education of constituents through holding press conferences or organizing press releases, and mobilizing targeted people who will be impacted negatively or positively   to create a movement.

Media Lobbying
Grassroots lobbying often implement the use of media to expand their outreach. Campaigns are developed and are published in all forms of media ranging from television to magazines and internet. Because grassroots lobbying is geared toward local organizations and communities, these types of media outlets are used mainly by large associations that can afford them. Smaller organizations tend to use free media on public television, radio and other smaller outlets. Other forms of free media that make a large impact are things like boycotting, protesting and demonstrations.

Social media
The trend of the past decade has been the use of social media outlets to reach people across the globe. Social media are by nature grassroots organizers. They provide a way for communities, not only to interact, but to form around topics. Implementing social media tactics in grassroots lobbying would provide a much broader outreach and would allow activists to not only inform but interact with various people about their cause.
Some advocates are now using social media to reduce the cost of traditional campaigns, and to more precisely target public officials with political messages.
An example of the use of social media as a tool of grassroots lobbying is in the Black Lives Matter movement. Social media created platforms for broad discourse that allowed for the information sharing of both policy issues and solutions as well as mobilization. In interviews conducted by Mundt and Ross, social media administrators for BLM groups emphasized the importance of promoting action plans for members on social media to achieve concrete results. These action plans include grassroots lobbying in the form of directly contacting legislators about policy reform.",politics
Martha Wray,"Martha Wray (1739-1788), was an English businessperson.

Career
She was the niece of the weaver Robert Turlington (1697–1766), who invented and sold the then famous medicine Balsam of Life from 1744. Turlington was working with William Wray, Martha's husband, to export the medicine to the American colonies by 1750.
Both men died in 1766, and Turlington left the business to his niece, Martha Wray, and his niece-in-law, Mary Sopp. Martha Wray invited her brother-in-law, Hilton Wray, to join the business in 1773. In 1774, Mary Sopp left the business to marry. 
Martha Wray died in 1788, but Hilton Wray continued to run the business until 1804, when he filed for bankruptcy.

Personal Life
She was married to William Wray until his death in 1766.

Legacy
She was one of the successful 18th-century businesswomen portrayed in the exhibition ‘City Women in the 18th Century’ in London 21 September – 18 October 2019.

Ironman (surf lifesaving),"The sport of Ironman was developed in 1964 in Australia by Valentine Trainor to combine the four main disciplines of surf lifesaving into a single race; swimming, board paddling, ski paddling and running. The sport should not be confused with Ironman triathlon. It is typically run as a single event as a part of a surf life saving carnival, although it can be run as a sport in its own right. Internationally it is sometimes called Oceanman.

History
After the creation of the Surf Lifesaving movement in 1907, members needed a way to stay fit and hone their skills in between patrols. Thus, in 1915, the first NSW Titles were held. These early titles held traditional events such as the boat race, march past, R&R and surf races. On a 1964 Australian tour of California, the competitors came across an event known as the 'Taplin', which involved a swim, ski, board legs, with running transitions. This became the ironman race. In 1966, it was first held at the Australian Championships at Coolangatta beach, and was won by Hayden Kenny.
Perhaps the most famous ironman was Grant Kenny, who in 1980 at the age of 16 made the event famous by winning the Australian Junior and Australian Open Ironman championships within the space of half an hour. Grant became a national hero, appearing on cereal boxes and television advertisements, and was seen as the pinnacle of Aussie sportsmen. The short Ironman event became famous and the centre of attention at all surf carnivals.
In the early 1980s a movie was made called The Coolangatta Gold, about an ironman event that required competitors to complete a 42 kilometres (26 mi) course along Queensland's Gold Coast. A circuit was then developed that mixed 10-minute Ironman races with the 'Coolangatta Gold', and a range of other professional Ironman events around Australia.
In 1989 an elite group of Ironmen took the sport one step further and created an ironman event for TV. The event was named the Uncle Toby's Super Series and was initially very successful, but after 10 years of big television ratings, the retirement of a few of the sports biggest start lead to a decline in its popularity in the late 1990s. This led to the end of the Uncle Toby's Super Series in the 2000/2001 season. An attempt to revive the series was made in 2011 with the introduction of Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Ironman Series which was also televised on Network Ten however by 2011 the Australian sporting television landscape had changed, meaning live, free to air sport didn't command the same viewing numbers as the 1990s and therefore didn't support as high a level of commercial support and funding. Whilst those that watched the revived series found it highly entertaining, attracting the required large numbers proved to be an uphill battle.
In 2013, the Kellogg's Ironman series switched to the larger viewing base of Channel 9 and Wide World of Sports.  They also reverted to 5 pre-recorded rounds followed by a live final.  This was deemed to be a successful trans",sports
History of Poles in Königsberg,"The history of Poles in Königsberg (Polish: Królewiec) goes back to the 14th century. In the struggles between the Kingdom of Poland and the Teutonic Order, the city was briefly part of the Polish state, and after the Second Peace of Toruń, 1466, it was considered a part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Order and the secular Duchy of Prussia, as the capital of both entities. During the Protestant Reformation Königsberg became the center of Polish Lutheranism and partially for this reason, a birthplace of Polish printing and one of the epicenters of vernacular Polish literature. Polish intellectuals and scholars played a major role in the founding of the University of Königsberg (Albertina) and served as both faculty and administrators.
Over the course of the 19th century the Polish population in Königsberg declined, due to assimilation and Germanization, although the publication of Polish language works in the city continued until World War I.

Background
In 1255 the Teutonic Knights, during the Prussian Crusade, captured the Baltic Prussian fortress of Tuwangste  on the Pregel (Pregola) river. On its site they expanded the existing fortifications into what later became known as the Königsberg Castle. The new fort was named in honor of king Ottokar II of Bohemia (König is the German word for king). Subsequently, towards the end of the thirteenth century, the towns of Altstadt (Old Town, Stare Miasto), Kneiphof (Knipawa) and Löbenicht (Lipnik) arose around the castle and these would eventually together form the town of Konigsberg.  The initial settlements were populated mostly by immigrants from the Hanseatic city of Lübeck (Liubice) as well as local Sambian converts to Christianity. They were served by the newly built St. Michael's Church in what later would become known as the Steindamm (Polish: Kamienna Grobla, literally: ""stone dam"", ""stone levee"") neighborhood.  Although the church, along with a good portion of the town, was destroyed during the Great Prussian Uprising (1260-1274), it was rebuilt during the first half of the fourteenth century and eventually came to play an important role in the Polish cultural life of the city.

Polish name of the city
The first recorded name of the castle is castrum de Coningsberg in Zambia. The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz, writing in the 15th century referred to the city's battle standard captured by the Poles at the Battle of Grunwald (1410) by both the German name Kunigsperk and the Polish version Crolowgrod, which given the Polish orthography of the time, has been transliterated as Krolowgrod. Król is the Polish word for king and gród is similar to the German ending ""berg"". Krolowgrod by the 16th century became the standard Polish name Królewiec.

Polish settlement in the city up to the Protestant Reformation
Polish migrants from Masuria began moving to Königsberg during the fourteenth century, settling particularly in the Knipawa portion of the town, and, along with Lithuanians and Kurlandian",history
Confidence and supply,"In parliamentary democracies based on the Westminster system, confidence and supply is an arrangement under which a minority government (one which does not control a majority in the legislature) receives the support of one or more parties or independent MPs on confidence votes and the state budget (""supply""). On issues other than those outlined in the confidence and supply agreement, non-government partners to the agreement are not bound to support the government on any given piece of legislation.
A coalition government is a more formal arrangement than a confidence-and-supply agreement, in that members from junior parties (i.e., parties other than the largest) gain positions in the cabinet and ministerial roles, and are generally expected to hold the government whip on passing legislation.

Confidence
In most parliamentary democracies, members of a parliament can propose a motion of confidence or of no confidence in the government or executive. The results of such motions show how much support the government currently has in parliament. Should a motion of confidence fail, or a motion of no confidence pass, the government will usually either resign and allow other politicians to form a new government, or call an election.

Supply
Most parliamentary democracies require an annual state budget, an appropriation bill, also called supply bill, or occasional financial measures to be passed by parliament in order for a government to pay its way and enact its policies. The failure of a supply bill is in effect the same as the failure of a confidence motion. In early modern England, the withholding of funds was one of Parliament's few ways of controlling the monarch.

Absentee ballot,"An absentee ballot is a vote cast by someone who is unable or unwilling to attend the official polling station to which the voter is normally allocated. Methods include voting at a different location, postal voting, proxy voting and online voting. Increasing the ease of access to absentee ballots is seen by many as one way to improve voter turnout through convenience voting, though some countries require that a valid reason, such as infirmity or travel, be given before a voter can participate in an absentee ballot. Early voting overlaps with absentee voting. Early voting includes votes cast before the official election day(s), by mail, online or in-person at voting centers which are open for the purpose. Some places call early in-person voting a form of ""absentee"" voting, since voters are absent from the polling place on election day.
In the electoral terminology of some countries, such as Australia, ""absentee voting"" means specifically a vote cast at a different polling station to one to which the voter has been allocated. ""Early voting"", ""proxy voting"" or ""postal voting"" are separate concepts in these countries. The history of absentee voting dates back to the 19th century, and modern-day procedures and availability vary by jurisdiction. Absentee voting may be available on demand, or limited to individuals meeting certain criteria, such as a proven inability to travel to a designated polling place. Many electors are required to apply for absentee voting, although some may receive a postal ballot by default. In some elections postal voting is the only voting method allowed and is referred to as all-postal voting. Typically, postal votes must be mailed back on or before the scheduled election day. However, in some jurisdictions return methods may allow for dropping off the ballot in person via secure drop boxes or at voting centers.
Electoral laws typically allow for the integrity and secrecy of the submitted ballot to be maintained, and stipulate a series of checks to protect against voter fraud. Voting at a distant polling place is subject to the same controls as voting locally, though distant staff are less likely to recognize an impersonator than local staff. Voting by mail is sometimes controlled by using security printing, such as special paper, or by requiring signatures of voters and sometimes witnesses, though signature comparisons have 10-14% error rates. Thousands of ballots fail these checks and are rejected. Evidence of fraud is uncommon, but Russia has been reported to use absentee voting for vote monitoring enabling voter intimidation. While postal voting has a greater risk of fraud than in-person voting, on an absolute level cases of known fraud are extremely rare.

Peasant economics,"Peasant economics is an area of economics in which a wide variety of economic approaches ranging from the neoclassical to the marxist are used to examine the political economy of the peasantry.  The defining feature of the peasants are that they are typically seen to be only partly integrated into the market economy -— an economy which, in societies with a significant peasant population, is typically found to have many imperfect, incomplete or missing markets. Peasant economics treats peasants as something different from other farmers as they are not assumed to be simply  small profit maximizing farmers; by contrast, peasant economics covers a wide range of different theories  of peasant  household  behavior. These include various assumptions about the maximization of profits,  risk aversion,  drudgery aversion, and sharecropping. The assumptions,  logic,  and  predictions of these theories are examined and the impact of  subsistence is typically found to have important implications in terms of producers  decisions about supply, consumption and price. Chayanov was an early proponent of the importance of understanding peasant behaviour arguing that peasants would work as hard as they needed in order to meet their subsistence needs, but had no incentive beyond those needs and therefore would slow and stop working once they were met. This principle, the consumption-labour-balance principle, implies that the peasant household will increase its work until it meets (balances) the needs (consumption) of the household. A possible implication of this view of peasant societies is that they will not develop without some external, added factor. Peasant economics has been seen as being an important area of study by some development economists, agricultural sociologists, and anthropologists.

Peasant Society
The economist George Dalton, through surveying agrarian peasant economies in areas of West Africa, suggests that in societies where peasant economics is the predominant form of production, those societies generally consist of a community of family units. Dalton defines this community as ""a circle of people who live together… so that they share not this or that particular interest, but a whole set of interests wide enough and comprehensive enough to include their lives."" These communities largely produce for their own subsistence, as opposed to producing for markets. The production processes that occur in these societies center around this subsistence, and the organization of this society into a communal form of production. As Dalton writes of African peasant communities, unemployment and economic depression are not the main issues. Instead, these societies primarily have to contend with issues within the environment, like the weather and plant diseases. Peasants are also less likely to be specialists in a particular area of production and will spend time across the year doing a wide range of productive activities. Dalton also argued that peasant societies ",economics
Imperial College Faculty of Natural Sciences,"The Faculty of Natural Sciences is one of four faculties of Imperial College London in London, England. It was formed in 2001 from the former Royal College of Science, a constituent college of Imperial College which dated back to 1848, and the faculty largely consists of the original departments of the college. Undergraduate teaching occurs for all departments at the South Kensington campus, with research being split between South Kensington and the new innovation campus at White City.
Students who study at the departments of the Faculty are represented by the Royal College of Science Union, a constituent union of the college union which caters specifically to students on natural science courses. Graduates who obtain an undergraduate degree, either BSc or MSci, from the faculty are awarded the Associateship of the Royal College of Science (ARCS) as an additional degree.

History
The origins of the faculty lie in the Royal College of Chemistry, which, after being founded in 1845, moved to a new site in South Kensington in the early 1870s. Incorporated into the Normal School of Science, the college was later renamed the Royal College of Science in 1890, and in 1907 became a constituent college of the newly formed Imperial College of Science and Technology.
In 2001, Imperial was restructured to form four new faculties, including the faculties of Physical Sciences and Life Sciences, which took over the role of the Royal College of Science. These faculties were later re-merged over the course of 2005-2006 to form the Faculty of Natural Sciences, which comprises the same departments as the original Royal College of Science.

Departments
The faculty includes five academic departments:

Derrick Morris,"Derrick Morris (24 March 1930 – 30 July 2005) was, at the time of his death, Europe's longest-surviving heart transplant recipient, living 25 years after the transplant performed by Sir Magdi Yacoub in 1980. He died from an illness that was not heart or transplant related.
Morris had his first heart attack in 1975 and was told to expect to live only months. He became an active campaigner against heart disease, an advocate of organ donation as well as a symbol of the success of organ transplantation.

Early life and illness
Derrick Morris was born on 24 March 1930. He was from Swansea in Wales, and was working as a supervisor at Swansea Docks when he suffered his first heart attack in 1975. He was given only a 15% chance of survival, and was told to ""live six months at a time"".

Heart surgery
Morris was initially sceptical when a heart transplant was suggested but was persuaded by his doctor. He recalled, ""we were told of the dangers. Because transplant work was in its infancy, the chances of survival were slim. But I decided for the family's sake to go ahead."" His surgeon Magdi Yacoub later commented that Morris's transplant helped shape public opinion: ""Most importantly, Derrick went on to show that transplantation was a good thing.""
The operation took place on 23 February 1980 at Harefield Hospital and was Yacoub's third such procedure and one of 14 performed at Harefield that year, following an initial moratorium on heart transplant procedures and before the introduction of cyclosporin. The procedure had been discontinued in 1973 due to poor results. The donor was a 26-year-old woman who had been killed in a car crash. After the operation, Morris eventually returned to work at the docks. He was the eleventh person in the UK to receive a heart transplant.
It was argued that the cost of the operation was not money well spent because the National Health Service would have been better to spend it on preventing heart disease rather than doing transplants. Several people who had transplants at Harefield died while Morris was recovering.
Morris's fate became intertwined with the largely transformative transplant success of Yacoub.

Later life
By the 20th anniversary of his operation, Morris already held the European survival record. The longest heart transplant survivor in Britain before Morris's surgery was Keith Castle, who had surgery performed by Sir Terence English in August 1979 at Papworth Hospital.
In conjunction with celebrating his two decades of postoperative life, Morris said his heart disease was serious and debilitating, noting: ""Twenty years ago I was a complete invalid. I couldn't even walk. In February 1980 Yacoub gave me my new heart and since then I have come on in leaps and bounds.""  This enabled him to travel to a number of countries, including making five journeys to the United States, and see his grandchildren grow up.  These were all experiences that would not have been possible without the transplant.

Jurisprudence,"Jurisprudence, also known as theory of law or philosophy of law, is the examination in a general perspective of what law is and what it ought to be. It investigates issues such as the definition of law; legal validity; legal norms and values; and the relationship between law and other fields of study, including economics, ethics, history, sociology, and political philosophy.
Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was based on the first principles of natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems and problems of law as a social institution that relates to the larger political and social context in which it exists. Jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered:

Natural law holds that there are rational objective limits to the power of rulers, the foundations of law are accessible through reason, and it is from these laws of nature that human laws gain force.
Analytic jurisprudence rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be, espousing the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems. It encompasses theories such as legal positivism and legal realism.
Normative jurisprudence is concerned with evaluative theories of law, dealing with what the goal or purpose of law is and what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law. It attempts to determine what the proper function of law should be, what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted.
Sociological jurisprudence studies the nature and functions of law in the light of social scientific knowledge. It emphasises variation of legal phenomena between different cultures and societies. It relies especially on empirically-oriented social theory, but draws theoretical resources from diverse disciplines.
Experimental jurisprudence seeks to investigate the content of legal concepts using the methods of social science, unlike the philosophical methods of traditional jurisprudence.
The terms ""philosophy of law"" and ""jurisprudence"" are often used interchangeably, though jurisprudence sometimes encompasses forms of reasoning that fit into economics or sociology.

Overview
Whereas lawyers are interested in what the law is on a specific issue in a specific jurisdiction, analytical philosophers of law are interested in identifying the features of law shared across cultures, times, and places. Taken together, these foundational features of law offer the kind of universal definition philosophers are after. The general approach allows philosophers to ask questions about, for example, what separates law from morality, politics, or practical reason. While the field has traditionally focused on giving an account of law'",science

Kaylee Davidson-Olley,"Kaylee Davidson-Olley (born 1987) was the United Kingdom's first successful heart transplant baby when she received a replacement heart at less than one year of age. In 2017 she celebrated her 30th year after the transplant operation; it was her 30th year as the longest surviving heart transplant baby in Europe. The operation was performed by cardiothoracic surgeon, Christopher McGregor at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, which became one of only two UK centres performing transplants in children, and the main hospital in the UK carrying out transplants for adults born with congenital heart disease.
She went on to become an advocate of the organ donor register and in 2013 won the gold medal for the 4 × 100 metres relay race at the World Transplant Games.

Early life
Kaylee Davidson-Olley was born in 1987. She was raised in Houghton-le-Spring, County Durham. Her mother is Carol Olley.
As an infant, she was diagnosed with a cardiomyopathy and for six weeks prior to her heart transplant, was severely ill in the Freeman Hospital's intensive care unit.

Davidson-Olley's heart transplantation was performed on 14 October 1987 by surgeon Christopher McGregor at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, when Davidson-Olley was either four or five months old.  McGregor had previously transplanted a heart into an adult woman in May 1985, the recipient surviving for 25 years.
Ten days after the transplant operation, the media were allowed admission to the intensive care unit where Davidson-Olley was a patient. Subsequently, the Freeman Hospital became one of only two centres in Britain performing transplants on children, and the main hospital in Britain carrying out transplants for adults born with congenital heart disease.

Advocacy
Davidson-Olley has campaigned on behalf of the organ donor register, saying in her 25th year of survival that she was only alive ""because of the generosity of a family who made that important decision about organ donation, a decision that saved my life"".
In 2013, at the World Transplant Games in Durban, South Africa, Davidson-Olley ran the 4 × 100 metres relay and won the gold medal.
In 2017, Davidson-Olley observed the 30th anniversary of the heart transplant procedure and her 30th year as the longest surviving heart transplant baby in Europe. To celebrate, she and the staff from the Freeman Hospital, members of families of people who have had transplants, the president of the World Transplant Games Federation and her surgeon, took the ""Walk for Life"", starting at Baltic Square, stopping at the Copthorne Hotel and then making their way across Newcastle's Millennium Bridge. McGregor stated that he had ""followed Kaylee's progress and achievements over the last 30 years"" and was ""delighted to walk with Kaylee and share her special day and the success of the paediatric heart and lung transplant programme"".

National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine,"The National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine was established by the Decree of the President of Ukraine of February 24, 1993 No. 59 [59/93]. The academy is a state-owned research organization on medicine and health care, which operates in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine on a self-governing basis.
The status of the National Academy was granted by the Decree of the President of Ukraine of February 24, 2010 No. 255.

History of the academy
In 1991, the Department of Medical Problems was organized at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (then the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR). But leading medical scientists understood the need to establish an Academy of Medical Sciences in Ukraine. In November 1992, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law ""Fundamentals of the Legislation of Ukraine on Health Care"", the 20th article of which included the following: ""Higher scientific medical institution of Ukraine search is the Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine. In pursuance of this Law, the establishment of the academy was initiated. The principles of organization of the Academy of Medical Sciences were discussed at the meeting of the President of the National Academy of Sciences Academician Borys Paton and Academicians Mykola Amosov, Oleksandr Vozianov, Yuriy Kundiev, Olena Lukyanova, Volodymyr Frolkis, Oleksandr Shalimov with the President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. On February 24, 1993, the President of Ukraine signed a Decree establishing the Academy of Medical Sciences, defining its status, main tasks and establishing the number. The Presidential Decree was developed by the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, which appointed Academician Vozianov President-Organizer of the academy, appointed 25 founding academics, and determined the list of scientific institutions that were to be part of the academy.

Later, at the General Meeting of the Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Academician Vozianov was elected President of the academy, Academicians Zozulya and Frolkis were elected vice-presidents, and after the death of Frolkis, Academician Kundiev. Later, another position of vice president was taken by Academician Rosenfeld. Until 1997, the position of Chief Scientific Secretary of the Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine was held by the corresponding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine Gubsky, and since 1997 the corresponding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine was elected.
The Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine initially included 13 scientific institutions. In the past 15 years, six more scientific institutions have been established. In addition, in 2000, by a resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, 18 more research institutes were transferred to the academy. The Academy of Medical Sciences employs more than 20,000 people, including about 3,000 scientists, including nearly 2,500 doctors and candidates of science.

London medical students who assisted at Belsen,"In early April 1945, at the request of the British Army, the British Red Cross and the War Office called for 100 volunteer medical students from nine London teaching hospitals to assist in feeding starving Dutch children who had been liberated from German occupation by advancing Allied forces. However, in the meantime, British troops had liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and the students were diverted there on the day they were due to travel to the Netherlands. The students had previously spent most of the Second World War at school and in medical training.
The students were tasked with taking over one or two of the 200 camp huts each, with the responsibility of cleaning and feeding the survivors and supervising a fair distribution of food. Their work was instrumental in reducing the death rate from over 500 a day at liberation to less than 100 a day by mid-May 1945.
Sources show that twelve students came from each of Guy's Hospital, St Thomas', St Mary's, The London and University College, eleven from Westminster, nine from St Bartholomew's, eight from the Middlesex and the remainder from King's.
The Imperial War Museum holds a number of the students' letters and diaries which were a source for Ben Shephard's 2005 book After Daybreak: The Liberation of Belsen, 1945. Their story has also been portrayed in the 2007 feature-length drama, The Relief of Belsen. The diary of Westminster student Michael Hargrave was published in 2014.

Recruitment
In early April 1945, a call for 100 volunteer medical students in their final 18 months of medical school was made by the British Red Cross and the War Office at the request of the British Army, to assist in feeding starving Dutch children. However, in the interim, British troops had liberated Belsen and at the request of Brigadier Hugh Glyn-Hughes, the students were diverted to Belsen on the day of departure to Holland. The total number of students who volunteered was more than 100 and they were therefore shortlisted by ballot. Somewhere between 95 and 100 took part, with the exact number uncertain. Laurence Wand, a student from St Bartholomew's, later recounted the events of 1945 and gave with certainty the number as 96 as ""this number fitted neatly into six Dakota aircraft which were to be used for our transport to Germany"". Up until this time, these students had spent the larger part of the Second World War at school and in medical education. Several students had previously attended Epsom College.

Journey to Belsen
At the end of April 1945, the students were immunised against typhoid, typhus and diphtheria. Dressed in battledress, at 2pm on 28 April 1945, they met the British Red Cross at 5, Lowndes Street after having some official photographs taken. Student Michael Hargrave described in his diary that day that there were ""some very faked photographs of me shaking hands with the Dean - supposed to be saying goodbye"". Upon arrival at Lowndes Street, they were given their passports, ranking cards",medicine
History of cities,"Towns and cities have a long history, although opinions vary on which ancient settlements are truly cities. Historically, the benefits of dense, permanent settlement were numerous, but required prohibitive amounts of food and labor to maintain. Ancient cities allowed for the pooling of resources, exchange of ideas, large marketplaces, and even some shared amenities such as drinking water, sewerage, law enforcement, and roads. The first cities formed and grew once these benefits of proximity between people exceeded the cost of work required to maintain a settlement. Various technologies such as bricks, pottery, and animal taming played a large role in the costs and benefits of maintaining the earliest forms of cities. Cities were first made possible by advances in  technology.

Origins
There is not enough evidence to assert with certainty what conditions gave rise to the first cities. Smaller human settlements (such as villages) pre-date cities by many thousands of years. Before permanent settlement in cities, there were also large temporary settlements used for religious purposes or as a stopping place for nomadic people.  
Anthropologists speculate on what they consider suitable pre-conditions and basic mechanisms that might have been important driving forces in the shift to permanent settlement. The conventional view holds that cities first formed after the Neolithic Revolution, and the introduction of agriculture. The ability to produce food from a fixed location made permanent settlements much more attractive to ancient people. However, whether farming immigrants replaced foragers or foragers began farming is not clear. The increased food production per unit of land supported higher population density and more city-like activities in areas suitable for agriculture. In the book, Cities and Economic Development, Paul Bairoch takes up this position in his argument that agriculture and a surplus of food is necessary before cities can form. 

According to V. Gordon Childe, for a settlement to qualify as a city, it must have enough surplus of raw materials to support trade and a relatively large population. Bairoch points out that, due to sparse population densities that would have persisted in pre-Neolithic, hunter-gatherer societies, the amount of land that would be required to produce enough food for subsistence and trade for a large population would make it impossible to control the flow of trade. To illustrate this point, Bairoch offers an example: ""Western Europe during the pre-Neolithic, [where] the density must have been less than 0.1 person per square kilometre"". Using this population density as a base for calculation, and allotting 10% of food towards surplus for trade and assuming that city dwellers do no farming, he calculates that ""...to maintain a city with a population of 1,000, and without taking the cost of transport into account, an area of 100,000 square kilometres would have been required. When the cost of transport is taken int",history

Social work management,"Social work management is the management of organisations or enterprises in the social economy and non-profit sector, e.g., public service providers, charities, youth welfare offices, associations, etc. 
Social work management has been traditionally pursued by social workers, social pedagogues, pedagogues, psychologists without additional management skills and knowledge or legal practitioners and business economists – often without reference to the social economy. Furthermore, Social work management is a field of education & practice established since 1980s in Europe & North America that focuses on person-centred leadership, motivation & strategic issues. It manages organizations in social economy & non-profit sector.
Most scholars and practitioners agree that social work managers need to have a high degree of leadership skills to make considered managerial decisions, to empower social workers, to develop staff within and collaborate with partners outside the social and human service organisation. Social work management as a field of social work education and practice was established in many universities in Europe and North America  since the 1980s. Established qualifications in higher education first included diplomas in social economy. It originally focused on person-centred leadership, motivation and strategic issues. It combines management with social pedagogical, psychological, and sociological knowledge and skills.

Definition
In today's understanding, social management includes all management functions that are necessary for the management of social and/or non-profit organizations. This includes finance and accounting of social organizations, development of mission statements and concepts, city and social marketing, public relations, organizational development, human resource management, project management, quality management and other sub-disciplines of management and business administration.
In contrast to management in other industries, branches and areas of the economy (e.g. sports management or media and education management), social work management takes into account characteristics especially of organizations in the social sector: the provision of person-centered social services, the peculiarities of non-profit organizations and, in particular, labour and welfare services, the close integration into the social law as well as the character of the services as merit goods. With the increasing spread of private providers, social work management is also referred to as the management of enterprises in the social economy. Against this background, social work management can also be understood as a so-called specialised form of business administration for social enterprises or companies.
Some authors also understand social work management as the management of people with special consideration of human relationships in the sense of human resources management. However, this understanding does not apply to all social services organizations. A s",science
Elizate,"An elizate (Basque pronunciation: [elis̻ate]), (Spanish: anteiglesia) is an early form of local government in the Basque Country which was particularly common in Biscay but also existed in the other provinces. The terms elizate (in Standard Basque) and elexate (in Biscayan) literally translate as ""church door"" (eliza ""church"" + ate ""door""). The Spanish term anteiglesia translates as ""before [the] church"" or ""parvise"".
The peculiar name derives from the Basque custom where the family heads of a settlement connected to a particular parish would gather after mass at the entrance or portico of the church to make decisions regarding issues affecting their community. Their medieval history is closely linked to the emergence of the Batzar Nagusiak or ""Grand Meetings"", especially those of Biscay and Gipuzkoa (Juntas Generales de Vizcaya/Guipúzcoa in Spanish) and the establishment of parochial churches. Each elizate would elect a representative who would represent the elizate at a Batzar Nagusia, so the elizate represents an early form of local democracy. These enjoyed considerable autonomy in decision-making from the higher administrative authorities.

An elizate was steered by a fiel sindiko (fiel síndico in Spanish), who would organise meetings and bear a makila as a sign of authority. A fiel was normally chosen for one year through a number of methods. Some were nominated by the outgoing fiel, in some places the position of fiel would rotate through all farmholders of the elizate and in others the most recently married farmholder would be named fiel. Each elizate was subdivided into smaller units called kofradiak (cofradías in Spanish, ""brotherhoods"") which corresponded to the individual boroughs of an elizate.
A group of elizates was a merindad.
Through time elizates often became municipalities. In Biscay, during the time of the Lordship of Biscay (Bizkaiko Jaurerria in Basque, Señorío de Vizcaya in Spanish), the territory of all anteiglesias were referred to as Flat Land (Lur Laua in Basque, Tierra Llana in Spanish), as opposed to the more stratified cities. It was further incorporated into the administration. They became subject to the fueros which at the same time re-affirmed the status of nobility to all farmholders. This meant that unlike in most of feudal Europe, the farmers legally owned their land.
After centuries of political change, very few elizate remain today, two of the most notable in Iurreta and Derio. In 1962, in Francoist Spain, the name of the elizates was changed to auzo (neighbourhood, district) and they were merged into municipalities. The current term, auzo, is undistinguishable from the subdivisions of a city, which are called by the same term.

History of Matanzas,"Matanzas (Cuban Spanish pronunciation: [maˈtansas]; Lucumi: Ayá Áta) is the capital of the Cuban province of Matanzas. Known for its poets, culture, and Afro-Cuban folklore, it is located on the northern shore of the island of Cuba, on the Bay of Matanzas (Spanish Bahia de Matanzas), 90 kilometres (56 mi) east of the capital Havana and 32 kilometres (20 mi) west of the resort town of Varadero.
Matanzas is called the City of Bridges, for the seventeen bridges that cross the three rivers that traverse the city (Rio Yumuri, San Juan, and Canimar). For this reason it was referred to as the ""Venice of Cuba."" It was also called ""La Atenas de Cuba"" (""The Athens of Cuba"") for its poets.
Matanzas is known as the birthplace of the music and dance traditions danzón and rumba.

History
Matanzas was founded in 1693  as San Carlos y San Severino de Matanzas.  This followed a royal decree (""real cédula"") issued on September 25, 1690, which decreed that the bay and port of Matanzas be settled by 30 families from the Canary Islands.
Matanzas was one of the regions that saw intensive development of sugar plantations during the colonial era. Consequently, many African slaves were imported to support the sugar industry, particularly during the first half of the nineteenth century. For example, in 1792 there were 1900 slaves in Matanzas, roughly 30% of its population. In 1817, the slave population of Matanzas had grown to 10,773, comprising nearly 50% of the overall population. By 1841, 53,331 slaves made up 62.7% of the population of Matanzas. Census figures for 1859 put the Matanzas slave population at 104,519. Matanzas was the site of several slave insurrections and plots, including the infamous Escalera conspiracy(es) (discovered in late 1843, see also Year of the Lash). Due to the high number of both slaves and, importantly, free Afro-Cubans in Matanzas, the retention of African traditions is especially strong there. In 1898, Matanzas became the location of the first action in the Spanish–American War. The city was bombarded by American Navy vessels on 25 April 1898, just after the beginning of the war.

Name origin
The name Matanzas means ""massacre"" and refers to a putative slaughter in 1510 at the port of the same name, in which 30 Spanish soldiers tried to cross one of the rivers to attack an aboriginal camp on the far shore. The Spanish soldiers had no boats, so they enlisted the help of native fishermen. However, once they reached the middle of the river, the fishermen flipped the boats, and due to the Spanish soldiers' heavy metal armor, most of them drowned. Only two women—one said to be the beautiful María de Estrada—survived, the result of being taken by a Cacique. De Estrada is said to have later escaped the ""power of the Cacique"" and married Pedro Sánchez Farfán in the city of Trinidad.  According to municipal historian Arnaldo Jimenez de la Cal, ""[i]t was the first act of rebellion of natives in Cuba.""

Statistical physics,"In physics and chemistry, statistical mechanics is a mathematical framework that applies statistical methods and probability theory to large assemblies of microscopic entities. Sometimes called statistical physics or statistical thermodynamics, its applications include many problems in a wide variety of fields such as biology, neuroscience, computer science, information theory and sociology. Its main purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate, in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion.
Statistical mechanics arose out of the development of classical thermodynamics, a field for which it was successful in explaining macroscopic physical properties—such as temperature, pressure, and heat capacity—in terms of microscopic parameters that fluctuate about average values and are characterized by probability distributions.: 1–4 
While classical thermodynamics is primarily concerned with thermodynamic equilibrium, statistical mechanics has been applied in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to the issues of microscopically modeling the speed of irreversible processes that are driven by imbalances.: 3  Examples of such processes include chemical reactions and flows of particles and heat. The fluctuation–dissipation theorem is the basic knowledge obtained from applying non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to study the simplest non-equilibrium situation of a steady state current flow in a system of many particles.: 572–573

History
In 1738, Swiss physicist and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion.
The founding of the field of statistical mechanics is generally credited to three physicists:

Ludwig Boltzmann, who developed the fundamental interpretation of entropy in terms of a collection of microstates
James Clerk Maxwell, who developed models of probability distribution of such states
Josiah Willard Gibbs, who coined the name of the field in 1884
In 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by Rudolf Clausius, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell formulated the Maxwell distribution of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range. This was the first-ever statistical law in physics. Maxwell also gave the first mechanical argument that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards equilibrium. Five years later, in 1864, Ludwig Boltzmann, a young student in Vienna, came across Maxwell's paper and spent much of his life developing the subject further.
Statistical mechanics was initiated in the 1870s with the work of Boltzmann, much of which was collectivel",science
Cyclo-cross,"Cyclo-cross (cyclocross, CX,  cyclo-X or 'cross) is a form of bicycle racing. Races typically take place in the autumn and winter (the international or ""World Cup"" season is October–February), and consist of many laps of a short (2.5–3.5 km or 1.5–2 mile) course featuring pavement, wooded trails, grass, steep hills and obstacles requiring the rider to quickly dismount, carry the bike while navigating the obstruction and remount. Races for senior categories are generally between 40 minutes and an hour long, with the distance varying depending on the ground conditions.  The sport is strongest in the traditional road cycling countries such as Belgium (Flanders in particular), France and the Netherlands.
Cyclo-cross has parallels with mountain bike racing, cross-country cycling and criterium racing.  Many of the best cyclo-cross riders cross train in other cycling disciplines; however, cyclo-cross has reached such size and popularity that some racers are specialists, and many prioritize cyclo-cross races over other disciplines. Cyclo-cross bicycles are similar to road racing bicycles: lightweight, with somewhat narrow tires and drop handlebars. They are typically differentiated by their greater tire clearances, lower gearing, stronger frames, cantilever brakes or disc brakes and more upright riding position. They also share characteristics with mountain bikes in that they use knobby tread tires for traction and disc brakes. They have to be lightweight because competitors need to carry their bicycle to overcome barriers or slopes too steep to climb in the saddle. The sight of competitors struggling up a muddy slope with bicycles on their shoulders is the classic image of the sport, although unridable sections are generally a very small fraction of the race distance.
Compared with many disciplines of road and track cycle racing, tactics are fairly straightforward, and the emphasis is on the rider's aerobic endurance and bike-handling skills. Drafting, where cyclists form a line with the lead cyclist pedaling harder while reducing the wind resistance for other riders, is of much less importance than in road racing where average speeds are much higher than in cyclo-cross.
A cyclo-cross rider is allowed to change bicycles and receive mechanical assistance during a race. While the rider is on the course on one bike, their pit crew can clean, repair and oil a spare.

Origins and history
There are many stories about the origins of cyclo-cross. One is that European road racers in the early 1900s would race each other to the next town over from them and that they were allowed to cut through farmers' fields or over fences, or take any other shortcuts, in order to make it to the next town first. This was sometimes called steeple chase as the only visible landmark in the next town was often the steeple. This was a way for them to stay in shape during the winter months and put a twist on road racing.  In addition, riding off-road in more difficult conditions than ",sports
Corn exchange,"A corn exchange is a building where merchants trade grains. The word ""corn"" in British English denotes all cereal grains, such as wheat and barley; in the United States these buildings were called grain exchanges. Such trade was common in towns and cities across the British Isles until the 19th century, but as the trade became centralised in the 20th century many such buildings were used for other purposes. Several have since become historical landmarks.
In the United States, the Minneapolis Grain Exchange is still used to manage the commodities and futures exchange of grain products.

History in England
Corn exchanges were initially held as open markets normally controlled by the town or city authorities. Dedicated corn exchanges start appearing in the earlier part of the 18th century, increasing greatly following the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. They declined after the Great Depression of British Agriculture in the late 19th century.

Foreign Agricultural Service,"The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is the foreign affairs agency with primary responsibility for the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) overseas programs – market development, international trade agreements and negotiations, and the collection of statistics and market information. It also administers the USDA's export credit guarantee and food aid programs and helps increase income and food availability in developing nations by mobilizing expertise for agriculturally led economic growth. The FAS mission statement reads, ""Linking U.S. agriculture to the world to enhance export opportunities and global food security,"" and its motto is ""Linking U.S. Agriculture to the World.""

Early history
USDA posted its first employee abroad in 1882, with assignment of Edmund Moffat to London. In 1894, USDA created a Section of Foreign Markets in its Division of Statistics, which by 1901 numbered seven employees.  It was succeeded over the next few decades by increasingly larger units. Creation of this series of units in Washington to analyze foreign competition and demand for agricultural commodities was paralleled by assignment abroad of agricultural statistical agents, commodity specialists, and ""agricultural commissioners"".
Moffat went out as a ""statistical agent"" of USDA's Division of Statistics but with the status of Deputy Consul General on the roster of the Department of State at London. Subsequent USDA officials assigned overseas, however, did not enjoy diplomatic or consular status. This impeded their work, which at that point consisted mainly of collecting, analyzing, and transmitting to Washington time-sensitive market information on agricultural commodities.

 The analytical unit in Washington, by the early 1920s supervised by Leon Estabrook, deputy chief of USDA's Bureau of Agricultural Economics, compiled publications based on reports from the USDA's overseas staff, U.S. consuls abroad, and data collected by the Rome-based International Institute of Agriculture.
In 1924, USDA officials Nils Olsen and Louis Guy Michael and Congressman John Ketcham began drafting legislation to create an agricultural attaché service with diplomatic status. The legislation passed the House multiple times, but it did not pass the Senate until 1930, in part due to opposition from then-Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover. Hoover, however, eventually supported the legislation to garner support of the farm bloc during his presidential campaign. Accordingly, the Foreign Agricultural Service was created by the Foreign Agricultural Service Act of 1930 (46 Stat. 497), which President Herbert Hoover signed into law on June 5, 1930.
The law stipulated that the FAS consist of overseas USDA officials. The USDA also created a Foreign Agricultural Service Division within the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to serve as the FAS's headquarters staff in Washington, D.C., naming Asher Hobson, a noted economist and political scientist, as its first head.

Crony capitalism,"Crony capitalism, sometimes also called simply cronyism, is a pejorative term used in political discourse to describe a situation in which businesses profit from a close relationship with state power, either through an anti-competitive regulatory environment, direct government largesse, or corruption. Examples given for crony capitalism include obtainment of permits, government grants, tax breaks, or other undue influence from businesses over the state's deployment of public goods, for example, mining concessions for primary commodities or contracts for public works. In other words, it is used to describe a situation where businesses thrive not as a result of free enterprise, but rather collusion between a business class and the political class.
Wealth is then accumulated not merely by making a profit in the market, but through profiteering by rent seeking using this monopoly or oligopoly. Entrepreneurship and innovative practices that seek to reward risk are stifled since the value-added is little by crony businesses, as hardly anything of significant value is created by them, with transactions taking the form of trading. Crony capitalism spills over into the government, the politics, and the media, when this nexus distorts the economy and affects society to an extent it corrupts public-serving economic, political, and social ideals.

Historical usage
The first extensive use of the term ""crony capitalism"" came about in the 1980s, to characterize the Philippine economy under the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Early uses of this term to describe the economic practices of the Marcos regime included that of Ricardo Manapat, who introduced it in his 1979 pamphlet ""Some are Smarter than Others"", which was later published in 1991; former Time magazine business editor George M. Taber, who used the term in a Time magazine article in 1980, and activist (and later Finance Minister) Jaime Ongpin, who used the term extensively in his writing and is sometimes credited for having coined it.
The term crony capitalism made a significant impact in the public as an explanation of the Asian financial crisis.
It is also used to describe governmental decisions favoring cronies of governmental officials.
The term is used largely interchangeably with the related term corporate welfare, although the latter is by definition specific to corporations.

In practice
Crony capitalism exists along a continuum. In its lightest form, crony capitalism consists of collusion among market players which is officially tolerated or encouraged by the government. While perhaps lightly competing against each other, they will present a unified front (sometimes called a trade association or industry trade group) to the government in requesting subsidies aid or regulation. For instance, newcomers to a market then need to surmount significant barriers to entry in seeking loans, acquiring shelf space, or receiving official sanction.

List of nuclear weapons,"This is a list of nuclear weapons listed according to country of origin, and then by type within the states. The United States, Russia, China and India are known to possess a nuclear triad, being capable to deliver nuclear weapons by land, sea and air.

United States
American nuclear weapons of all types – bombs, warheads, shells, and others – are numbered in the same sequence starting with the Mark 1 and (as of March 2006) ending with the W91 (which was cancelled prior to introduction into service). All designs which were formally intended to be weapons at some point received a number designation. Pure test units which were experiments (and not intended to be weapons) are not numbered in this sequence.
Early weapons were very large and could only be used as free fall bombs. These were known by ""Mark"" designators, like the Mark 4 which was a development of the Fat Man weapon. As weapons became more sophisticated they also became much smaller and lighter, allowing them to be used in many roles. At this time the weapons began to receive designations based on their role; bombs were given the prefix ""B"", while the same warhead used in other roles, like missiles, would normally be prefixed ""W"". For instance, the W-53 warhead was also used as the basis for the B53 nuclear bomb. Such examples share the same sequence number.
In other cases, when the modifications are more significant, variants are assigned their own number. An example is the B61 nuclear bomb, which was the parent design for the W80, W81, and W84. There are also examples of out-of-sequence numbering and other prefixes used in special occasions.
This list includes weapons which were developed to the point of being assigned a model number (and in many cases, prototypes were test fired), but which were then cancelled prior to introduction into military service. Those models are listed as cancelled, along with the year or date of cancellation of their program.

Bombs – designated with Mark (""Mk"") numbers until 1968, and with ""B"" numbers after that. ""Test Experimental"" bombs designated with ""TX"".
Mark 1 – ""Little Boy"" gun-type uranium weapon (used against Hiroshima). (13–18 kilotons, 1945–1950)
Mark 2 – ""Thin Man"" plutonium gun design—cancelled in 1944 as not suitable for the plutonium produced i.e. plutonium-239 but with plutonium-240 isotope impurities.
Implosion Mark 2 – Another Manhattan Project plutonium implosion weapon, a hollow pit implosion design, was also sometimes referred to as Mark 2. Also cancelled 1944.

Armchair revolutionary,"Armchair revolutionary (or armchair activist and armchair socialist) is a description, often pejorative, of a speaker or writer who professes radical aims without taking any action to realize them, as if pontificating ""from the comfort of the armchair"". The term is one of a family of ""armchair experts"" or ""armchair theorists"", such as the armchair warrior or armchair general.

Examples
In 1937, Nikolai Berdyaev wrote: ""After years of living in Western Europe, Plekhanov became entirely a Western and of a very rationalist sort, fairly cultured, although his culture was not of the highest kind; more of an armchair revolutionary than a practical one. He could be a leader of a Marxist school of thought, but he could not be a leader of a revolution; that was made clear at the time of the revolution"".: 94 
Columnist Julie Burchill highlighted the relative level of energy exhibited in this lede: ""During a long hard winter, nothing warms the cold blood of the Western armchair revolutionary more than the sight of a bunch of attractive dark-skinned people out on the streets having a right old revolution"".
Left Communists have frequently been accused of armchair practices by the more Marxist-Leninist wings of Marxist movements. Amadeo Bordiga, a notable Italian left communist, particularly has been ascribed this title due to his frequent critique of the Soviet economic model.

In culture
The Guardian used the cliche in this headline: ""We’re a nation of armchair activists—and that's OK, says Bridget Christie"".
William Graham titled his travel book Latin America: Notes from an Armchair Revolutionary.
In December 2014, The BMJ published a study, possibly satirical in intent and described as ""lighthearted"" in NHS Choices, with the purported purpose of determining how political affiliation correlates with literal physical activity levels. The study's stated conclusion was that literal ""armchair socialists"" as a class do not exist as holders of political views toward either end of the spectrum (left or right) tend to be more physically active than political centrists.

Seriousness check,"The seriousness check is a technique that can be used in online research (also called Internet-based research, Web-based research, Web-based experiments) to improve data quality. Nowadays, many scientific studies with human participants are conducted online and are accessible to a large diversity of participants. Nonetheless, many people just want to look at the different pages of the questionnaire, instead of giving carefully chosen answers to the questions. The seriousness check addresses this problem: In this approach the respondents are asked about the seriousness of their participation or for a probability estimate that they will complete the entire study or experiment. Thus, by using the seriousness check irrelevant data entries can be easily identified and be excluded from the data analysis.

Method
Seriousness checks can be implemented both before  and after  participation in the study. However, it has been shown that the seriousness check is a good predictor of dropout rates when implemented in the first page of the experiment.
There are Web-based tools, e.g. WEXTOR, that implement the seriousness check by default.

Impact
Several studies have shown that performing a seriousness check at the start of a study best predicts motivation and dropout probability. It was observed that of those answering “I would like to look at the pages only"" around 75% will drop, while of those answering “I would like to seriously participate now"" only ca. 10-15% will drop during the study. Overall, about 30-50% of visitors will fail the seriousness check, i.e. answer “I would like to look at the pages only"". Moreover, it was found that emphasizing seriousness increased information seeking in participants and the time they spent on the study. Following up on this, it was shown that motivation and self-reported seriousness significantly predict several data quality indicators

Nicomedia,"Nicomedia (; Greek: Νικομήδεια, Nikomedeia; modern İzmit) was an ancient Greek city located in what is now Turkey. In 286, Nicomedia became the eastern and most senior capital city of the Roman Empire (chosen by the emperor Diocletian who ruled in the east), a status which the city maintained during the Tetrarchy system (293–324). 
The Tetrarchy ended with the Battle of Chrysopolis (Üsküdar) in 324, when Constantine defeated Licinius and became the sole emperor. In 330 Constantine chose for himself the nearby Byzantium (which was renamed Constantinople, modern Istanbul) as the new capital of the Roman Empire.
The city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the victory of Sultan Orhan Gazi against the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines managed to retake it in the aftermath of the Battle of Ankara, but it fell definitively to the Ottomans in 1419.

History
It was founded in 712–711 BC as a Megarian colony and was originally known as Astacus (; Ancient Greek: Ἀστακός, 'lobster'). After being destroyed by Lysimachus, it was rebuilt by Nicomedes I of Bithynia in 264 BC under the name of Nicomedia, and has ever since been one of the most important cities in northwestern Asia Minor. The great military commander Hannibal Barca came to Nicomedia in his final years and committed suicide in nearby Libyssa (Diliskelesi, Gebze). The historian Arrian was born there.

Nicomedia was the metropolis and capital of the Roman province of Bithynia under the Roman Empire. It is referenced repeatedly in Pliny the Younger's Epistles to Trajan during his tenure as governor of Bithynia. Pliny, in his letters, mentions several public buildings of the city such as a senate-house, an aqueduct, a forum, a temple of Cybele, and others, and speaks of a great fire, during which the place suffered much. Diocletian made it the eastern capital city of the Roman Empire in 286 when he introduced the Tetrarchy system.

Persecutions of 303
Nicomedia was at the center of the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians which occurred under Diocletian and his Caesar Galerius. On 23 February 303 AD, the pagan festival of the Terminalia, Diocletian ordered that the newly built church at Nicomedia be razed, its scriptures burnt, and its precious stones seized. The next day he issued his ""First Edict Against the Christians,"" which ordered similar measures to be taken at churches across the Empire.
The destruction of the Nicomedia church incited panic in the city, and at the end of the month a fire destroyed part of Diocletian's palace, followed 16 days later by another fire. Although an investigation was made into the cause of the fires, no party was officially charged, but Galerius placed the blame on the Christians. He oversaw the execution of two palace eunuchs, who he claimed conspired with the Christians to start the fire, followed by six more executions through the end of April 303. Soon after Galerius declared Nicomedia to be unsafe and ostentatiously departed the city for Rome, follow",history
Terminology of alternative medicine,"Alternative medicine is a term often used to describe medical practices where are untested or untestable. Complementary medicine (CM), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), integrated medicine or integrative medicine (IM), functional medicine, and holistic medicine are among many rebrandings of the same phenomenon.

Terms for alternative medicine
The terms alternative medicine, complementary medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, natural medicine, unorthodox medicine, fringe medicine, unconventional medicine, and new age medicine are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in most contexts.

There is concern that a lack of stabilized terminology for these practices may give the appearance of effectiveness. Loose terminology may also be used to suggest  that a dichotomy exists when it does not, e.g., the use of the expressions ""Western medicine"" and ""Eastern medicine"" to suggest that the difference is a cultural difference between the Asiatic east and the European west, rather than that the difference is between evidence-based medicine and other forms of treatment.  
Some scholars adopt this ""Western"" and ""Eastern"" language. For example, in a study done on musculoskeletal pain acupuncture treatment, researchers use the term “Western Acupuncture”, which is defined as the acupuncture practices that are evidence based. This term also removes the cultural connotations that are used in acupuncture such as ""qi"", or ""primordial energy"".

Complementary or integrative medicine
Complementary medicine (CM) or integrative medicine (IM) is when alternative medicine is used together with mainstream medical treatment, in a belief that it improves the effect of treatments. For example, acupuncture (piercing the body with needles to influence the flow of a supernatural energy) might be believed to increase the effectiveness or ""complement"" science-based medicine when used at the same time. Instead, significant drug interactions caused by alternative therapies may make treatments less effective, notably in cancer therapy. Integrative medicine has been described as an attempt to bring pseudoscience into academic science-based medicine. Due to its many names, the field has been criticized by writer Rose Shapiro for what she describes as intense rebranding of what are essentially the same practices.
CAM is an abbreviation of the phrase complementary and alternative medicine. The 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) Global Report on Traditional and Complementary Medicine states that the terms complementary and alternative medicine ""refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own traditional or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health care system. They are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries.""

Nippers,"Nippers are young surf lifesavers, usually aged between 5 and 14 years old, in clubs across Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.  Unlike senior surf lifesavers, the majority of them do not patrol the beaches. The focus for Nippers tends to be on fun, and surf awareness.
Nippers learn about safety at the beach.  They learn about dangers such as rocks, animals (e.g. the blue-ringed octopus), and surf conditions, such as rip currents, sandbars, and waves.  Older Nippers also learn some basic first aid and may also learn CPR when they reach the age of 13.
When Nippers are thirteen years old they can complete their SRC (Surf Rescue Certificate), enabling them to patrol beaches and partake in Senior Competition.
Like their Senior counterparts, Nippers participate in regular competition against other Surf Lifesaving Clubs, at sports carnivals.  Nippers are able to participate in a variety of Individual and Team events, including beach sprints, Flags, swimming and board races, relays, March Past, etc.  Unlike Seniors, Nippers do not compete in surf ski or surfboat races, and they also use shorter surfboards than their Senior counterparts.  Nippers start to compete when they are in the Under 8s age group.
The name and availability of the preschool-age group varies from club to club. These groups, sometimes called Tiny Tots or ""Beach Worms"", do not compete or learn first aid and surf awareness.  Tiny Tots' activities include games, wading and paddling.

Australia
The first Nippers club in Australia was started by Nambucca Heads Surf Life Saving Club, on the New South Wales mid-north coast, in 1961.

Game theory,"Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions. It has applications in many fields of social science, and is used extensively in economics, logic, systems science and computer science. Initially, game theory addressed two-person zero-sum games, in which a participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant. In the 1950s, it was extended to the study of non zero-sum games, and was eventually applied to a wide range of behavioral relations. It is now an umbrella term for the science of rational decision making in humans, animals, and computers.
Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944), co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.
Game theory was developed extensively in the 1950s, and was explicitly applied to evolution in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for his application of evolutionary game theory in 1999, and fifteen game theorists have won the Nobel Prize in economics as of 2020, including most recently Paul Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson.

History
Earliest results
In 1713, a letter attributed to Charles Waldegrave, an active Jacobite and uncle to British diplomat James Waldegrave, analyzed a game called ""le her"". Waldegrave provided a minimax mixed strategy solution to a two-person version of the card game, and the problem is now known as the Waldegrave problem.
In 1838, Antoine Augustin Cournot provided a model of competition in oligopolies. Though he did not refer to it as such, he presented a solution that is the Nash equilibrium of the game in his Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses (Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth). In 1883, Joseph Bertrand critiqued Cournot's model as unrealistic, providing an alternative model of price competition which would later be formalized by Francis Ysidro Edgeworth.
In 1913, Ernst Zermelo published Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels (On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of the Game of Chess), which proved that the optimal chess strategy is strictly determined.

Artificial intelligence content detection,"Artificial intelligence detection software aims to determine whether some content (text, image, video or audio) was generated using artificial intelligence (AI).
However, the reliability of such software is a topic of debate, and there are concerns about the potential misapplication of AI detection software by educators.

Accuracy issues
Multiple AI detection tools have been demonstrated to be unreliable in terms of accurately and comprehensively detecting AI-generated text. In a study conducted by Weber-Wulff et al., and published in 2023, researchers evaluated 14 detection tools including Turnitin and GPT Zero, and found that ""all scored below 80% of accuracy and only 5 over 70%.""

False positives and false negatives
In AI content detection, a false positive is when human-written work is incorrectly flagged as AI-written. Many AI detection software claim to have a minimal level of false positives, with Turnitin claiming a less than 1% false positive rate. However, later research by The Washington Post produced much higher rates of 50% albeit they used a smaller sample size. False positives in an academic setting frequently lead to accusations of academic misconduct, which can have serious consequences for a student's academic record. Additionally, studies have shown evidence that many AI detection models are prone to give false positives to work written by those whose first language isn't English and neurodiverse people.
A false negative is a failure to identify documents with AI-written text. False negatives often happen as a result of a detection software's sensitivity level or because evasive techniques were used when generating the work to make it sound more human. False negatives are less of a concern academically, since they aren't likely to lead to accusations and ramifications. Notably, Turnitin stated they have a 15% false negative rate.

Text detection
For text, this is usually done to prevent alleged plagiarism, often by detecting repetition of words as telltale signs that a text was AI-generated (including AI hallucinations). They are often used by teachers marking their students, usually on an ad hoc basis. Following the release of ChatGPT and similar AI text generative software, many educational establishments have issued policies against the use of AI by students. AI text detection software is also used by those assessing job applicants, as well as online search engines.
Current detectors may sometimes be unreliable and have incorrectly marked work by humans as originating from AI while failing to detect AI-generated work in other instances. MIT Technology Review said that the technology ""struggled to pick up ChatGPT-generated text that had been slightly rearranged by humans and obfuscated by a paraphrasing tool"". AI text detection software has also been shown to discriminate against non-native speakers of English.

French school of fencing,"The known history of fencing in France begins in the 16th century, with the adoption of Italian styles of fencing.
There are medieval predecessors, such as the Burgundian Le jeu de la hache (""The Play of the Axe"") of ca. 1400, but the history of the classical French school begins with the foundation of  the Académie des Maistres en faits d’armes de l’Académie du Roy (also known as the École française d’Escrime) by Charles IX of France in December 1567.
One master produced by this school was Henry de Saint-Didier, author of a 1573 treatise titled Traicté contenant les secrets du premier livre sur l'espee seule (Treatise containing the secrets of the first book on the single sword), dedicated to Charles IX.

Rapier treatises are known from the early seventeenth century, such as François Dancie's Discours des armes et methode pour bien tirer de l'espée et poignard (c.1610) and L'espée de combat (1623) and André Desbordes' Discours de la théorie et de la pratique de l'excellence des armes (1610), with both authors citing the Italian origins of their systems. Earlier, in 1597, the great traveller Seigneur de Villamont translated Girolamo Cavalcabo of Bologna’s treatise into French, along with a shorter piece by Paternostrier of Rome.
Fencing in France was developed into a sport during the 17th century, with codification of rules and terminology and a system of teaching. Cesar Cavalcabo from Italy and son of Italian fencing master Hieronymus was invited to teach the great fencing tradition of Bologna to the future Louis XIII, and has influenced the development of French swordplay in the early seventeenth century. Also, the art of fencing in France was taught by local masters such as Le Perche du Coudray (1635, 1676, teacher of Cyrano de Bergerac), Besnard (1653, teacher of Descartes), Philibert de la Touche (1670) and L'Abbat of Toulouse (1690, 1696).

The modern foil was developed in France as a training technique in the middle of the 18th century; it provided practice of fast and elegant thrust fencing with a smaller and safer weapon than an actual dueling sword. Fencers blunted (or ""foiled"") its point by wrapping a foil around the blade or fastening a knob on the point (fleuret, ""blossom"").
German students took up that practice and developed the Pariser (""Parisian"") thrusting small sword for their academic fencing bouts.
By the 18th century, the French school had become the western European standard to the extent, that Domenico Angelo, an Italian-born master teaching in England,  published his L'école des Armes in French in 1763. It was extremely successful and became a standard fencing manual over the following 50 years, throughout the Napoleonic period. Angelo's text was so influential that it was chosen to be included under the heading of ""Éscrime"" in Diderot's Encyclopédie.
The emergence of classical sports fencing in the 19th century was a direct continuation of the French tradition.

Alpine climbing,"Alpine climbing (German: Alpinklettern) is a type of mountaineering that uses any of a broad range of advanced climbing skills, including rock climbing, ice climbing, and/or mixed climbing, to summit typically large routes (e.g. multi-pitch or big wall) in an alpine environment. While alpine climbing began in the European Alps, it is used to refer to climbing in any remote mountainous area, including in the Himalayas and Patagonia. The derived term alpine style refers to the fashion of alpine climbing to be in small lightly equipped teams who carry their equipment (e.g. no porters), and do all of the climbing (e.g. no sherpas or reserve teams).
Alpinists face a wide range of serious risks in addition to the specific risks of rock, ice, and mixed climbing. This includes the risks of rockfalls (common with rock faces in alpine environments), avalanches (especially in couloirs), seracs and crevasses, violent storms hitting climbers on exposed mountain faces, altitude effects (dehydration, edema, frostbite), complex navigation and route finding, long abseils, and the difficulty of rescue and/or retreat due to the remote setting. Due to the scale of the routes, alpine climbers need to be able to move together for speed (e.g. simul climbing or as rope teams), which is another source of specific risk.
The first ""golden age"" of modern alpine climbing was the first free ascents–in summer, in winter, and as solo–of the great north faces of the Alps by pioneers such as Walter Bonatti, Riccardo Cassin and Gaston Rebuffat. The subsequent era, which is still ongoing, is focused on the equivalent ascents and enchainments, of the ice and snow-covered faces and ridges of major Himalayan peaks (e.g. the eight-thousanders, Latok, The Ogre) and Patagonian peaks (e.g. Cerro Torre Group, Fitz Roy Group) in ""alpine style"" by pioneers such as Hermann Buhl, Reinhold Messner and Doug Scott, and latterly by alpinists such as Ueli Steck, Mick Fowler, Paul Ramsden, and Marko Prezelj. The annual Piolets d'Or are awarded for the best achievements in alpine climbing.

Description
Alpine climbing involves small unsupported teams tackling large multi-pitch (or big wall) routes that can involve various combinations of rock climbing, ice climbing, and mixed climbing, in alpine-type mountain environments.  Alpine routes are often long and require a full day of climbing or even several days.  Because of the length of the routes, and the danger of alpine environments (e.g. rockfall, avalanche, altitude, weather, etc.), alpine climbers (or ""alpinists"") typically try routes that are well within their technical rock, ice, or mixed climbing capabilities.
While parts of an alpine route will involve a lead climber tackling difficult rock, ice, or mixed sections while being belayed by a stationary second climber below, parts will involve both climbers moving simultaneously together as a rope team, particularly on large snow slopes or easier rock sections. Simultaneous climbing (or simul clim",sports
Ballot title,"A ballot title is the official, short, summary of a referendum that appears on the ballot.  The goal of a good ballot title is to be a neutral summary that accurately conveys to voters the gist of what the proposed new law says or would do. The National Conference of State Legislatures says, ""The ballot title and summary are arguably the most important part of an initiative in terms of voter education. Most voters never read more than the title and summary of the text of initiative proposals. Therefore, it is of critical importance that titles and summaries be concise, accurate and impartial.""

United States
Differences between states
One way that states differ in laws governing the initiative process has to do with whether the ballot title is determined before signatures are collected, or after.
Another way that states differ has to do with whether the ballot title is determined by the government (which could be a commission, a ballot title determination board, the Secretary of State, or some other election official) or whether the ballot title is determined by the political organization that is advocating for the measure.

Pre-circulation ballot titles
States where the ballot title is set prior to circulation include:
Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon (In Oregon, the ballot title is set after 1,000 initial sponsorship signatures have been submitted) and Washington.

Post-circulation ballot titles
States where the ballot title is determined by the government after the signatures have been collected are:
Arizona, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, Wyoming.

History of Chiloé,"The history of Chiloé, an archipelago in Chile's south, has been marked by its geographic and political isolation. The archipelago has been described by Renato Cárdenas, historian at the Chilean National Library, as “a distinct enclave, linked more to the sea than the continent, a fragile society with a strong sense of solidarity and a deep territorial attachment.”

First inhabitants
Chiloé's history began with the arrival of its first human inhabitants more than 7,000 years ago. Spread along the coast of Chiloé Island are a number of middens - ancient dumps for domestic waste, containing mollusc shells, stone tools and bonfire remains. Occasionally skeletons of marine birds have been found and in some cases, human skeletons. All of these remains indicate the presence of nomadic groups dedicated to the collection of marine creatures (clams, mussels and choromytilus chorus, among others) and to hunting and fishing. Among remains found on these sites are chopping tools, lithic flakes, hand axes as well as some objects made of bone. The older middens have been dated to 5,900BC and some of these remain in use, as the local communities use them as modern rubbish dumps.

When the Spanish conquistadores arrived on Chiloé Island in the 16th Century, the island was inhabited by the Chono, Huilliche and Cunco peoples. The original peoples navigated the treacherous waters of the Chiloé Archipelago in boats called dalcas with skill that impressed the Spaniards. Their diet consisted of cooked vegetables such as potatoes and corn, with a wide variety of fish and seafood.

Spanish conquest and colonization
The first Spaniard to sight the coast of Chiloé was the explorer Alonso de Camargo in 1540, as he was travelling to Peru. However, in an expedition ordered by Pedro de Valdivia, captain Francisco de Ulloa reached the Chacao Channel in 1553 and explored the islands forming the archipelago, and is thus considered the first discoverer of Chiloé. In 1558, Spanish soldier García Hurtado de Mendoza began an expedition which would culminate in the Chiloé archipelago being claimed for the Spanish crown.
The city of Castro was founded of 1567.
The island was originally called New Galicia by the Spanish discoverers,  but this name did not stick and the name Chiloé, meaning “place of seagulls” in the Huilliche language, was given to the island.
In 1600 the Dutch corsair Baltazar de Cordes occupied Castro, but the Spaniards recaptured the city. In 1643, a Dutch expedition to Valdivia, led by Hendrik Brouwer, attacked and occupied Chiloé. 
Jesuit missionaries to Chiloé Island, charged with the evangelization of the local population arrived on Chiloé at the turn of the 17th century and built a number of chapels throughout the archipelago. By 1767 there were already 79 and today more than 150 wooden churches built in traditional style can be found on the islands, many of these declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Following the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767, the Franc",history
Body neutrality,"The concept of body neutrality encourages the mindset that a person's bodily appearance, and attitudes towards it, should have the least possible effect on their experience of life. Its proponents assert that people should neither be celebrated for their conformance with an ideal of bodily beauty nor criticised for departure from such a condition. It may be contrasted with Body positivity, the Fat acceptance movement, Lookism, and body shaming. Some explanations of the concept emphasise a body's functionality over its aesthetics.
Amongst its better-known adherents are Erynn Chambers and Bethany C. Meyers.

Agricultural attaché,"An agricultural attaché is a diplomat who collects, analyzes, and acts on information on agriculture, agribusiness, food, and other related spheres in a foreign country or countries. Agricultural attachés may be directly employed by the sending country's agriculture ministry, or they may be employed by the foreign ministry. Typical activities of an agricultural attaché include reporting on crop conditions, food availability, domestic agricultural policy and the foreign trade outlook in agricultural products; negotiating food aid agreements and agricultural credit lines; implementing agricultural technical assistance programs; facilitating professional contacts, exchanges, and technology transfer; assisting in negotiating bilateral and multilateral trade agreements; and promoting the exports of agricultural and food products. In many cases, agricultural attachés may also bear responsibility for issues related to the environment, food security, food safety, fisheries, forestry, and indeed anything related to rural areas and the rural economy.

Diplomatic status
The emergence of agricultural attachés with diplomatic status grew out of the posting of agricultural commissioners in the 19th century. In modern times, although the term ""agricultural attaché"" is commonly applied to diplomats responsible for agricultural affairs, these diplomats often possess other, higher diplomatic titles and ranks, up to and including the rank of minister-counselor.
Often, agricultural officers of foreign embassies will form an informal group to compare notes and to collaborate on issues of mutual interest with regard to the host country.  In Washington, D.C., for example, foreign embassies' agricultural attachés created the Agricultural Counselors Forum in the 1970s.

Responsibilities
Originally, agricultural attachés primarily bore responsibility for reporting on agricultural and rural conditions in the host country and other countries in a multi-country area of responsibility. In 1934, U.S. agricultural attachés began supporting trade negotiations.  During and after World War II, their responsibilities expanded to include oversight and management of food assistance, credit, and technical assistance programs.
Today an ""agricultural attaché"" may have other responsibilities as well, related to environmental affairs, arrangement of international credit lines, or consumer protection. For example, in Washington, D.C., the Austrian Embassy features a ""Counselor (Agriculture and Environment)"", the Royal Thai Embassy has an officer responsible for ""Organic Food and Agriculture"", and the German Embassy includes a minister-counselor for ""Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection"".
In virtually all cases, agricultural attachés fall under authority of the chief of the diplomatic mission (ambassador or chargé d'affaires) so that in addition to answering to their respective agriculture ministries, they also must report to the chief of mission. As an example, under U.S. law, this du",economics
Carom billiards,"Carom billiards, also called French billiards and sometimes carambole billiards, is the overarching title of a family of cue sports generally played on cloth-covered, pocketless billiard tables. In its simplest form, the object of the game is to score points or ""counts"" by caroming one's own cue ball off both the opponent's cue ball and the object ball on a single shot. The invention as well as the exact date of origin of carom billiards is somewhat obscure but is thought to be traceable to 18th-century France.
There is a large array of carom billiards disciplines. Some of the more prevalent today and historically are (chronologically by apparent date of development): straight rail, one-cushion, balkline, three-cushion and artistic billiards.
Carom billiards is popular in Europe, particularly France, where it originated. It is also popular in Asian countries, including Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Vietnam, but is now considered obscure in North America, having been supplanted by pool in popularity. The Union Mondiale de Billard (UMB) is the highest international governing body of competitive carom billiards.

Etymology
The word carom, which simply means any strike and rebound, was in use in reference to billiards by at least 1779, sometimes spelled ""carrom"".: 41  Sources differ on the origin. It has been pegged variously as a shortening of the Spanish and Portuguese word carambola, or the French word carambole, which are used to describe the red object ball. Some etymologists have suggested that carambola, in turn, was derived from a yellow-to-orange, tropical Asian fruit also known in Portuguese as a carambola (which was a corruption of the original name of the fruit, karambal in the Marathi language of India), also known as star fruit. But this may simply be folk etymology, as the fruit bears no resemblance to a billiard ball, and there is no direct evidence for such a derivation.
In modern French, the word carambolage means 'successive collision', currently used mainly in reference to carom or cannon shots in billiards, and to multiple-vehicle car crashes.

Equipment
Table
The billiard table used for carom billiards is a pocketless version and is typically 3.0 by 1.5 metres (10 ft × 5 ft).
Most cloth made for carom billiard tables is a type of baize that is typically dyed green and is made from 100% worsted wool with no nap, which provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel with little resistance across the table bed.
The slate bed of a carom billiard table is often heated to about 5 °C (9 °F) above room temperature, which helps to keep moisture out of the cloth to aid the balls rolling and rebounding in a consistent manner, and generally makes a table play faster. An electrically heated table is required under international tournament rules 'in order to ensure the best possible rolling', although temperatures are not specified. It is an especially important requirement for the games of three-cushion billiards and art",sports
Organoid intelligence,"Organoid intelligence (OI) is an emerging field of study in computer science and biology that develops and studies biological wetware computing using 3D cultures of human brain cells (or brain organoids) and brain-machine interface technologies. Such technologies may be referred to as OIs.

Differences with non-organic computing
As opposed to traditional non-organic silicon-based approaches, OI seeks to use lab-grown cerebral organoids to serve as ""biological hardware."" Scientists hope that such organoids can provide faster, more efficient, and more powerful computing power than regular silicon-based computing and AI while requiring only a fraction of the energy. However, while these structures are still far from being able to think like a regular human brain and do not yet possess strong computing capabilities, OI research currently offers the potential to improve the understanding of brain development, learning and memory, potentially finding treatments for neurological disorders such as dementia.
Thomas Hartung, a professor from Johns Hopkins University, argues that ""while silicon-based computers are certainly better with numbers, brains are better at learning."" Furthermore, he claimed that with ""superior learning and storing"" capabilities than AIs, being more energy efficient, and that in the future, it might not be possible to add more transistors to a single computer chip, while brains are wired differently and have more potential for storage and computing power, OIs can potentially harness more power than current computers.
Some researchers claim that even though human brains are slower than machines at processing simple information, they are far better at processing complex information as brains can deal with fewer and more uncertain data, perform both sequential and parallel processing, being highly heterogenous, use incomplete datasets, and is said to outperform non-organic machines in decision-making.
Training OIs involve the process of biological learning (BL) as opposed to machine learning (ML) for AIs. BL is said to be much more energy efficient than ML.

Bioinformatics in OI
OI generates complex biological data, necessitating sophisticated methods for processing and analysis. Bioinformatics provides the tools and techniques to decipher raw data, uncovering the patterns and insights. A Python interface is currently available for processing and interaction with brain organoids.

Intended functions
Brain-inspired computing hardware aims to emulate the structure and working principles of the brain and could be used to address current limitations in artificial intelligence technologies. However, brain-inspired silicon chips are still limited in their ability to fully mimic brain function, as most examples are built on digital electronic principles. One study performed OI computation (which they termed Brainoware) by sending and receiving information from the brain organoid using a high-density multielectrode array.

Agricultural policy,"Agricultural policy describes a set of laws relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Well designed agricultural policies use predetermined goals, objectives and pathways set by an individual or government for the purpose of achieving a specified outcome, for the benefit of the individual(s), society and the nations' economy at large. The goals could include issues such as biosecurity, food security, rural poverty reduction or increasing economic value through cash crop or improved food distribution or food processing.
Agricultural policies take into consideration the primary (production), secondary (such as food processing, and distribution) and tertiary processes (such as consumption and supply in agricultural products and supplies). Outcomes can involve, for example, a guaranteed supply level, price stability, product quality, product selection, land use or employment. Governments can use tools like rural development practices, agricultural extension, economic protections, agricultural subsidies or price controls to change the dynamics of agricultural production, or improve the consumer impacts of the production.
Agricultural policy has wide reaching primary and secondary effects. Agriculture has large impacts on climate change, estimated to be contributing 20–25% of global annual emissions as of 2010. Moreover, agricultural policy needs to account for a lot of shocks to the system: for example, agriculture is highly vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change, such as decreases in water access, geophysical processes such as ocean level rise and changing weather, and socioeconomic processes that affect farmers, many of whom are in subsistence economic conditions. In order for global climate change mitigation and adaptation to be effective a wide range of policies need to be implemented to reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector.

Agriculture policy concerns
An example of the breadth and types of agriculture policy concerns can be found in the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics article ""Agricultural Economies of Australia and New Zealand"" which says that the major challenges and issues faced by their industrial agriculture industry are:

marketing challenges and consumer tastes

Free World,"The Free World is a propaganda term, primarily used during the Cold War from 1945 to 1991, to refer to the Western Bloc and aligned countries.
The term refers more broadly to all liberal democracies collectively, as opposed to authoritarian regimes and communist states. It has traditionally primarily been used to refer to the countries allied and aligned with the United States, the European Union, and NATO. The term ""leader of the free world"" has been used to imply a symbolic and moral leadership, and was mostly used during the Cold War in reference to the president of the United States.

History of the concept
Origins
During World War II, the Allied powers viewed themselves as opposing the oppression and fascism of the Axis powers, thus making them ""free"". Following the end of World War II, the Cold War conception of the ""Free World"" included only anti-Soviet states as being ""free"", particularly democratically elected states with free speech, a free press, freedom of assembly and freedom of association.
During the Cold War, many neutral countries, either those in what is considered the Third World, or those having no formal alliance with either the United States or the Soviet Union, viewed the claim of ""Free World"" leadership by the United States as grandiose and illegitimate.
One of the earliest uses of the term Free World as a politically significant term occurs in Frank Capra's World War II propaganda film series Why We Fight. In Prelude to War, the first film of that series, the ""free world"" is portrayed as a white planet, directly contrasted with the black planet called the ""slave world"". The film depicts the free world as the Western Hemisphere, led by the United States and Western Europe, and the slave world as the Eastern Hemisphere, dominated by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and the Japanese Empire.

21st century usage
While ""Free World"" had its origins in the Cold War, the phrase is still used after the end of the Cold War and during the Global War on Terrorism. Samuel P. Huntington said the term has been replaced by the concept of the international community, which, he argued, ""has become the euphemistic collective noun (replacing ""the Free World"") to give global legitimacy to actions reflecting the interests of the United States and other Western powers.""

Leadership of the Free World
United States
The ""Leader of the Free World"" was a colloquialism, first used during the Cold War, to describe either the United States or, more commonly, the president of the United States. The term when used in this context suggested that the United States was the principal democratic superpower, and the U.S. president was by extension the leader of the world's democratic states, i.e. the ""Free World"".

The phrase has its origin in the 1940s during the Second World War, especially through the anti-fascist Free World magazine and the American propaganda film series Why We Fight. At this time, the term was criticized for including the Soviet Union (USSR), ",politics
Polo,"Polo  is a ball game that is played on horseback as a traditional field sport. It is one of the world's oldest known team sports, having been adopted in the Western world from the game of Chovgan (Persian: چوگان), which originated in ancient Iran, dating back over 2,000 years. Initially played by Persian nobility as a training exercise for cavalry units, polo eventually spread to other parts of the world. The game is played by two opposing teams with the objective of scoring using a long-handled wooden mallet to hit a small hard ball through the opposing team's goal. Each team has four mounted riders, and the game usually lasts one to two hours, divided into periods called chukkas or chukkers.
Polo has been called ""The Sport of Kings"" and has become a spectator sport for equestrians and high society, often supported by sponsorship. The progenitor of polo and its variants existed from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD, as an equestrian game played by the Iranian peoples. From Iran, where the sport evolved and developed, the game became popular around the world, with well over 100 member countries in the Federation of International Polo, and is played professionally in 16 countries; it was also an Olympic sport from 1900 to 1936.
Arena polo is an indoor or semi-outdoor variant with similar rules, and is played with three riders per team. The playing field is smaller, enclosed and usually of compacted sand or fine aggregate. Arena polo has more maneuvering due to space limitations, and uses an air-inflated ball slightly larger than the hard solid ball used in field polo. Standard mallets are used, though slightly larger-head arena mallets are an option.
Mastery in Horseriding is a must to play this game. There are also risks of injuries [mainly from falling from the horse], therefore one should be physically active and strong.

History
Origins and etymology
The game was originally invented by Iranians and its Persian name is ""Chovgan"" (čowgān). The game's English name derives from the Balti language, from its word for 'ball', polo. It is cognate with the Standard Tibetan pulu, also meaning 'ball'.: 25 
Many scholars suggest it most likely began as a simple game played by the Iranian people. An archaic variation of polo, regionally referred to as buzkashi or kokpar, is still played in parts of Central Asia. It was developed and formalised in Ancient Iran (Persia) as ""chovgan"" (čowgān), becoming a national sport played extensively by the nobility. Women played as well as men. During the period of the Parthian Empire (247 BC to AD 224), the sport had great patronage under the kings and noblemen. According to The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity,  the Persian ball game was an important pastime in the court of the Sasanian Empire (224–651). It was also part of the royal education for the Sasanian ruling class. Emperor Shapur II learnt to play polo at age seven in 316 AD.

Confrontation analysis,"Confrontation analysis (also known as dilemma analysis) is an operational analysis technique used to structure, understand and think through multi-party interactions such as negotiations. It is the underpinning mathematical basis of drama theory. 
It is derived from game theory but considers that instead of resolving the game, the players often redefine the game when interacting. Emotions triggered from the potential interaction play a large part in this redefinition. So whereas game theory looks on an interaction as a single decision matrix and resolves that, confrontation analysis looks on the interaction as a sequence of linked interactions, where the decision matrix changes under the influence of precisely defined emotional dilemmas.

Derivation and use
Confrontation analysis was devised by Professor Nigel Howard in the early 1990s drawing from his work on game theory and metagame analysis. It has been turned to defence, political, legal, financial and commercial applications.

Much of the theoretical background to General Rupert Smith's book The Utility of Force drew its inspiration from the theory of confrontation analysis.I am in debt to Professor Nigel Howard, whose explanation of Confrontation Analysis and Game Theory at a seminar in 1998 excited my interest. Our subsequent discussions helped me to order my thoughts and the lessons I had learned into a coherent structure with the result that, for the first time, I was able to understand my experiences within a theoretical model which allowed me to use them further
Confrontation analysis can also be used in a decision workshop as structure to support role-playing for training, analysis and decision rehearsal.

Method
Confrontation analysis looks on an interaction as a sequence of confrontations. During each confrontation the parties communicate until they have made their positions clear to one another.  These positions can be expressed as a card table (also known as an options board) of yes/no decisions. For each decision each party communicates what they would like to happen (their position) and what will happen if they cannot agree (the threatened future). These interactions produce dilemmas and the card table changes as players attempt to eliminate these.

Consider the example on the right (Initial Card Table), taken from the 1995 Bosnian Conflict. This represents an interaction between the Bosnian Serbs and the United Nations forces over the safe areas. The Bosnian Serbs had Bosniak enclaves surrounded and were threatening to attack.
Each side had a position as to what they wanted to happen:
The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):

To be able to attack the enclaves
NOT to withdraw their heavy weapons from the enclaves
For the UN NOT to use air strikes

The Blue Economy,"The Blue Economy: 10 years – 100 innovations – 100 million jobs is a book by Gunter Pauli. The book expresses the ultimate aim that a ""Blue Economy business model"" will shift society from scarcity to abundance ""with what is locally available"", by tackling issues that cause environmental and related problems in new ways.

Contents
The book highlights potential benefits in connecting and combining seemingly disparate environmental problems with open-source scientific solutions based upon physical processes common in the natural world, to create solutions that are both environmentally beneficial and which have financial and wider social benefits.  The book suggests that we can alter the way in which we run our industrial processes and tackle resultant environmental problems, refocusing from the use of rare and high-energy cost resources to instead seek solutions based upon simpler and cleaner technologies.  The book proposes to focus on the generation of more value, instead of blindly cutting costs. The book aims to inspire entrepreneurs to adopt its insights, by demonstrating ways in which this can create economic benefits via job creation, reduced energy use, and more revenue streams from each step of the process, at the same time benefiting the communities involved.
The Blue Economy is presented in 14 chapters, each of which investigates an aspect of the world's economies and offers a series of innovations capable of making aspects of those economies sustainable. By 2014, the book has been translated into 35 languages worldwide.

Economics of terrorism,"The economics of terrorism is a branch of economics dedicated to the study of terrorism. It involves using the tools of economic analysis to analyse issues related to terrorism, such as the link between education, poverty and terrorism, the effect of macroeconomic conditions on the frequency and quality of terrorism, the economic costs of terrorism, and the economics of counter-terrorism. The field also extends to the political economy of terrorism, which seeks to answer questions on the effect of terrorism on voter preferences and party politics.
Research has extensively examined the relationship between economics and terrorism, but both scholars and policy makers have often struggled to reach a consensus on the role that economics plays in causing terrorism, and how exactly economic considerations could prove useful in understanding and combatting terrorism.

Introduction
The study of terrorism economics dates back to a 1978 study by William Landes, who conducted research into what acted as effective deterrents for airplane hijackings. Looking at aircraft hijacking trends in the US between 1961 and 1976, Landes found that the reduction in the number of hijackings after 1972 was associated with the introduction of mandatory screening systems, the increased chance of apprehension and harsher criminal penalties. He forecasted that if mandatory screening was not in place, and if the probability of apprehension remained equal to its 1972 value, there would have been between 41 and 67 additional hijacking between 1973 and 1976.
Since the attack on the World Trade Center, there have been many more empirical and theoretical contributions that have helped to expand the field. Notably, Alan Krueger and Jitka Maleckova published a paper in 2003 that demonstrated little relationship between poverty and terrorism, in contrast to the common wisdom following 9/11.

Definition of terrorism
Scholars and politicians alike have struggled to agree on a universal definition of terrorism. Terrorism expert Jessica Stern asserts that ""the student of terrorism is confronted with hundreds of definitions in the literature."" However, over this period, scholars dedicated to the study of the economics of terrorism have converged to a standard definition that is frequently used for economic research. It is based on the definition employed by the US State Department, and is primarily used because it uses concrete language, and avoids phrases that create ambiguity in classification, like ""often"" and ""especially.""

“The term ‘terrorism’ means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against non-combatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.”

Poverty as cause of terrorism
For many years, the common wisdom was that poverty and ignorance (i.e. lack of education) was the root cause of terrorist activity. This opinion was once held by politicians across both sides of the aisl",economics
Economics of corruption,"Economics of corruption deals with the misuse of public power for private benefit and its economic impact on society. This discipline aims to study the causes and consequences of corruption and how it affects the economic functioning of the state.
Economies that are afflicted by a high level of corruption are not capable of prospering as fully as those with a low level of corruption. Corrupted economies cannot function properly since the natural laws of the economy are distorted. As a consequence, corruption, for instance, leads to an inefficient allocation of resources, poor education, and healthcare or the presence of a shadow economy - which includes illegal activities and unreported income from legal goods and services that should be taxed but are not.
One of the challenges of studying corruption lies is its definition. This might appear as a minor detail, but how we define corruption affects the way we model it and how we measure it. Although there are many definitions of what corruption is, most of them overlap over the central issue - ""the misuse of public office power for personal gain in an illegal manner"". Certain illegal activities such as fraud, money laundering, drug trade, and black market operations, do not necessarily amount to corruption if they do not involve the use of public power (bureaucracy). Another viable definition is as follows: corruption is an “arrangement” that involves “a private exchange between two parties (the ‘demander’ and the ‘supplier’), which (1) has an influence on the allocation of resources either immediately or in the future, and (2) involves the use or abuse of public or collective responsibility for private ends.”
The pervasiveness of corruption is a probabilistic measure and refers to the likelihood that an entering firm will encounter corruption in its dealings with government officials or politicians in the host country. A high level of pervasiveness indicates that firms are more likely to encounter corruption when undertaking normal business activities.
The study distinguishes two types of corruption: 1. Extortion: The demand of an official for a bribe under threat of harmful actions, or put him in such conditions under which he is forced to give a bribe in order to prevent harmful consequences for his law enforcement interest. 2. Collusion: When an authorized person takes a bribe for something they should not do, with both parties interested in the outcome.
The real damage from such corruption is often difficult to measure and can be many times more than officially reported figures.
Research on corruption faces a significant empirical obstacle – measurement. Corruption, by its nature, is illicit and secretive. Large portion of corruption is never discovered or prosecuted. Despite this challenge, researchers have made progress in addressing the level of corruption by attempting to measure the perception of corruption, rather than corruption itself.
As such, one way to objectively measure corruption",economics

Gridlock (politics),"In politics, gridlock or deadlock or political stalemate is a situation when there is difficulty passing laws that satisfy the needs of the people. A government is gridlocked when the ratio between bills passed and the agenda of the legislature decreases. Gridlock can occur when two legislative houses, or the executive branch and the legislature are controlled by different political parties, or otherwise cannot agree.
The word ""gridlock"" is used here as a metaphor – referring to the traffic standstill which results when congestion causes the flow to freeze up completely.

Proportional representation
In countries with proportional representation the formation of coalition governments or consensus governments is common. The veto player theory predicts that multiparty governments are likely to be gridlocked, while other literature shows empirical absence of increased gridlock.

Majoritarian representation
United States
In United States politics, gridlock frequently refers to occasions when the House of Representatives and the Senate are controlled by different parties, or by a different party than the party of the president. Gridlock may also occur within the Senate, when no party has a three-fifths filibuster-proof majority of 60 seats.
Political Gridlock by author Ned Witting identifies many of the causes of gridlock in the United States and outlines ways to get government working again.
Law professors such as Sanford Levinson and Adrian Vermeule, as well as political commentators such as Matthew Yglesias and Debbie Parks, have criticized the U.S. Constitution and Senate voting rules for enabling situations of legislative gridlock. Along these lines, David Brady, a professor of political science at Stanford University, and Craig Volden, a professor of public policy and politics at the University of Virginia, explain gridlock by pointing to two interrelated factors: first, ""the preferences of members of Congress regarding particular policies"" and second, ""supermajority institutions – the Senate filibuster and the presidential veto"". As a result, they argue, gridlock is not determined by party control of the government, but rather by an interplay between the existing policy and the spectrum of individual preferences held by congressional representatives. They maintain, in essence, that ""the policy preferences of Members of Congress at or near the median are among the crucial determinants of policy outcomes.""
Marcus Ethridge, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, argues in a 2011 policy analysis published by the libertarian Cato Institute that the U.S. Constitution was designed to foster gridlock in order to increase ""the likelihood that policies will reflect broad, unorganized interests instead of the interests of narrow, organized groups."" Ethridge presented an extended version of his analysis in The Case for Gridlock: Democracy, Organized Power, and the Legal Foundations of American Government (2010),",politics
Aid climbing,"Aid climbing is a form of rock climbing that uses mechanical devices and equipment, such as aiders (or ladders), for upward momentum. Aid climbing is contrasted with free climbing (in both its traditional or sport free climbing formats), which only uses mechanical equipment for protection, but not to assist in upward momentum.  Aid climbing can involve hammering in permanent pitons and bolts, into which the aiders are clipped, but there is also 'clean aid climbing' which avoids any hammering, and only uses removable placements.
While aid climbing traces its origins to the start of all climbing when ladders and pitons were common, its use in single-pitch climbing waned in the early 20th century with the rise of free climbing. At the same time, the Dolomites became the birthplace of modern ""big wall aid climbing"", where pioneers like Emilio Comici developed the early tools and techniques.  Aid climbing's ""golden age"" was in the 1960s and 1970s on Yosemite's granite big walls led by pioneers such as Royal Robbins and Warren Harding, and later Jim Bridwell, and was also where Robbins' ethos of minimal-aid, and Yvon Chouinard's ethos of clean aid climbing, became dominant.
In the 1990s, the traditional A-grading system was expanded at Yosemite into a more detailed ""new wave"" system, and with the development and growth in clean aid climbing, the A-grade became the C-grading system.  The grading of aid-climbing routes is complex as successive repeats can substantially change the nature of the challenge through hammering and also the build-up of large amounts of in-situ fixed placements.  It is not untypical for a new A5-graded aid-climbing route, to migrate to an A3-graded route over time.
Aid climbing is still used on large big wall climbing and alpine climbing routes to overcome sections of extreme difficulty that are beyond the difficulties of the rest of the route. A famous big wall climb such as The Nose on El Capitan is accessible to strong climbers as a partial-aid route graded VI 5.9 (5c) C2, but only a tiny handful can handle its 5.14a (8b+) grade as a free climbed route.  Aid is also used to develop ""next generation"" big wall routes (e.g. Riders on the Storm on Cordillera Paine, or the Grand Voyage on Trango Towers). Extreme C5-graded aid-only routes are also still being established, such as Nightmare on California Street  on El Capitan.

Description
Aid climbing is a form of rock climbing that uses mechanical devices and equipment for upward momentum. Like traditional and sport climbing, aid climbing is typically done in pairs with a lead climber making the ""placements"" into which ladders (known as aiders) are clipped, thus enabling them to ascend. After the lead climber has reached the top, the second climber (or belayer) then removes the placements as they jumar up the rope.
Traditional aid climbing relied on fixed placements, which were mainly metal pitons that the lead climber hammered into the rock as they ascended.  These placements rem",sports

Historical significance,"Historical significance is a historiographical key concept that explores and seeks to explain the selection of particular social and cultural past events for remembrance by human societies. This element of selection involved in both ascribing and analyzing historical significance is one factor in making the discipline of history distinct from the past. Historians consider knowledge of dates and events within and between specific historical periods the primary content of history, also known as ""first-order knowledge"" or substantive concepts. In contrast, historical significance is an example of a subject specific secondary key concept or ""second-order knowledge"" also known as a meta-concept, or disciplinary concept, which is typically used to help organize knowledge within a subject area, frame suitable areas of inquiry, provide the framework upon which substantive knowledge can be built, and map learner progression within a subject discipline. Specifically with regards to historical significance, the way dates and events are chosen and ascribed relative significance is not fixed and can change over time according to which criteria were used to form the judgement of significance as well as how those criteria were chosen themselves in the first place. This aspect to significance has been described as:
“a flexible relationship between us and the past”.    
Historical significance is often regarded as involving judging why a particular person or event is remembered and why another is not, it is this aspect of reasoned and evaluative judgement about historical significance that makes history writing differ from being simply a record of past events.   
""as soon as we turn to questions of significance—of why something happened versus the mere fact of its happening—history becomes an act of judgment.""   
This emphasis on exploring what has been deemed significant by certain societies in contrast to what has been left out of the historical record has led to historical significance often being paired with the concept of historical silence, which looks at why and how certain social class, racial, and/or ethnic groups have not featured in the historical record or whose contributions have not been seen as significant at particular times, and in particular contexts. Thus historical significance is not an intrinsic or fixed property of a particular historical event but rather more of an assessment of who, why, and how that event was judged significant enough to be remembered. With this potential fluidity in mind, it therefore follows that any assessment of historical significance should not be seen as fixed or permanent.  ""historical significance is not an enduring or unchanging characteristic of any particular event. It is a contingent quality that depends on the perspective from which that event is subsequently viewed.""

Cabotage,"Cabotage () is the transport of goods or passengers between two places in the same country. The term originally applied to shipping along coastal routes, port to port, but now applies to aviation, railways, and road transport as well.
Cabotage rights are the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country, particularly to carry passengers and cargo from one point in the other country directly to another point in the same country. Most countries do not permit aviation cabotage, and there are strict sanctions against it, for reasons of economic protectionism, national security, or public safety. One notable exception is the European Union, whose member states all grant cabotage rights to each other.

Etymology
The term ""cabotage"" is borrowed from French. It is derived from caboter which means ""to travel along the coast"". The origin of caboter is obscure: it may come from cap or cabo ""cape"", or it may refer to a type of boat. Attempts to link the word to the Italian explorer Cabot are not supported by evidence.

In shipping
Cabotage laws apply to merchant ships in most countries that have a coastline so as to protect the domestic shipping industry from foreign competition, preserve domestically owned shipping infrastructure for national security purposes, and ensure safety in congested territorial waters.
For the history of cabotage in UK law, see Navigation Acts.
Indonesia implemented a cabotage policy in 2005 after previously allowing foreign-owned vessels to operate relatively freely within the country.
In the Philippines, the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 1937) which is also known as the Cabotage Law restricts coastwise trade or the transport of passengers and goods within the country, to vessels with Philippine registry which has to secure a coastwise licence from the Maritime Industry Authority. After the passage of Foreign Ships Co-Loading Act or the Republic Act No. 10668 in 2015, foreign vessels with cargo intended to be exported out of the country may dock in multiple ports in the country before transiting to a foreign port.
China does not permit foreign flagged vessels to conduct domestic transport or domestic transhipments without the prior approval of the Ministry of Transport. While Hong Kong and Macau maintain distinct internal cabotage regimes from the mainland, maritime cabotage between either territory and the mainland is considered domestic carriage and accordingly is off limits to foreign vessels. Similarly, maritime crossings across the Taiwan Strait requires special permits from both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China and are usually off-limits to foreign vessels.
In the EU, rights to cabotage in newly admitted member states (in particular, Greece, Spain and Portugal) were restricted; but this introductory provision was abandoned after criticism in the light of the Paros fe",politics
Cut and run,"Cut and run or cut-and-run is an idiomatic verb phrase meaning to ""make off promptly"" or to ""hurry off"". The phrase was in use by the 1700s to describe an act allowing a ship to make sail quickly in an urgent situation, by cutting free an anchor. Though initially referring to a literal act, the phrase was used figuratively by the mid-1800s in both the United States and England. The phrase is used pejoratively in political language, implying a panicked and cowardly retreat, and it has been used by politicians as a criticism of calls to withdraw troops from various armed conflicts, becoming particularly associated with the Iraq War and with the diction of the United States Republican Party. It has also been used in other contexts, such as in World War II military slang and to refer to a container shipping practice.

Origin
The phrase ""to cut and run"" was in use by the early 1700s, and Oxford English Dictionary cited the earliest printed usage of the phrase to The Boston News-Letter in 1704.
It was defined by Englishman David Steel in 1794 as ""to cut the cable and make sail instantly, without waiting to weigh anchor""; late 19th century nautical dictionaries provide the same definition. Steel further described the practice as ""quick but very expensive"" but sometimes necessary in urgent or emergency situations, such as when the anchor is hooked on rocks and cannot be retrieved, in bad weather, when the anchor is on lee shore and the ship is in danger of embayment, or when one must quickly escape or pursue an enemy. This practice was long in use by then, as it was described in 1623 by Henry Mainwaring in The Seaman's Dictionary: ""Cut the cable in the hawse; that is most commonly used when we ride in some storm and desire to set sail, but cannot stay the weighing of the anchor for fear of driving too much to leeward, or the like."" Instead of cutting the anchor by axe at the hawsehole, Steel offered an alternate method of slipping the anchor cable if time permitted, a method he felt wiser than cutting as it potentially prevented loss of anchor and cable.
An alternative origin was given by Peter Kemp in 1976 and Richard Mayne in 2000 in reference to cutting a painter rope to release a moored ship or, on square rig ships, cutting ropeyarns holding sails stopped to the yards to let them fall unfurled. Mayne felt this origin more plausible than a practice of cutting an anchor cable, given that anchors were expensive.

Figurative usage
Though ""cut and run"" initially referred to a literal act, it later came to be used figuratively. This usage was noted in The Sailor's Word-Book (1867) with the definition ""to move off quickly; to quit occupation; to be gone"". Oxford English Dictionary defines the figurative, colloquial usage as ""to make off promptly"" or to ""hurry off"". This usage initially conveyed a swift—though not necessarily panicked or disorganized—departure, and it appears in this sense in White-Jacket (1850) by American author Herman Melville, in Great E",politics

Manchester Triage System,"In medicine, triage (, ; French: [tʁiaʒ]) is a process by which care providers such as medical professionals and those with first aid knowledge determine the order of priority for providing treatment to injured individuals and/or inform the rationing of limited supplies so that they go to those who can most benefit from it. Triage is usually relied upon when there are more injured individuals than available care providers (known as a mass casualty incident), or when there are more injured individuals than supplies to treat them.

The methodologies of triage vary by institution, locality, and country but have the same universal underlying concepts. In most cases, the triage process places the most injured and most able to be helped as the first priority, with the most terminally injured the last priority (except in the case of reverse triage). Triage systems vary dramatically based on a variety of factors, and can follow specific, measurable metrics, like trauma scoring systems, or can be based on the medical opinion of the provider. Triage is an imperfect practice, and can be largely subjective, especially when based on general opinion rather than a score. This is because triage needs to balance multiple and sometimes contradictory objectives simultaneously, most of them being fundamental to personhood: likelihood of death, efficacy of treatment, patients' remaining lifespan, ethics, and religion.

Etymology and origin
The term triage comes directly from French triage, meaning the action of picking or sorting, it itself coming from the Old French verb trier, meaning to separate, sort, shift, or select; with trier in turn came from late Latin tritare, to grind. Although the concept existed much earlier, at least as far back as the reign of Maximillian I, it was not until the 1800s that the Old French trier was used to describe the practice of triage. That year, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey, the Surgeon in Chief of Napoleon's Imperial Guard laid the groundwork for what would eventually become modern triage introducing the concept of ""treat[ing] the wounded according to the observed gravity of their injuries and the urgency for medical care, regardless of their rank or nationality"".

Concepts in triage
Simple triage
Simple triage is usually used in a scene of an accident or ""mass-casualty incident"" (MCI), in order to sort patients into those who need critical attention and immediate transport to a secondary or tertiary care facility to survive, those who require low-intensity care to survive, those who are uninjured, and those who are deceased or will be so imminently. In the United States, this most commonly takes the form of the START triage model, in Canada, the CTAS model, and in Australia the ATS model. Assessment often begins with asking anyone who can walk to walk to a designated area, labeling them the lowest priority, and assessing other patients from there. Upon completion of the initial assessment by the care provider, which is based on th",medicine
Bankocracy,"Bankocracy (from the English word bank and Ancient Greek κράτος - kratos, ""power, rule"") or trapezocracy (from Greek τράπεζα - trapeza, ""bank"") is a polemic term referring to the excessive power or influence of banks on public policy-making. It can also refer to a form of government where financial institutions rule society.

Usage
One of the first uses of the term was by British Member of Parliament William Fullarton (1754–1808), who in a parliamentary debate on April 10, 1797 characterized the monopoly of the Bank of England as being a more important issue to solve than the peace attempts to end the war against France: It is Bankocracy that threatens the destruction of social order ... that turns and overturns all questions respecting war, negotiations, and peace.
United States Senator Robert J. Walker (1801–1869), a staunch opponent of the Bank of the United States, delivered a speech in the Senate on January 21, 1840, where he warned that the acceptance of paper money as legal tender would ""overthrow the Constitution, subvert the liberties of the country, and the rights of the people, and establish the reign of a bankocracy, more sordid, ruinous, and despotic, than that of any monarch, however absolute.""
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon used the term in his work Les Confessions d’un révolutionnaire (1849), in reference to the July Monarchy:

The principle of the July government, founded by and for the middle class, was therefore property, the capital. Under a monarchical form, the essence of that government was bankocracy.
Mikhail Bakunin, an anarchist like Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, used the term in his work Statism and Anarchy while talking about the reaction from the German State headed by Otto von Bismarck. He uses the russian term for Yid in the original script, a derogatory for the word ""Jew"", showing his historically noted anti-semitism.

This reaction is nothing other than the ultimate realization of the anti-popular idea of the modern state, the sole objective of which is to organize the most intensive exploitation of the people’s labor for the benefit of capital concentrated in a very small number of hands. It signifies the triumphant reign of the Yids, of a bankocracy under the powerful protection of a fiscal, bureaucratic, and police regime which relies mainly on military force and is therefore in essence despotic, but cloaks itself in the parliamentary game of pseudo-constitutionalism.
The term was also used by Karl Marx in his work Das Kapital, Kritik der politischen Ökonomie (1867). He theorizes the birth of national debt as the catalyst for the primitive accumulation of capital: The public debt becomes one of the most powerful levers of primitive accumulation. ... [T]he national debt has given rise to joint-stock companies, to dealings in negotiable effects of all kinds, and to agiotage, in a word to stock-exchange gambling and the modern bankocracy.
In Marxian economics, the term cognates with finance capitalism in general.

National memory,"National memory is a form of collective memory defined by shared experiences and culture. It is an integral part to national identity.
It represents one specific form of cultural memory, which makes an essential contribution to national group cohesion. Historically national communities have drawn upon commemorative ceremonies and monuments, myths and rituals, glorified individuals, objects, and events in their own history to produce a common narrative.
According to Lorraine Ryan, national memory is based on the public's reception of national historic narratives and the ability of people to affirm the legitimacy of these narratives.

Conflicting versions, dynamicity, manipulation and subjectivity
National memory typically consists of a shared interpretation of a nation's past. Such interpretations can vary and sometimes compete. They can get challenged and augmented by a range of interest groups, fighting to have their histories acknowledged, documented and commemorated and reshape national stories. Often national memory is adjusted to offer a politicized vision of the past to make a political position appear consistent with national identity. Furthermore, it profoundly affects how historical facts are perceived and recorded and may circumvent or appropriate facts. A repertoire of discursive strategies functions to emotionalize national narrative and nationalize personal pasts.
National memory has been used calculatedly by governments for dynastic, political, religious and cultural purposes since as early as the sixteenth century.
Marketing of memory by the culture industry and its instrumentalisation for political purposes can both be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.
Lorraine Ryan notes that individual memory both shapes and is shaped by national memory, and that there is a competition between the dominant and individual memories of a nation.
Hyung Park states that the nation is continuously revived, re-imagined, reconstituted, through shared memories among its citizens.
National memories may also conflict with the other nations' collective memory.

Role of the media
Reports that are narrated in terms of national memory characterize the past in ways that merge the past, the present and the future into ""a single ongoing tale"".
Pierre Nora argues that a ""democratisation of history"" allows for emancipatory versions of the past to surface:

National memory cannot come into being until the historical framework of the nation has been shattered. It reflects the abandonment of the traditional channels and modes of transmission of the past and the desacralisation of such primary sites of initiation as the school, the family, the museum, and the monument: what was once the responsibility of these institutions has now flowed over into the public domain and been taken over by the media and tourist industry
However, national history being passed on by the culture industry, such as by historical films, can be seen as s",history
Prati criteria,"The Prati criteria are a revision to the clinical definition of normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) which was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2002. Daniele Prati and colleagues identified that, in the original research which developed guidelines for normal ranges of ALT, the cohort included subjects with subclinical disease such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This led to ranges of 40 U/L in men and 30 U/L in women. This marker had low sensitivity and high specificity due to classification of individuals with subclinical disease counted as healthy controls. Revised model criteria led to a healthy range of 19 U/L in women and 30 U/L in men. This led to a 21.3% increase in sensitivity for an 8.9% decrease in specificity.

Health survival paradox,"The male-female health survival paradox, also known as the morbidity-mortality paradox or gender paradox, is the phenomenon in which female humans experience more medical conditions and disability during their lives, but live longer than males.  The observation that females experience greater morbidity (diseases) but lower mortality (death) in comparison to males is paradoxical since it is expected that experiencing disease increases the likelihood of death. However, in this case, the part of the population that experiences more disease and disability is the one that lives longer.

Background and history
The male-female health survival paradox has been most reliably reported in literature and documented as far back as the 18th century in European historical records. Some of the last records of European men outliving women are from the Netherlands in 1860 and Italy in 1889. The earliest records of European women outliving men were from Sweden in 1751, Denmark in 1835, and both England and Wales in 1841. While women were documented to outlive men in Europe, data from 1887 through 1930 showed that females between ages 5 and 25 in Massachusetts disproportionately faced mortality due to infectious diseases. With improvements in infectious disease prevention, treatment, and eradication of Smallpox around the 1970s, mortality rates declined in both sexes. At this time, female life expectancy also peaked in the United States; females were expected to live eight years longer than males. Since the 1970s, the life expectancy gap between females and males has been on the decline in the United States and Western Europe.
Although more research needs to be completed, it is postulated that there is a ""biopsychosocial"" component which causes this paradox. In other words, women and men differ in biological, behavioral, and social factors which causes the male-female health survival paradox.
Biopsychosocial factors that have been hypothesized to cause this paradox include genetics, hormone differences, immunological differences, reproduction, chronic diseases, disability, physiological reserve, risk-related activities, illness perception, health reporting behavior, health care utilization, gender roles, and social assets and deficits.
Scholars relate the male-female health survival paradox to the concept of frailty, which is the vulnerability that the aging population has to adverse health outcomes. Such geriatric propensity to frailty is an emerging topic of research given new therapeutic interventions aimed at improving the health of the aging population, such as healthy nutrition, physical exercise, cognitive training, and multimodal interventions that encompass all of these components.

Common Agricultural Policy,"The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the agricultural policy of the European Commission. It implements a system of agricultural subsidies and other programmes. It was introduced in 1962 and has since then undergone several changes to reduce the EEC budget cost (from 73% in 1985, to 37% in 2017) and consider rural development in its aims. It has however, been criticised on the grounds of its cost, its environmental, and humanitarian effects.

Overview
The CAP is often explained as the result of a political compromise between France and Germany: German industry would have access to the French market; in exchange, Germany would help pay for France's farmers. The CAP has always been a difficult area of EU policy to reform; it is a problem that began in the 1960s and one that has continued to the present, albeit less severely. Changes to the CAP are proposed by the European Commission, after a public consultation, which then sends its proposals to the Council and to the European Parliament. Both the Council and the European Parliament have to agree to any changes. The Parliament was involved in the process of change for the first time in 2013. The involvement of the Parliament, which represents the citizens, increases the democratic legitimacy of the CAP. Outside Brussels proper, the impact of the powerful farming lobby has been a factor in determining EU agricultural policy since the earliest days of integration.
In recent times change has been more forthcoming because of external trade demands and intrusion in agricultural affairs by other parts of the EU policy framework, such as consumer advocate working groups and the environmental departments of the Union. In addition, Euroscepticism in states such as Denmark (and formerly the UK) is fed in part by the CAP, which Eurosceptics consider detrimental to their economies.
Proponents claim that the CAP is an exceptional economic sector as it protects the ""rural way of life"" although it is recognized that it affects world poverty.
The policy has evolved significantly since it was created by the Treaty of Rome (1957). Substantial reforms over the years have moved the CAP away from a production-oriented policy.
CAP has been divided into two 'pillars':

Agricultural production support and common organization of markets (I pillar, known otherwise earlier as the 'agricultural guarantee' section)
Rural development policy (II pillar, otherwise the 'agricultural structural policy' pillar, known earlier as the 'agricultural guidance' section).
Accordingly, the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) of the EU, which initially used to fund the CAP as a whole, has been replaced in 2007 with two separate funds, one for each of the two pillars:

the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and
the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD, a structural fund).
CAP reforms have steadily lowered its share in the EU budget: in 1980 it accounted for more than 70% of the EU expenditur",economics
Damaging quotation,"A damaging quotation is a short utterance by a public figure used by opponents as a discrediting tactic. These quotations may be inserted or alluded to in negative political ads to discredit the character or intellectual ability of the originator. More typically, however, they are used in political arguments by both politicians and political pundits often in ways which are fallacious. These quotations are compiled into books or posted on the internet and are repeated in other contexts such as in talk radio or in the United States by stand-up comedians in late-night television monologues. The publication of these quotations is justified as a necessary part of maintaining an informed citizenry. In cases where the quotation in question is taken widely out of context it can be difficult for a candidate to find recourse, even though it is very easy to check the accuracy and the context of a quotation by using internet resources (such as search engines); in popular jargon, the quotation (especially if humorous) can grow into a meme.

Categories
There are various common categories of quotations: malapropisms or grammatical errors, exaggerations about past achievements, lack of conviction, consorting with the enemy, moral turpitude, indifference towards victims of crime, racist or discriminatory, etc. 
In the case of malapropisms, it is a rhetorical fallacy (called argument ad hominem) to conclude that the entire argument of whoever made the utterance is incorrect. Yet it has become common in partisan argument in the United States. For instance: former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, during an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN (March 9, 1999) stated, ""During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system."" This has frequently been distorted by opponents to say that Gore claimed, ""I invented the Internet."" Partisans have so often used this distorted quotation to discredit him that Internet pioneer Vint Cerf (and others who participated in actually inventing the Internet) have made a point of noting Gore's support and the error of the discreditors.
With the availability of inexpensive computers and the widespread use of the Internet, it has become easy for anyone to accumulate and distribute these quotation lists. Like the ""Yogiisms"" of baseball great Yogi Berra, or the Colemanballs collected by Private Eye, a damaging quotation purports to give insight into the thinking of the speaker, frequently a politician or of the politicians or political groups that used it as means of attack. As such they belong to the colorful history of political satire.

Formal science,"Formal science is a branch of science studying disciplines concerned with abstract structures described by formal systems, such as logic, mathematics, statistics, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, information theory, game theory, systems theory, decision theory and theoretical linguistics. Whereas the natural sciences and social sciences seek to characterize physical systems and social systems, respectively, using empirical methods, the formal sciences use language tools concerned with characterizing abstract structures described by formal systems. The formal sciences aid the natural and social sciences by providing information about the structures used to describe the physical world, and what inferences may be made about them.

Differences from other sciences
One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.
Because of their non-empirical nature, formal sciences are construed by outlining a set of axioms and definitions from which other statements (theorems) are deduced. For this reason, in Rudolf Carnap's logical-positivist conception of the epistemology of science, theories belonging to formal sciences are understood to contain no synthetic statements, instead containing only analytic statements.

Individual ministerial responsibility,"In Westminster-style governments, individual ministerial responsibility is a constitutional convention that a cabinet minister bears the ultimate responsibility for the actions of their ministry or department. Individual ministerial responsibility is not the same as cabinet collective responsibility, which states members of the cabinet must approve publicly of its collective decisions or resign. This means that a Parliamentary motion for a vote of no confidence is not in order should the actions of an organ of government fail in the proper discharge of its responsibilities. Where there is ministerial responsibility, the accountable minister is expected to take the blame and ultimately resign, but the majority or coalition within parliament of which the minister is part, is not held to be answerable for that minister's failure.
This means that if waste, corruption, or any other misbehaviour is found to have occurred within a ministry, the minister is responsible even if the minister had no knowledge of the actions. A minister is ultimately responsible for all actions by a ministry because, even without knowledge of an infraction by subordinates, the minister approved the hiring and continued employment of those civil servants. If misdeeds are found to have occurred in a ministry, the minister is expected to resign. It is also possible for a minister to face criminal charges for malfeasance under their watch.
The principle is considered essential, as it is seen to guarantee that an elected official is answerable for every single government decision. It is also important to motivate ministers to closely scrutinize the activities within their departments. One rule coming from this principle is that each cabinet member answers for their own ministry in parliament's question time. The reverse of ministerial responsibility is that civil servants are not supposed to take credit for the successes of their department, allowing the government to claim them.
In recent years some commentators have argued the notion of ministerial responsibility has been eroded in many Commonwealth countries. As the doctrine is a constitutional convention, there is no formal mechanism for enforcing the rule. Today ministers frequently use ignorance of misbehaviour as an argument for lack of culpability, or argue that actions were instigated by a previous minister, or even a previous government. While opposition parties rarely accept this argument, the electorate is often more accepting. In most other Commonwealth countries such cases are today hardly ever brought to trial.

Australia
The doctrine of ministerial responsibility in the Australian Government was inherited in its adoption of the Westminster system. Commonwealth ministers are obliged to report failings of departments under their control to the Parliament, and to actively seek solutions to problems in their jurisdiction. A minister who fails to properly do either of these is expected to resign.

Five-pin bowling,"Five-pin bowling is a bowling variant which is played in Canada, where many bowling alleys offer it, either alone or in combination with ten-pin bowling. It was devised around 1909 by Thomas F. Ryan in Toronto, Ontario, at his Toronto Bowling Club, in response to customers who complained that the ten-pin game was too strenuous. He cut five tenpins down to about 75% of their size, and used hand-sized hard rubber balls, thus inventing the original version of five-pin bowling.

Gameplay
The balls in five pin bowling are small enough to fit in the hand and therefore typically have no fingerholes, although the Canadian 5 Pin Bowlers Association (C5PBA) has approved balls with thumb holes.: 20 
At the end of the lane there are five pins arranged in a V. They are midway in size between duckpins and ten pins, and they have a heavy rubber band around their middles to make them move farther when struck. 
Unlike any other form of bowling popular in North America, the pins in five-pin bowling are worth different scoring point values, depending on their location in the V-formation. The centre pin is worth five points if knocked down, those on either side, three each, and the outermost pins, two each, giving a total of 15 in each frame.
In each frame, each player gets three attempts to knock all five pins over. Knocking all five pins down with the first ball is a strike, worth 15 points, plus the score achieved by the player's first two balls of the next frame are added to the score for the strike; the count in the frame where the first strike was bowled is left blank until the bowler makes their first delivery of the next frame. As those points are also counted in their own frame, in effect they count double. A player who takes two balls to knock all the pins down gets a spare, which means the first ball of the next frame counts double. When a bowler bowls two strikes in succession, within a game, the bowler has scored a ""double"". When a double has been bowled, the count for the first strike is 30 points plus the value of the pins bowled down with the first ball of the frame following the second strike. When a bowler bowls three strikes in succession, within a game, the bowler has scored a ""triple"" (also called a ""turkey""). In scoring three successive strikes, the bowler is credited with 45 points in the frame where the first strike was bowled. As in ten-pin, if either of these happen in the last frame, the player gets to take one or two shots at a re-racked set of pins immediately.

A perfect score is 450, requiring 12 consecutive strikes bowled in the same game without fouling. It does not happen as frequently as in tenpin bowling. The C5PBA sanctions from 15 to 30 perfect games annually.

Originally the pins counted as (from left to right) 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 5 points. In 1952 the president of the Canadian Bowling Association proposed changing the scoring system to 2 - 3 - 5 - 3 - 2. That was accepted in the west in 1952, in Ontario in 1953, and in the rest of",sports
Long Peace,"The ""Long Peace"" is a term for the unprecedented historical period of relative global stability following the end of World War II in 1945 to the present day. The period of the Cold War (1947–1991) was marked by the absence of major wars between the superpowers of the period, the United States and the Soviet Union. John Lewis Gaddis first used the term in 1986, stressing that the period of ""relative peace"" has twice outlasted the interwar period by now. The Cold War, with all its rivalries, anxieties and unquestionable dangers, has produced the longest period of stability in relations among the great powers that the world has known in the 20th century; it now compares favorably as well with some of the longest periods of great-power stability in all of modern history. The Long Peace has been compared to the relatively-long stability of the Roman Empire, the Pax Romana, or the Pax Britannica, a century of relative peace that existed between the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, during which the British Empire held global hegemony. Since Pax Britannica was interrupted by major power wars and Pax Romana was not on the global scale, some scholars find us living in the most peaceful period of modern time, or even ""in the most peaceful era in our species' existence.""

Decline of war
Coining the term Long Peace in 1986, Gaddis warned: One should be exceedingly wary of predicting how long the current era of Soviet-American stability will last. It lasted five more years. Then the Cold War ended causing what the US strategists called ""peace shock.""
The following Defense Planning Guidance expressed a relief: we no longer will focus on the threat of a short-warning Soviet-led, European-wide conflict leading quickly to global war and, perhaps, escalating just as quickly to nuclear war.
The world appeared pacified with no mighty Eurasian state or bloc targeting its strategic forces on the West and no great-power war looming in Eurasia.
In 1991, the ""Doomsday Clock"" of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists retreated to 17 minutes to midnight, the furthest from midnight the clock has been since its inception and expressing a huge time span for the Bulletin. The same year, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, expressed his problem: ""I'm running out of demons. I'm running out of enemies. I'm down to Castro and Kim II Sung.""
Initially, it was thought that the Long Peace was a unique result of the Cold War. However, in the post-Cold War period the same trends continued and strengthened. In 2005, Gaddis concluded that major wars fought between major states had become an anachronism. The post-Cold War peace become called the ""New Peace."" Wars between leading powers and preparations for such wars have been the driving motor of international politics for centuries. ""At the risk of hyperbole,"" Robert Jervis suggests that turning off this motor is the greatest change in international politics seen in history by 2",history
Beach soccer,"Beach soccer, also known as beach football, sand football or beasal (a portmanteau of ""beach"" and ""futsal""), is a variant of association football played on a beach or some form of sand.
Football has long been played informally on beaches, but the introduction of beach soccer was an attempt to codify rules for the game in 1992 by the founders of Beach Soccer Worldwide, a company set up to develop the sport and responsible for the majority of its tournaments.
The first international matches were played in 1993 for men and 2009 for women. As of July 2023, there are 193 men's and 64 women's clubs and 101 men's and 23 women's national teams sorted in the Beach Soccer Worldwide Rankings.

History
Beach football (beasal or futebol de areia) started in Brazil, more precisely at Rio de Janeiro. In 1950 the first official tournament was created to unite neighborhood small tournaments that happened since 1940. It has grown to be an international game. The participation of international players such as Eric Cantona, Michel, Julio Salinas, Romário, Júnior and Zico has helped to expand television coverage to audiences in over 170 countries.
Beach soccer had been played recreationally for years and in different formats. In 1992 the laws of the game were envisioned and a pilot event was staged by the founding partners of BSWW in Los Angeles and the sport was adopted by Beach Soccer Los Angeles in 2017 where the game is played all around Los Angeles County. By 1993, the first professional beach soccer competition was organized at Miami Beach with teams from the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Italy taking part.

In April 1994 the first event to be covered by network television transmissions was held on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro and the city hosted the first Beach Soccer World Championship in 1995. The competition was won by the host nation, making Brazil the first-ever World Champions of Beach Soccer. Commercial interest begin to match developments on the field and growing demand for the sport around the world gave rise to the Pro Beach Soccer Tour in 1996.
The first Pro Beach Soccer Tour included a total of 60 games in two years across South America, Europe, Asia and the United States. Interest generated by the tour in Europe led to the creation of the European Pro Beach Soccer League in 1998, providing a more solid infrastructure that would increase the professionalism of the spectacle. EPBSL, now known as the Euro BS League, brought promoters together from across the continent and satisfied the demands of the media, sponsors and fans. Four years on from its creation, the first step in the building of a legitimate worldwide competition structure for the sport of pro beach soccer had been taken.
Behind the scenes developments were also taking place, with the Beach Soccer Company relocating its headquarters to Europe firstly to Monaco and then Barcelona before becoming Pro Beach Soccer, S.L. in April 2000. One year later they would join forces with ",sports
Family farm,"A family farm is generally understood to be a farm owned and/or operated by a family. It is sometimes considered to be an estate passed down by inheritance.
Although a recurring conceptual and archetypal distinction is that of a family farm as a smallholding versus corporate farming as large-scale agribusiness, that notion does not accurately describe the realities of farm ownership in many countries. Family farm businesses can take many forms, from smallholder farms to larger farms operated under intensive farming practices. In various countries, most farm families have structured their farm businesses as corporations (such as limited liability companies) or trusts, for liability, tax, and business purposes. Thus, the idea of a family farm as a unitary concept or definition does not easily translate across languages, cultures, or centuries, as there are substantial differences in agricultural traditions and histories between countries and between centuries within a country. For example, in U.S. agriculture, a family farm can be of any size, as long as the ownership is held within a family. A 2014 USDA report shows that family farms operate 90 percent of the nation's farmland, and account for 85 percent of the country's agricultural production value. However, that does not at all imply that corporate farming is a small presence in U.S. agriculture; rather, it simply reflects the fact that many corporations are closely held. In contrast, in Brazilian agriculture, the official definition of a family farm (agricultura familiar) is limited to small farms worked primarily by members of a single family; but again, this fact does not imply that corporate farming is a small presence in Brazilian agriculture; rather, it simply reflects the fact that large farms with many workers cannot be legally classified under the family farm label because that label is legally reserved for smallholdings in that country.
Farms that would not be considered family farms would be those operated as collectives, non-family corporations, or in other institutionalised forms. At least 500 million of the world's [estimated] 570 million farms are managed by families, making family farms predominant in global agriculture.

Definitions
An ""informal discussion of the concepts and definitions"" in a working paper published by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2014 reviewed English, Spanish and French definitions of the concept of ""family farm"". 
Definitions referred to one or more of labor, management, size, provision of family livelihood, residence, family ties and generational aspects, community and social networks, subsistence orientation, patrimony, land ownership and family investment. The disparity of definitions reflects national and geographical differences in cultures, rural land tenure, and rural economies, as well as the different purposes for which definitions are coined.
The 2012 United States Census of Agriculture defines a family farm as ""any f",economics
Paedology,"Paedology (also spelled pedology or paidology) is the study of children's behavior and development. It may be considered distinct from pedagogy, the art or science of teaching, and pediatrics, the field of medicine relating to children. However, pedology is not commonly recognized as a distinct field of study; therefore, many people who would be described as pedologists are instead described as pedagogues, pediatricians, psychologists, etc. Another factor that contributes to paedology's lack of recognition as a distinct field of study is because one could make contributions to the field of pedology while also making contributions to other fields. For example, Jean Piaget made contributions to the study of pedology in his theories of the cognitive development of children; however, Piaget has more commonly been recognized as a developmental psychologist.

Origins of paedology
The origins of this trend in psychology and pedagogy go back to the end of the 18th century with the separation of a branch of psychology that would form the basis of pedagogy, a pedagogic psychology or ""experimental pedagogic psychology"", ""experimental pedagogy"", ""experimental education"".
G. Stanley Hall (1844–1924) fostered pedology as a separate study, and also became instrumental in the development of modern educational psychology.  An American researcher, Oscar Chrisman, proposed the term ""pedology"" in 1893. At the end of the 19th century, pedology as a comprehensive study of the child came to prominence in Europe as an attempt to create a study of children in the manner of natural sciences. In 1909 Professor Kazimierz Twardowski organized a Pedological Society in Lviv, Austro-Hungary (now Ukraine). In 1910 a similar society was organized in Kraków. In 1911 the first World Congress in Pedology took place in Brussels, Belgium, with attendants from 22 countries.
World War I (1914–1918) effectively put an end to the development of this study in Western Europe.
Since pedology as a branch of science never reached its maturity, there is no common established understanding as to the scope or instruments of pedology.
Bowie State University in Bowie, Maryland became the first university in the United States to offer a bachelor's degree in pedology. A 2014 document from the university refers to ""the pedology major (now known as child and adolescent studies)"". At many universities in the United States, pedological study is generally classified under the major ""child development.""

Pedology in the Soviet Union
In Russian Empire a prominent developer of the field was Aleksandr Petrovich Nechayev in St. Petersburg, who in 1901 created the laboratory of experimental pedagogical psychology. Soviet pedology is traditionally thought to be founded by the efforts of Vladimir Bekhterev; in particular, in 1918 he founded the Institute of Pedology as part of psychological institutions united into the Institute for Study of Brain and Psychical Activity.
This science was intensively pursued in 19",science
Disc golf,"Disc golf, also known as frisbee golf, is a flying disc sport in which players throw a disc at a target, using rules similar to golf.
The sport is usually played on a course with 9 or 18 holes, each consisting of a teeing area and target (basket). Players complete a hole by throwing a disc from a tee pad or tee area toward a basket, throwing again from where the previous throw came to rest, until the disc comes to rest in the designated basket. Disc golf targets are composed of a metal basket supported by a center pole, with chains hanging from an upper band. They are designed to catch the incoming discs, which then fall into the basket.
Usually, the number of throws a player uses to reach each basket is tallied (most often in relation to par), and players seek to complete each hole in the lowest number of total throws. Par is considered to be the number of strokes a skilled player is expected to make for a given hole or a group of holes (usually 9 or 18).
The game is played in about 40 countries, and as of 2023, there are 107,853 active members of the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) worldwide. According to the UDisc course directory, there are over 15,000 disc golf courses, with roughly 90% being accessible for free.

Origin and early history
Modern disc golf started in the early 1960s, but there is debate over who came up with the idea first. The consensus is that multiple groups of people played independently throughout the 1960s. Students at Rice University in Houston, Texas, for example, held tournaments with trees as targets as early as 1964, and in the early 1960s, players in Pendleton King Park in Augusta, Georgia, would toss Frisbees into 50-gallon barrel trash cans designated as targets. In 1968 Frisbee Golf was also played in Alameda Park in Santa Barbara, California, by teenagers in the Anacapa and Sola street areas. Gazebos, water fountains, lamp posts, and trees were all part of the course. This took place for several years and an Alameda Park collectors edition disc still exists, though rare, as few were made. Clifford Towne from this group went on to hold a National Time Aloft record.

1970s
Ed Headrick, also known as ""Steady"" Ed Headrick, (June 28, 1924 – August 12, 2002) was an American toy inventor. He is most well known as the father of both the modern-day Frisbee and of the sport and game of disc golf.
In 1975, Headrick's tenure at Wham-O where he helped redesign the flying disc known as the frisbee ended, and ties between Headrick and Wham-O eventually split. Headrick left the company to start out on his own to focus all his efforts on his new interest, which he coined and trademarked ""Disc Golf"".
In 1976, ""Steady"" Ed Headrick and his son Ken Headrick started the first disc golf company, the Disc Golf Association (DGA). The purpose of DGA was to manufacture discs and baskets and to formalize the sport. The first disc golf target was Ed's pole hole design which consisted of a pole sticking out of the ground.

Social neuroscience,"Social neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding the relationship between social experiences and biological systems. Humans are fundamentally a social species, and studies indicate that various social influences, including life events, poverty, unemployment and loneliness can influence health related biomarkers. Still a young field, social neuroscience is closely related to personality neuroscience, affective neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience, focusing on how the brain mediates social interactions. The biological underpinnings of social cognition are investigated in social cognitive neuroscience.
The term ""social neuroscience"" can be traced to a publication entitled ""Social Neuroscience Bulletin"" which was published quarterly between 1988 and 1994. The term was subsequently popularized in an article by John Cacioppo and Gary Berntson, published in the American Psychologist in 1992. Cacioppo and Berntson are considered as the legitimate fathers of social neuroscience.

Overview
Traditional neuroscience has for many years considered the nervous system as an isolated entity and largely ignored influences of the social environments in which humans and many animal species live. In fact, we now recognize the considerable impact of social structures on the operations of the brain and body. These social factors operate on the individual through a continuous interplay of neural, neuroendocrine, metabolic and immune factors on brain and body, in which the brain is the central regulatory organ and also a malleable target of these factors. Social neuroscience investigates the biological mechanisms that underlie social processes and behavior, widely considered one of the major problem areas for the neurosciences in the 21st century, and applies concepts and methods of biology to develop theories of social processes and behavior in the social and behavioral sciences. Social neuroscience capitalizes on biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior, and it uses social and behavioral constructs and data to advance theories of neural organization and function.
Throughout most of the 20th century, social and biological explanations were widely viewed as incompatible. But advances in recent years have led to the development of a new approach synthesized from the social and biological sciences. The new field of social neuroscience emphasizes the complementary relationship between the different levels of organization, spanning the social and biological domains (e.g., molecular, cellular, system, person, relational, collective, societal) and the use of multi-level analyses to foster understanding of the mechanisms underlying the human mind and behavior.
Contemporary insights into the origins of social interactions raise interest in hyperscanning or interbrain research. Studying the correlation of neuronal activities of two or more brains in shared cognitive tasks can contribute to understanding the rela",science
Artes mechanicae,"Artes mechanicae (mechanical arts) are a medieval concept of ordered practices or skills, often juxtaposed to the traditional seven liberal arts (artes liberales). Also called ""servile"" and ""vulgar"", from antiquity they had been deemed ""unbecoming"" for a free man, as they minister to basic needs.

Overview
Johannes Scotus Eriugena (9th century) divided them into seven parts: 

vestiaria (tailoring, weaving)
agricultura (agriculture)
architectura (architecture, masonry)
militia and venatoria (warfare and hunting, military education, ""martial arts"")
mercatura (trade)
coquinaria (cooking)
metallaria (blacksmithing, metallurgy)
In his Didascalicon, Hugh of St Victor (12th century) includes navigation, medicine and theatrical arts instead of commerce, agriculture and cooking. Hugh's treatment somewhat elevates the mechanical arts as ordained to the improvement of humanity, a promotion which was to represent a growing trend among late medievals.
The classification of the artes mechanicae as applied geometry was introduced to Western Europe by Dominicus Gundissalinus (12th century) under the influence of his readings in Arabic scholarship.
In the 19th century, ""mechanic arts"" referred to some of the  fields that are now known as engineering.  Use of the term was apparently an attempt to distinguish these fields from creative and artistic endeavors like the performing arts and the fine arts, which were for the upper class of the time, and the intelligentsia.  The mechanic arts were also considered practical fields for those that did not come from good families.
Related phrases, ""useful arts"" or ""applied arts"" probably encompass the mechanic arts as well as craftsmanship in general.
In the United States, the most famous usage of the term ""mechanic arts"" (and the one in which it is most commonly encountered today) is in the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act.

History of aviation,"The history of aviation spans over two millennia, from the earliest innovations like kites and attempts at tower jumping to supersonic and hypersonic flight in powered, heavier-than-air jet aircraft. Kite flying in China, dating back several hundred years BC, is considered the earliest example of man-made flight. In the 15th-century Leonardo da Vinci created several flying machine designs incorporating aeronautical concepts, but they were unworkable due to the limitations of contemporary knowledge.
In the late 18th century, the Montgolfier brothers invented the hot-air balloon which soon led to manned flights. At almost the same time, the discovery of hydrogen gas led to the invention of the hydrogen balloon. Various theories in mechanics by physicists during the same period, such as fluid dynamics and Newton's laws of motion, led to the development of modern aerodynamics; most notably by Sir George Cayley. Balloons, both free-flying and tethered, began to be used for military purposes from the end of the 18th century, with France establishing balloon companies during the French Revolution.
In the 19th century, especially the second half, experiments with gliders provided the basis for learning the dynamics of winged aircraft; most notably by Cayley, Otto Lilienthal, and Octave Chanute. By the early 20th century, advances in engine technology and aerodynamics made controlled, powered, manned heavier-than-air flight possible for the first time. In 1903, following their pioneering research and experiments with wing design and aircraft control, the Wright brothers successfully incorporated all of the required elements to create and fly the first aeroplane. The basic configuration with its characteristic cruciform tail was established by 1909, followed by rapid design and performance improvements aided by the development of more powerful engines.
The first vessels of the air were the rigid steerable balloons pioneered by Ferdinand von Zeppelin that became synonymous with airships and dominated long-distance flight until the 1930s, when large flying boats became popular for trans-oceanic routes. After World War II, the flying boats were in turn replaced by airplanes operating from land, made far more capable first by improved propeller engines, then by jet engines, which revolutionized both civilian air travel and military aviation.
In the latter half of the 20th century, the development of digital electronics led to major advances in flight instrumentation and ""fly-by-wire"" systems. The 21st century has seen the widespread use of pilotless drones for military, commercial, and recreational purposes. With computerized controls, inherently unstable aircraft designs, such as flying wings, have also become practical.

Etymology
The term aviation, is a noun of action from the stem of Latin avis ""bird"" with the suffix -ation meaning action or progress. It was coined in 1863 by French pioneer Guillaume Joseph Gabriel de La Landelle (1812–1886) in Aviation ou",science
Balkanization,"Balkanization or Balkanisation is the process involving the fragmentation of an area, country, or region into multiple smaller and hostile units. It is usually caused by differences in ethnicity, culture, religion, and geopolitical interests.
The term was first coined in the early 20th century, and found its roots in the depiction of events during the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918), specifically referring to incidents that transpired earlier in the Balkan Peninsula.
The term is pejorative; when sponsored or encouraged by a sovereign third party, it has been used as an accusation against such third-party nations. Controversially, the term is often used by opponents of  secessionism to highlight potential dangers. The Balkan peninsula is seen as an example of shatter belts in geopolitics.

Origins of the term
Coined in the early 20th century, the term ""Balkanization"" traces its origins to the depiction of events during the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and the First World War (1914–1918). It did not emerge during the gradual secession of Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire over the 19th century, but was coined at the end of the First World War. Albania was the only addition to the existing Balkan map at that time, as other nations had already formed in the nineteenth century. The term was initially employed by journalists and politicians, who used it as a conceptual tool to interpret the evolving global order resulting from the collapse of the Habsburg and Romanov Empires and the subsequent secession of Balkan nations following the Ottoman Empire's disintegration in the nineteenth century. After the Second World War (1939–1945), the term underwent significant development, expanding beyond its original context to encompass diverse fields such as linguistics, demography, information technology, gastronomy, and more. This expansion extended its descriptive reach to various phenomena, often with pejorative connotations. In response, critical scholars in the late 20th and early 21st centuries sought to denaturalize and reclaim 'balkanization'.

Nations and societies
The term (coined in the early 20th century in the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire) refers to the division of the Balkan peninsula, which was ruled almost entirely by the Ottoman Empire, into a number of smaller states between 1817 and 1912. It came into common use in the immediate aftermath of the First World War, with reference to the many new states that arose from the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire.

Uses to stir opinion
Countries in Europe, where uniting quite recently historically distinct peoples or nations, have seen outspoken separatists. These have prompted reactionary voices fearing Balkanization. The Iberian Peninsula, especially Spain, has from the time of Al-Andalus (ending in 1492) seen voices fearing disorderly rupture. Its main separatist movements today are Basque separatism and Catalan independentism.

Community wealth building,"Community wealth building is a term which covers a range of approaches which ""...aim at improving the ability of communities and individuals to increase asset ownership, anchor jobs locally by broadening ownership over capital, help achieve key environmental goals, expand the provision of public services and ensure local economic stability”. The original model, the Cleveland Model, was developed in Cleveland, United States, however the Cleveland Model has also been developed and applied with the creation of the ""Preston Model"", in Preston, Lancashire. It is a form of municipal socialism which utilises ""anchor institutions"", living wage expansion, community banking, public pension investment, worker ownership and municipal enterprise tied to a procurement strategy at the municipal level.

Preston Model
The Preston Model is an approach to community wealth building pioneered by Preston City Council, Lancashire, England, and its partners, including Lancashire County Council, Lancashire Constabulary, the University of Central Lancashire, local colleges and a local housing provider. The model is a form of municipal socialism which utilises ""anchor institutions"", living wage expansion, community banking, public pension investment, worker ownership and municipal enterprise tied to a procurement strategy at the municipal level. Anchor institutions are mission-driven organisations committed to maintaining service in their local communities, such as councils, hospitals, universities, colleges and housing associations.
It is based on projects developed in Cleveland, Ohio and Mondragon, Spain. Councillor Matthew Brown, originally Executive Member for Social Justice, Inclusion and Policy, played a key role in developing the model with his colleague Councillor Martyn Rawlinson, working in conjunction with the Centre for Local Economic Strategies. The first issue they tackled in 2012-2013 was to localise their procurement spend in Preston and the surrounding county of Lancashire. Former Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell was a vocal supporter of the project during his time on the frontbenches.

Criticism
The plan has been criticised by some members of Preston City Council. The leader of the council's Liberal Democrat group described it as a 'marketing gimmick' that has not had a substantial effect on the local area, and that locals are not interested in the project. Critics have also pointed out Preston relies heavily on multi-national companies for employment, and that local procurement isn't the answer to everything, despite being a useful tool.

Other areas
Preston City Council notes that its model builds on Manchester City Council's ""principles of progressive procurement"" and mentions Birmingham, Oldham, Salford, Kirklees, Islington, Enfield, Southampton, Wakefield and Bristol as examples of other UK locations implementing similar community wealth building approaches.

History of Canadian sports,"The history of Canadian sports falls into five stages of development: early recreational activities before 1840; the start of organized competition, 1840–1880; the emergence of national organizations, 1882–1914; the rapid growth of both amateur and professional sports, 1914 to 1960; and developments of the last half-century.  Some sports, especially ice hockey, lacrosse, curling, and ringette enjoy an international reputation as particularly Canadian. Although typically thought of as American, the origin of the sport of baseball began the Canadian town of Beachville, Ontario, and American football was initially developed by Canadians at McGill University before two different playing styles emerged, American football and Canadian football. Canadian sports attract large numbers of participants and huge audiences; hockey has become part of the national identity.
Women actively compete in most of these sports. Historically, team sports often involved informal gambling and more formal, bigger-stakes wagering and prize competitions were particularly characteristic in the sports of horse racing and boxing. In Canada, individual sports such as figure skating, skiing, golf, paddling, swimming, and track and field have long been important. In recent years, there has been an increase in the popularity of more ""extreme"" sports such as snowboarding, rollerblading, and mountain climbing.
In many modern nations including Canada, sports have faced a number of challenges in recent decades such as violence, racism, illegal drug therapies, ridicule of women, the disproportionally high salaries of professional athletes, and the exorbitant costs of newly built stadiums. Such problems stand in contrast to the fundamental values of sports including personal health, teamwork, striving for responsibility, loyalty, equality, winning, pleasure, and freedom.

Origins
Immigrants brought along their favourite sports, often adapting them to the snowy environment.  The influence of the games of the First Nations can be seen especially in the evolution of lacrosse.  British officers, soldiers, and royal officials, and indeed ordinary British immigrants as well, transplanted such games as football, rugby, curling, and cricket; sailors brought rowing competitions. Britons considered these sports to be conducive to relieving boredom on remote outposts, and more generally produced team spirit, good health, hardiness, and manliness; they were a sophisticated alternative to ""blood sports"", such as cockfighting, bullfighting or bear baiting.

First Nations
Paraschak, identifies two approaches to the history of Native American sports. On the one hand, there is the history of First Nation athletes playing within the Euro-American mainstream culture. Important topics include the issues of racism, exploitation, and ethnocentric distortion. Secondly there is the history of the sports played among the natives, especially the history of lacrosse as well as other games.  The different tribes p",sports
Chinese martial arts,"Chinese martial arts, commonly referred to with umbrella terms kung fu (; Chinese: 功夫; pinyin: gōngfu; Cantonese Yale: gūng fū), kuoshu (國術; guóshù) or wushu (武術; wǔshù), are multiple fighting styles that have developed over the centuries in Greater China. These fighting styles are often classified according to common traits, identified as ""families"" of martial arts. Examples of such traits include Shaolinquan  (少林拳) physical exercises involving All Other Animals (五形) mimicry or training methods inspired by Old Chinese philosophies, religions and legends. Styles that focus on qi manipulation are called internal (内家拳; nèijiāquán), while others that concentrate on improving muscle and cardiovascular fitness are called external (外家拳; wàijiāquán). Geographical associations, as in northern (北拳; běiquán) and southern (南拳; nánquán), is another popular classification method.

Terminology
Kung fu and wushu are loanwords from Cantonese and Mandarin respectively that, in English, are used to refer to Chinese martial arts. However, the Chinese terms kung fu and wushu (; Cantonese Yale: móuh seuht) have distinct meanings. The Chinese equivalent of the term ""Chinese martial arts"" would be Zhongguo wushu (Chinese: 中國武術; pinyin: zhōngguó wǔshù) (Mandarin).
In Chinese, the term kung fu refers to any skill that is acquired through learning or practice. It is a compound word composed of the words 功 (gōng) meaning ""work"", ""achievement"", or ""merit"", and 夫 (fū) which is a particle or nominal suffix with diverse meanings.
Wushu literally means ""martial art"". It is formed from the two Chinese characters 武術: 武 (wǔ), meaning ""martial"" or ""military"" and 術 or 术 (shù), which translates into ""art"", ""discipline"", ""skill"" or ""method"". The term wushu has also become the name for the modern sport of wushu, an exhibition and full-contact sport of bare-handed and weapon forms (套路), adapted and judged to a set of aesthetic criteria for points developed since 1949 in the People's Republic of China.
Quánfǎ (拳法) is another Chinese term for Chinese martial arts. It means ""fist method"" or ""the law of the fist"" (quán means ""boxing"" or ""fist"", and fǎ means ""law"", ""way"" or ""method""), although as a compound term it usually translates as ""boxing"" or ""fighting technique."" The name of the Japanese martial art kempō is represented by the same hanzi characters.

History
The genesis of Chinese martial arts has been attributed to the need for self-defense, hunting techniques and military training in ancient China. Hand-to-hand combat and weapons practice were important in training ancient Chinese soldiers.
Detailed knowledge about the state and development of Chinese martial arts became available from the Nanjing decade (1928–1937), as the  Central Guoshu Institute established by the Kuomintang regime made an effort to compile an encyclopedic survey of martial arts schools.
Since the 1950s, the People's Republic of China has organized Chinese martial arts as an exhibition and full-contact sport und",sports
Assumed Incumbency,"The strategy of assumed incumbency is based on a recognition of the value of incumbency in a political campaign.  A high correlation between election and incumbency has been demonstrated in congressional races.  The success rate of incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives seeking re-election averaged 93.5 percent during the 1960s and 1970s.  Statistically, the initial edge for the incumbent candidate is 2-4 percent of the vote.
An incumbent is the person currently holding the office; that held position provides an automatic legitimacy, which usually results in an early conclusion of the person being the frontrunner in the campaign.  Powell and Shelby (1891) claim that being the frontrunner allows the candidate to be able to define the parameters of debate and put the burden of the proof on the challenger. 
The assumed incumbent strategy occurs when a political position becomes open with no incumbent seeking re-election.  The candidate that runs for the now open spot can assume the incumbency role for that position, usually through same-party affiliation. One case study that examined an assumed incumbency looked at Richard Shelby and his congressional campaign in 1978 in Alabama.  At the time, Shelby was an Alabama state senator, and had announced his intentions to run for the state lieutenant governor's position   However, when Congressman Walter Flowers decided to leave his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives and run for a seat in the U.S. Senate, Shelby decided to abandon his campaign for state lieutenant governor and run for Walter's congressional seat.  The congressional seat was now open with no incumbent seeking re-election.  Thus, the decision for Shelby to run was made using the assumed incumbency strategy. 
The strategy of assumed incumbency is developed through three progressive stages that complete a model of spiral progression as follows:

The three stages of the model are as follows:
1. Legitimacy becomes the rhetorical goal of the strategy, and the initial stage of the strategy's development.  This starting point depends on the degree of name recognition that a candidate has with its given audience.  The goal is to generate expectations about the candidate as the likely winner, which is achieved through the rhetorical stance that identifies the candidate as the 'natural choice' for the position sought.  Success comes from identification of the candidate with the incumbent and/or the characteristics of the incumbency.
2. Identification stems from the increased visibility that is given to the candidate during the legitimacy stage, making the candidate a political celebrity.  The goal of this stage is increased voter recognition of a candidate's name.  Press coverage shifts from trying to establish legitimacy to maintaining one's name in the face of the public.
3. Reinforcement occurs when the candidate's campaign reaffirms the legitimacy of the candidate.  If the stages of legitimacy and identification succeed, the",politics
Applied economics,"Applied economics is the application of economic theory and econometrics in specific settings. As one of the two sets of fields of economics (the other set being the core), it is typically characterized by the application of the core, i.e. economic theory and econometrics to address practical issues in a range of fields including  demographic economics, labour economics, business economics, industrial organization, agricultural economics, development economics, education economics, engineering economics, financial economics, health economics, monetary economics, public economics, and economic history. From the perspective of economic development, the purpose of applied economics is to enhance the quality of business practices and national policy making.
The process often involves a reduction in the level of abstraction of this core theory. There are a variety of approaches including not only empirical estimation using econometrics, input-output analysis or simulations but also case studies, historical analogy and so-called common sense or the ""vernacular"".  This range of approaches is indicative of what Roger Backhouse and Jeff Biddle argue is the ambiguous nature of the concept of applied economics. It is a concept with multiple meanings. Among broad methodological distinctions, one source places it in neither positive nor normative economics but the art of economics, glossed as ""what most economists do"".

Origins of the term
The origin and meanings of applied economics have a long history going back to the writing of Say and Mill. Say wrote about ""applying"" the ""general principles of political economy"" to ""ascertain the rule of action of any combination of circumstances presented to us"". The full title of Mill's (1848) work is Principles of Political Economy with Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy.

J.N. Keynes discussion
John Neville Keynes was perhaps the first to use the phrase ""applied economics"". He noted that the ""English School"" (John Stuart Mill, John Elliott Cairnes, and Nassau William Senior) believed that political economy was a positive, abstract, deductive science; and that this school made a clear distinction  ""between political economy itself and its applications to practice"" (1917, 12). This school thought that a general body of theory could be established through abstract reasoning – not relying on a wide knowledge of economic facts. From this point of view applying this theory involved making allowances for some of the factors ignored in building the abstract theories.  Keynes wrote about applying the political economies hypothetical laws to interpreting and explaining of ""concrete industrial facts"". The issue of conceptual distinction between political economy as a science (involving formulating laws which govern  the production and distribution of wealth) and political economy as an art (using the laws to tackle practical problems).

Clinical incidents in Australia,"Any medical incident that causes serious harm or death will be reported as Australian Sentinel Events (SEs or ASE) which is an Australian national serious medical error or incident reporting system. It includes a set of preventable adverse events that result in serious harm or death to a patient. These events are clearly defined and recognized as being preventable if the proper safeguards are in place.
A clinical incident is defined as any event that resulted or could have resulted in minor to serious harm or death to a patient.

History
In 1992, an estimated of 18,000 deaths were associated with adverse events (AE) in Australia.
In 2002, all states and territories have agreed to contribute to a set of 8 categories of the National Sentinel Events (NSEs). Later, a revised Australian Sentinel Events (ASE) list which includes 10 categories was endorsed by Australian Health Ministers in December 2018 .

Regulation
The report of serious clinical incidents including SE are mandatory for all public hospitals and all private licensed health care facilities across Australia.
The ASE or SEs include 10 categories, however different states and territories may have additional categories on the Sentinel Events.
While each state and territory have their own health department to oversee and investigate all clinical incidents, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care is responsible for managing all the incident happened in Australian hospitals, clinics and other communities healthcare facilities in order to improve patient safety.

Type of incident
Each state and territory have their own different type of incident reporting rating system.

New South Wales
Harm Score 1 as the most severe harm including sentinel events, to Harm Score 4 as minor harm or no harm.

Western Australia
In Western Australia, Severity Assessment Codes are used in WA health systems to determine the level of a clinical incidents. Rating from SAC 1 including sentinel event as the severe harm, to SAC 3 as minor or no harm.

Sentinel events
All states and territories have agreed the 10 categories of sentinel event which include:

While some state and territory may have additional category, such as in Victoria has added category 11 of “All other adverse patient safety events resulting in serious harm or death.”

Prevalence
Australian enjoy high-quality healthcare services and one of the best healthcare systems in the world with most incidents recorded are of minor or no harm, a very low rate of medical incidents causing significant harm to patients.
There were 54 sentinel events recorded in 2021-2022 across all Australian states and territories

New South Wales
In 2021, New South Wales has 83,355 incidents in which 96.5% are Harm Score 3 and 4 which are minor or no harm. 0.3% are of Harm Score 1 which include about 20 sentinel events.
Most of the incidents are falls, concerning behavior and skin integrity such as pressure injuries which result in minor or no harm. About 272",medicine
Common front,"In politics, a common front is an alliance between different groups, forces, or interests in pursuit of a common goal or in opposition to a common enemy. Other words that may be used are ""alliance"" or ""coalition"", though the term ""common front"" is often used when groups want to emphasize that their alliance is of a temporary nature and that individual groups within the front maintain their independence and do not consider themselves subservient to a collective leadership.
The practice of uniting with anyone against a common enemy is called frontism. Historically, it has been a practice of Marxist–Leninist parties to unite with non-communist forces in revolution. In left-wing politics, there are two main types of common fronts: the popular front and the united front.

Efficient Voter Rule,"In the study of voter behavior, the efficient voter rule speaks to the desirability of voter-driven outcomes. It applies to situations involving negative externalities such as pollution and crime, and positive externalities such as education. Related efforts to achieve socially optimal quantities of externalities have long been a focus of microeconomic research, most famously by Ronald Coase and Arthur Pigou. Externality problems persist despite past remedies, which makes newer approaches such as the efficient voter rule important.
In the context of negative externalities, the efficient voter rule states that when individuals who receive the same harm from a problem vote on whether to eliminate that problem at a uniform cost per individual, the outcome will be efficient, regardless of each individual’s contribution to the problem. The Rule applies similarly to positive externalities, as exemplified by the solar panel example below.
The efficient voter rule indicates that voting on a collective action or policy change should lead to an efficient outcome. Possible applications include policy decisions about clean energy, noise pollution, over-fishing, mandatory immunizations, smoking bans, zoning, septic systems, and fuel economy standards.
In the context of crime, recent applications include votes on the strict enforcement of traffic laws. The vote in Tucson, Arizona, on whether to use cameras to catch drivers who run red lights provides one example. The community voted against this strict level of enforcement. According to the efficient voter rule, this outcome indicates that community members collectively received a greater benefit from occasionally skirting the law than from protection from malfeasance.
The literature explains why the efficient voter rule applies even if individuals cause differing levels of damage and if a given amount of damage from each individual is completely external.

Example
Consider a policy proposal to require each of the 100 households in an economy to rent a solar panel that costs $400 per year, net of the value of the energy provided to the user. Suppose each panel would prevent $600 worth of harm from pollution in the economy each year. The pollution is uniformly distributed, so each of the 100 households incurs 1/100 × $600 = $6 worth of the harm that could be avoided by each panel yearly.
Although society's $600 annual benefit from each panel exceeds the $400 annual cost, each household only internalizes $6 worth of the environmental benefit—far less than the rental cost of a panel. So the privately optimal decision is to not rent a panel.
To reach the socially optimal decision, residents could vote on the policy proposal. If enacted, the policy would cost each household $400 per year. The total damage each household would avoid each year if the policy were enacted—the household's annual benefit from policy enactment—would be 100 x $6 = $600. So the voting mechanism causes each household to internalize the entir",science
2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference,"The 2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference (officially titled Scientific Review of Vaccine Safety Datalink Information) was a two-day meeting convened in June 2000 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), held at the Simpsonwood Methodist retreat and conference center in Gwinnett County near Norcross, Georgia. The key event at the conference was the presentation of data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink examining the possibility of a link between the mercury compound thimerosol in vaccines and neurological problems in children who had received those vaccines.
A 2005 article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., published by Rolling Stone and Salon.com, focused on the Simpsonwood meeting as part of a conspiracy to withhold or falsify vaccine-safety information. However, Kennedy's article contained numerous major factual errors and, after a number of corrections, was ultimately retracted by Salon.com. Nonetheless, on the basis of Kennedy's claims, the conference gained notoriety in the anti-vaccination movement.

The conference
The conference was convened following a resolution by the Congress of the United States in 1997 requiring the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to review the thimerosal content of approved drugs and biologics. Three vaccines of primary interest were discussed: hepatitis B vaccine, DPT vaccine, and the Hib vaccine.
Attendees included experts in the fields of autism, pediatrics, toxicology, epidemiology and vaccines. Also in attendance were approximately half a dozen public-health organisations and pharmaceutical companies, as well as eleven consultants to the CDC, a rapporteur,  and a statistician. The meeting served as a prelude to vaccine policy meetings held by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which sets U.S. vaccine policy for the CDC. The session was also to serve as the initial meeting of the ACIP work group on thimerosal and immunization.
Presentations and supporting documents from the conference were subject to a news embargo until June 21, 2000, at which point they were published by the ACIP. After the conference, researchers carried out a planned second phase to further analyze and clarify the study's preliminary findings. The results of this second analysis were published in 2003.

In the anti-vaccination movement
The June 20, 2005, issue of Rolling Stone contained an article written by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., entitled ""Deadly Immunity"". The article, which was also published on Salon.com, focused on the Simpsonwood conference, and alleged that government and private industry had colluded to ""thwart the Freedom of Information Act"" and ""withhold"" vaccine-safety findings from the public. Kennedy said that the Simpsonwood data linked thimerosal in vaccines to the rise in autism, but that the lead researcher later ""reworked his data to bury the link between thimerosal and autism."" However, Kennedy's article contained numerous errors, including overstating the amount of ethylmercury in vaccines, wro",medicine
Applied science,"Applied science is the application of the scientific method and scientific knowledge to attain practical goals. It includes a broad range of disciplines, such as engineering and medicine. Applied science is often contrasted with basic science, which is focused on advancing scientific theories and laws that explain and predict natural or other phenomena.
There are applied natural sciences, as well as applied formal and social sciences. Applied science examples include genetic epidemiology which applies statistics and probability theory, and applied psychology, including criminology.

Applied research
Applied research is the use of empirical methods to collect data for practical purposes. It accesses and uses accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques for a specific state, business, or client-driven purpose. In contrast to engineering, applied research does not include analyses or optimization of business, economics, and costs. Applied research can be better understood in any area when contrasting it with basic or pure research. Basic geographical research strives to create new theories and methods that aid in explaining the processes that shape the spatial structure of physical or human environments. Instead, applied research utilizes existing geographical theories and methods to comprehend and address particular empirical issues. Applied research usually has specific commercial objectives related to products, procedures, or services. The comparison of pure research and applied research provides a basic framework and direction for businesses to follow.
Applied research deals with solving practical problems and generally employs empirical methodologies. Because applied research resides in the messy real world, strict research protocols may need to be relaxed. For example, it may be impossible to use a random sample. Thus, transparency in the methodology is crucial. Implications for the interpretation of results brought about by relaxing an otherwise strict canon of methodology should also be considered.
Moreover, this type of research method applies natural sciences to human conditions:

Action research: aids firms in identifying workable solutions to issues influencing them.
Evaluation research: researchers examine available data to assist clients in making wise judgments.
Industrial research: create new goods/services that will satisfy the demands of a target market. (Industrial development would be scaling up production of the new goods/services for mass consumption to satisfy the economic demand of the customers while maximizing the ratio of the good/service output rate to resource input rate, the ratio of good/service revenue to material & energy costs, and the good/service quality. Industrial development would be considered engineering. Industrial development would fall outside the scope of applied research.)

The Establishment (Pakistan),"The Establishment (Urdu: اسٹیبلشمنٹ), also referred to as the military establishment, or deep state, is a term commonly used in Pakistan to describe the influence of the Pakistan Armed Forces, intelligence agencies, and associated pro-military entities within the country's governance structure. 
Since Pakistan's independence in 1947, the Establishment has periodically assumed direct control of the government through military coups and has frequently played a substantial role in influencing political and security policies during civilian administrations. It is widely regarded as an influential force in Pakistan's political and strategic affairs, particularly in areas concerning domestic policies, national security and foreign relations. This includes state policies introduced during various periods of military rule, including the Islamization measures implemented under General Zia-ul-Haq.
In the 2000s, the military establishment later reversed its support of political Islam under General Pervez Musharraf, who pursued enlightened moderation, leading Pakistan to join the United States-led War on terror and subsequently becoming designated as a major non-NATO ally by the Bush administration. Furthermore, in the 2010s, General Raheel Sharif pursued a policy of hardline crackdowns on Islamist militant groups, continuing this reversal of Zia-ul-Haq's aggressive pro-Islamist policies. Civilian members of the military-dominated Establishment have included: Sharifuddin Pirzada, Tariq Azim Khan, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan A. K. Brohi, Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Zafar Ahmed Ansari.

Reinforcement of deep-state dominance
The Establishment is notable for its covert interventions and organisation of military coups against the civilian government, and was reportedly behind the 1953–54 Constitutional Coup in the Dominion of Pakistan. It also organised the coups of 1958, 1977, and 1999. The Pakistan Army has been involved in enforcing martial law against civilian governments under the claim of restoring law and order in the country as is its role in the Constitution of Pakistan. It has dismissed the legislative branch and parliament a total of four times since Pakistan's independence, and maintains wider commercial, foreign, and political interests in the country. Due to this imbalance of power, the Pakistani military has faced allegations of acting as a state within a state.

Characteristics and composition
Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani journalist and scholar, notes that the Establishment is overwhelmingly dominated by the Pakistan Armed Forces (i.e. serving and retired officers, SPDF personnel, military-sponsored think-tanks etc.), with its core members also including civil bureaucrats, politicians, media houses and major economic players. Abubakar Siddique, a Bangladeshi writer, observed that the civilians involved with the Establishment, such as politicians and judges, are also very ""pro-military"".

P. K. Sen (surgeon),"Prafulla Kumar Sen MD (7 December 1915 – 22 July 1982) was an Indian vascular and cardiothoracic surgeon, who led the world's sixth attempt of human heart transplant and India's first in 1968. It dubbed him the fourth surgeon in the world to carry out this operation.
Sen was active in establishing postgraduate programmes in surgical training and one of the early surgeons to perform aortic surgery in India in the 1950s. After being the first in India to perform a closed mitral valvotomy in 1952, within a year he repaired a coarctation of the aorta and by 1956 he had successfully attempted the first direct vision closure of an atrial septal defect. In the 1950s he turned his attention from aortic surgery to open heart surgery following numerous experiments on dogs. He subsequently led teams that performed two heart transplants in Bombay in 1968. Both recipients died on the day of their operation.
Sen was, in addition, a poet and painter. His paintings were displayed once in the United States, and twice in India.

Early life and education
Prafulla Kumar Sen, popularly known as P. K. Sen, was born on 7 December 1915 in Calcutta, British India. He had one sister and his father was a civil servant.
He began his early education at a public school in Jamtada, Bihar, before attending the Victoria College of Sciences, Nagpur. Subsequently, Sen gained admission to medicine at the G.S. Medical College, Bombay, where he studied between 1933 and 1938, before passing his MBBS. In 1940, he achieved a distinction in his master of surgery (MS) degree at the University of Bombay.

Surgical career
Sen's internships and surgical training were completed at King Edward VII Memorial Hospital (KEM), Bombay between 1938 and 1943, after which he returned to G.S. Medical College as assistant honorary surgeon. Initially, he received aid from the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). He was frequently in dispute with the Bombay Municipal Corporation who were more concerned with providing for diseases of poverty and over population. However, he was ambitious, a ""buccaneer"" and had a wish to extend Indian medicine into the rapidly growing and exciting arena of open heart surgery. He was inspired by Charaka but also paid tribute to Western medical pioneers including John Hunter and Alexis Carrel.

Pennsylvania
In 1949, following an application for a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and the subsequent endorsement by Isidor Schwaner Ravdin, chair of surgery at the University of Pennsylvania at their request, Sen travelled to the University of Pennsylvania in the United States to work for six months with thoracic surgeon James Hardy. Their research on the ""impact of surgery on adrenocortical activity"" was presented at the American College of Surgeons in Boston in October 1950 and later, amidst the backdrop of racial unrest in the U.S. and an incident in which Sen was nearly barred from a hotel, at the American Physiological Society in Atlanta.

Australian handball,"Australian handball is a sport in which players hit a ball against one or more walls. Similar in gameplay to Gaelic, Welsh and American handball, it has been played formally in Australia since 1923.

Play
Australian handball is similar to squash played without a racquet. The ball is served such that it makes direct contact with the front wall without having bounced on the ground. It must then be returned similarly by the opponent to the front wall before the ball bounces on the ground twice.  It may also contact side walls to or from the front wall, but once a player has struck the ball with hand, it must make contact with the front before touching the ground.
The game is played in singles or doubles format. There are 1, 3 or 4 wall versions of this game. The typical Australian version is the three wall version, as most courts in Australia are set for this version. Perhaps the bulk of these playing venues are set in various private Catholic Colleges.

History and development
Introduction
Although its formal beginnings in Australia date from 1923, it has been played in some capacity or another since the 19th century. A similar game was introduced from Ireland and the first Australian Handball court was built by Melbourne hotel-keeper, Michael Lynch, in 1847.

Schoolboys
Its early development has been attributed to the work of Christian Brothers' Colleges.
Handball was very strongly promoted among the students at Christian Brothers' Colleges, driven by the Brothers' view that handball ""affords an excellent preparatory training for football, as it calls into play all the resources of the physical man"", and is one of the best ways for a potential Australian Rules footballer to acquire the optimum level of hand–eye coordination, ambidexterity, smoothness and flexibility, and sense of where one is in time and space (e.g., Bill Serong who played in three Grand Finals for Collingwood, went to the Christian Brothers' College in Victoria Parade, and was the Australian handball champion in 1974, aged 38).

National competition
Over most of its history, its primary play has been in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. As the game continued to develop, by 1970, there were about 1,000 players registered within the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian state associations.
For many decades, the Australian Handball Council has held almost annual national championships, and each state has held its own state titles. Senior titles have not been the only level of keen interest and activity, however.  During the 1950s' and 1960s, both – the Australian Singles Schoolboys Handball Championships and the Australian Doubles Schoolboys Handball Championships – were held on regular bases.  Many great champions of the past were 'blooded' on these schoolboy rivalries. Additionally, over many decades Australians have made regular appearances at the World Junior and World Senior Titles. Within Australia, of more recent decades, the chief rivalries have been b",sports
Quantum social science,"Quantum social science is an emerging field of interdisciplinary research which draws parallels between quantum physics and the social sciences. Although there is no settled consensus on a single approach, a unifying theme is that, while the social sciences have long modelled themselves on mechanistic science, they can learn much from quantum ideas such as complementarity and entanglement. Some authors are motivated by quantum mind theories that the brain, and therefore human interactions, are literally based on quantum processes, while others are more interested in taking advantage of the quantum toolkit to simulate social behaviours which elude classical treatment. Quantum ideas have been particularly influential in psychology but are starting to affect other areas such as international relations and diplomacy in what one 2018 paper called a ""quantum turn in the social sciences"".

History
The idea that quantum physics might play an important role in living systems has long been considered by physicists. Niels Bohr for example believed that his principle of complementarity extended into both biology and psychology, while Erwin Schrödinger wrote in his 1944 book What is Life? of a ""quantum theory of biology"" that saw genetic mutations in terms of quantum leaps. In his 1989 book The Emperor's New Mind, Roger Penrose hypothesized that quantum mechanics plays an essential role in human consciousness. His 1994 follow-up book Shadows of the Mind speculated that these quantum processes take place in microtubules inside neurons.
Some physicists have also been willing to consider an even more direct connection between mind and quantum matter, in a quantum version of panpsychism. In his 1975 book Disturbing the Universe, Freeman Dyson wrote that ""mind is already inherent in every electron, and the processes of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the processes of choice between quantum states"". David Bohm's 1951 book Quantum Theory included a chapter on ""Analogies to Quantum Processes"" where he considered applications including the understanding of thought processes, and in 1990 he published a paper named ""A new theory of the relationship of mind and matter"" which asserts that consciousness permeates all forms of matter. These ideas were popularised and extended by Danah Zohar in books including The Quantum Self and (with Ian Marshall) The Quantum Society. Karen Barad's 2007 book Meeting the Universe Halfway took ""Niels Bohr's philosophy-physics"" as a starting point to develop her theory of agential realism.
Beginning in the 1990s, a separate approach to quantum social science was taken by a number of interdisciplinary researchers, working in what became known as quantum cognition, who argued that quantum probability theory was better than classical probability theory at accounting for a range of cognitive effects of the sort studied in behavioral economics. Others worked on developing ""weak"" or ""generalised"" versions of quantum ",science

Broadband
Brunei's Internet service was monopolized by Telekom Brunei. ADSL speeds were ranging from 512 kbit/s to the maximum speed of 1 Mbit/s through ADSL2+ broadband. 1 Mbit/s was introduced in 2006 and was priced at BND$128 per month (Equivalent to Singapore currency). It was well known that the Brunei's broadband ranging from 512 kbit/s to 1 Mbit/s is one of the most expensive in the world. The limited market in Brunei means that new developments in the telecommunications sector is stagnant.
In 2002, Telekom Brunei was incorporated become Telekom Brunei Berhad (TelBru). In 2008, the internet were improved with dramatically with speeds ranging from 1 Mbit/s to maximum speed of 5 Mbit/s. Price starting from B$65 to B$105 per month respectively.

In 2012, Telekom Brunei started deploying its FTTH network capable of 100 Mbit/s through a contract awarded to Huawei. They aimed to provide FTTH coverage to around 85% of the population by 2017.
In 2016 Telbru drastically reduced the price and increased the speeds of its broadband plans. Due to the fact that a significant number of people were now connected via FTTH and not via the old copper cables.

On 1 March 2018 Telbru rolled out their new 'high speed' broadband plans They also split the plans which have unlimited quota into 'unlimited plans'
In 2017 Forbes reported that Brunei had the 4th most expensive broadband service in the world

On 4 September 2019, The UNN took over all of the telecommunications infrastructure in Brunei. By doing so they aimed to provide equal infrastructure to all the isps in the country. This brought an end to a long held monopoly by Imagine Sdn Bhd (Formerly Known as Telbru) over the home broadband market with the introduction of Datastream Digital's 'Infinity' home broadband plans on 24 January 2020.

History,"History is the systematic study of the past. As an academic discipline, it analyzes and interprets evidence to construct narratives about what happened and explain why it happened, focusing primarily on the human past. Some theorists categorize history as a social science, while others see it as part of the humanities or consider it a hybrid discipline. Similar debates surround the purpose of history—for example, whether its main aim is theoretical, to uncover the truth, or practical, to learn lessons from the past. In a more general sense, the term history refers not to an academic field but to the past itself, times in the past, or to individual texts about the past.
Historical research relies on primary and secondary sources to reconstruct past events and validate interpretations. Source criticism is used to evaluate these sources, assessing their authenticity, content, and reliability. Historians integrate the perspectives of several individual sources to develop a coherent narrative. Different schools of thought, such as positivism, the Annales school, Marxism, and postmodernism, have distinct methodological approaches.
History is a broad discipline encompassing many branches. Some focus on specific time periods, such as ancient history, while others concentrate on particular geographic regions, such as the history of Africa. Thematic categorizations include political history, social history, and economic history. Branches associated with specific research methods and sources include quantitative history, comparative history, and oral history.
History emerged as a field of inquiry in antiquity to replace myth-infused narratives, with influential early traditions originating in Greece, China, and later in the Islamic world. Historical writing evolved throughout the ages and became increasingly professional, particularly during the 19th century, when a rigorous methodology and various academic institutions were established. History is related to many fields, including historiography, philosophy, education, and politics.

Definition
As an academic discipline, history is the study of the past. It conceptualizes and describes what happened by collecting and analysing evidence to construct narratives. These narratives cover not only how events unfolded but also why they happened and in which contexts, providing an explanation of relevant background conditions and causal mechanisms. History further examines the meaning of historical events and the underlying human motives driving them.
In a slightly different sense, history refers to the past events themselves. Under this interpretation, history is what happened rather than the academic field studying what happened. When used as a countable noun, a history is a representation of the past in the form of a history text. History texts are cultural products involving active interpretation and reconstruction. The narratives presented in them can change as historians discover new evidence or reinterpret ",history
Drawbridge mentality,"Drawbridge mentality, also known as fortress mentality is a conservative and anti-immigrant attitude of prior immigrants in an established community. Drawbridge mentality can encompass denying immigration to people, businesses and also denying building developments which could facilitate immigration, such as affordable housing. The conflict of drawbridge mentality often emerges between city councils which wish to expand, and residents concerned about losing property value or other economic or political assets.
It is often unclear whether the intention of certain policies is to achieve a drawbridge mentality, or if the policies have other economic or political goals. For example, impact fees reduce immigration by raising entry costs, but can also be argued to offset lowering property taxes. The drawbridge mentality can allow governments or communities to avoid providing humanitarian aid to immigrants by denying responsibility entirely. 
The term can imply a selfish attitude and can be taken as an insult, and it often overlaps with the Not in My Back Yard attitude. The drawbridge mentality is one of many ways in which residents can respond to change, viewed as conservatively preserving the existing status quo. 
There are many different reasons for immigration, for example due to ecological collapse by droughts and famine caused by physical and climate changes, floods, cyclones, and other natural disasters. There are also other economic and political factors motivating immigration. However, drawbridge mentality not generally concerned about the reason for immigration. Instead, the main focus is on social and economic effects of immigration like the changing urban density, property values, predominant lifestyles and cultures, and whether these changes are desirable for existing residents.

Examples
Eli Home in Anaheim Hills, California
Eli Home, a nonprofit organisation founded in the 1980s which maintains homeless shelters for abused children, tried to expand to Anaheim Hills in 1994. The organisation was endorsed and praised by former United States presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, but Anaheim Hills community residents were strongly opposed to the decision, and tried to stop the development. The Not in My Back Yard attitude was the main reasoning for the opposition, suggesting that the shelter will increase crime rates and make neighborhoods less friendly. The development was nonetheless approved by the council and later led to an exodus of Anaheim Hills residents. Since then, Eli Home as an organisation claims to serve over 1,000 abused children and their families annually, and also expanded services to drug rehabilitation, although the organisation had low donations in the decades since.

Economics of bitcoin,"Bitcoin was designed by its pseudonymous inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, to work as a currency, but its status as a currency is disputed. Economists define money as a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account, and agree that bitcoin does not currently meet all these criteria.

Classification
Bitcoin was designed by its inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, to work as a currency. It is commonly referred to with terms like: digital currency,: 1  digital cash, virtual currency, electronic currency, digital gold, or cryptocurrency.
The question whether bitcoin is a currency or not is disputed. Bitcoins have three useful qualities in a currency, according to The Economist in January 2015: they are ""hard to earn, limited in supply and easy to verify"". Economists define money as a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account, and agree that bitcoin has some way to go to meet all these criteria. It does best as a medium of exchange: for at least the period March 2014 to July 2023 the bitcoin market suffered from volatility, limiting the ability of bitcoin to act as a stable store of value, and retailers accepting bitcoin use other currencies as their principal unit of account.
Classification of bitcoin by the United States government is to date unclear with multiple conflicting rulings. In 2013 Judge Amos L. Mazzant III of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas stated that ""Bitcoin is a currency or form of money"". In July 2016, Judge Teresa Mary Pooler of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court of Florida cleared Michell Espinoza in State of Florida v. Espinoza in money-laundering charges he faced involving his use of bitcoin. Judge Pooler stated ""Bitcoin may have some attributes in common with what we commonly refer to as money, but differ in many important aspects, they are certainly not tangible wealth and cannot be hidden under a mattress like cash and gold bars."" In September 2016, a ruling by Judge Alison J. Nathan of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York contradicted the Florida Espinoza ruling stating ""Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term.— Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment."" The U.S. Treasury categorizes bitcoin as a decentralized virtual currency. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission classifies bitcoin as a commodity, and the Internal Revenue Service classifies it as an asset.
The South African Revenue Service, the legislation of Canada, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic and several others classify bitcoin as an intangible asset.
The Bundesbank says that bitcoin is not a virtual currency or digital money. It recommends using the term ""crypto token"".
The People's Bank of China has stated that bitcoin ""is fundamentally not a currency but an investment tar",economics
Economics of open data,"The economics of open data refers to the production, or loss, of wealth related to the use of open data. The cost of open data is a primary concern that can deter governments any companies from the opening up of data. While open data may theoretically have a low production cost, the cost of creating the original data set as well as maintaining that data once it is produced can be expensive. Though the creation of data may be expensive governments around the world such as France, the United States, and Japan, are anticipating substantial economic growth.

Open Data vs. Paid Data
Open data has the capability to increase economic benefit through both individuals' and companies' use of the information. As of March 2016, it was estimated that open data was generating 0.5% more GDP compared to paid data. The creation of open data relies on either funding from government to create and maintain the data or funding in the form of grants and volunteers. Data made open by governments largely relies on the publication of public service research. Because the data has already been created for a purpose, there is no creation cost for it to be made available to the public.
The opening of data requires current and advance technologies as well as the employment of users who are skilled enough to complete such work. When data is collected it cannot be presented to the public in its raw form and may be inaccessible due to the program is uses or how the data is presented may be unusable. Time and funding is required to be reallocated by those who create the original dataset in order to make the data more accessible and usable for citizens to understand and engage with. When government is the main source of funding for the production of data it does not necessarily mean that they are the singular entity creating or managing the data. Governments sometimes contract out the creation or management of data to a third party. In some cases the third party may provide access to the data in exchange for a nominal fee. Citizen led initiatives face similar issues, such as the requirement of time and funding. For these types of initiatives it can be especially difficult because they do not have access to a guaranteed steady income such as taxpayer money; these organizations largely depend on donations.
Paying for the use of public data would cover some of the costs associated with creating, maintaining and formatting data, although it would reduced the economic value of what once was opened by 50%. Paying for the data that is now available for free would result in a lack of innovation, decreasing the GDP, as well as an increase in the cost of services created from use of purchased data. The opening of data reduces costs associated with licensing that is usually associated with paid data, as it costs more money to license a dataset than to have no license at all, though there are open datasets that use licensing as well. The opening of data itself does not simply create economic ",economics
Kiiking,"Kiiking (Estonian pronunciation: [ˈkiːkiŋ]) is a sport which involves a person making a swing gain increasingly more momentum, to pass over the spindle with the longest shafts possible. It was invented in Estonia by Ado Kosk in 1993; in Estonian, kiik means a swing.
In a kiiking swing, the swing arms are made of steel to enable a person to swing 360 degrees going over the fulcrum of the swing. A person is fastened to the swing base by their feet. To swing, the person begins to pump by squatting and standing up on the swing. The swing will gain momentum and will, by skillful pumping, take a person over the fulcrum.
Kiiking is regulated by the Estonian Kiiking Association.

History
The practice of swinging has had an important place in Estonian culture for a long time. Traditional village swings have been prevalent in rural communal lands for centuries, places where villagers held festivities. The construction of kiiking swings is radically different from village swings, however.
The first kiiking swing was made by Ado Kosk in 1993.  Kosk observed that it becomes more difficult to swing over the fulcrum as the arms of the swing become longer. He then designed telescoping swing arms to gradually extend the arms for an increased challenge. The person able to swing over the fulcrum with the longest swing arms is the winner.  The first modern kiiking swing with adjustable shafts was made in 1996.

Kiikingswing types
There are three models of swings:

KIKI1 – shaft height 3–4m
KIKI2 – shaft height 4–6m
KIKI3 – shaft height 6–8m

Records
The current Estonian record as well as Guinness World Record for longest swing shafts was set in 2022 by Estonian Sven Saarpere, with 7.43 metres. Estonian Kätlin Kink holds the women's Guinness World Record of 5.93 m, while the Estonian women's record of 6.08 m is held by Helga Ehrenbusch.
An American record of 5.66 m was set by Matt Dart of Georgia in 2015. Maxwell White of Auckland set a New Zealand record of 4.83 m in 2012.

History of the Aurès,"The Aurès Mountains are located in northeastern Algeria and are part of the Saharan Atlas in the Maghreb region of Northwest Africa. The indigenous inhabitants of the Aurès are the Chaoui people, who are part of the broader Berber (Amazigh) community. The history of the Aurès dates back to prehistoric times.

Prehistory
Aïn Hanech
Aïn Hanech is a Paleolithic archaeological site in the Aurès region that has provided evidence of hominin presence in North Africa as early as 1.7 million years ago (mya). Stone tools have been discovered in stratified archaeological layers at this site, dating to the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya–11,700 years ago). Archaeologist Mohamed Sahnouni and his colleagues uncovered Oldowan chipped stone tools, including simple faceted spherical stones, alongside animal fossils from the same epoch.

Capsian civilization
The Capsian civilization was widespread around the Mediterranean Sea from approximately 8000 to 2700 BCE. Evidence of Capsian settlements is found in their escargotières or middens, which are mounds containing archaeological materials such as ash, stone tools, animal bones (including those of gazelles, aurochs, and wildebeests), and land snail shells. Additionally, there is evidence of rock art, sculpting, polishing, pottery, and farming. Notable mound sites include Medjez Amar and Mechta Sidi El Arbi in the Constantine region.

Antiquity
During antiquity, the Aurès region was inhabited by the Gaetuli (Zenata) and the Sanhaja, along with a minority of Garamantes. The Mausoleum of Medracen (also known as Medghassen), located in Boumia, north of the Aurès massif, dates back to 300 BCE. This Numidian monument is the oldest mausoleum in Algeria. 
The Aurès region is believed to have been central to the Zenata people, including groups such as the Maghrawas, Banu Ifran, Djerawa, and Merinids. According to the contentious hypothesis proposed by Ibn Khaldun, Medghassen may have been the patriarch of the Zenata.

Massylii
The Massylii were an ancient Berber tribal confederation associated with the Numidian kingdom. The Aurès region was crucial to the Massylii, encompassing the majority of their territory and serving as a cultural nexus. Their capital, Cirta, was also located within this region.

Numidia
Born around 238 BCE into the Massylian tribe, Massinissa played a crucial role in unifying Numidia, including the Aurès region. After his reign, several of his successors, including his grandson Jugurtha, sought refuge on the high plateau now named after him. This plateau, located near the present-day city of Kalaat es Senam in Tunisia, close to the massif's border, became a stronghold for resisting Roman invasions.

Roman period
The Aurès region was home to several Roman settlements, including notable examples such as Timgad (Thamugadi), a well-preserved Roman city founded in the 1st century AD, and Cuicul (Djemila), renowned for its impressive Roman ruins. These settlements served as important hubs for trade, administratio",history
Diabetes self-management,"Diabetes self-management refers to the ongoing process in which individuals with diabetes actively participate in managing their condition through lifestyle choices, medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring, and education, aimed at maintaining optimal blood sugar levels and preventing complications.
Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting over 537 million adults worldwide in 2021 and predicted to reach 643 million people by 2030. It is a global health burden and improving the health outcomes for people with diabetes is critical to reducing the economic and human burden of diabetes. Self-management is the cornerstone for successful health outcomes in diabetes patients as there is a positive association between self-management behaviour and care outcomes. Self-management stresses the importance of the role of an individual and their responsibility in developing skilled behaviours to manage one's own illness.

Self-management activities
Healthcare organisations are increasingly focusing on providing diabetes self-management education and support programs to enable diabetes patients to effective self-management. Diabetes patients face daily challenges due to the impact of their decisions on their health outcomes. Diabetes self-management helps diabetes patients to make better decisions and change their behaviour to achieve better outcomes. Diabetes self-management activities mainly consist of seven self-care behaviours. They are healthy eating, monitoring indicators of diabetes, physical activity, taking medication, healthy coping, and problem-solving.

Foot care
Diabetes patients with peripheral neuropathy and peripheral artery disease are at risk of developing foot ulcers and infection. Poor knowledge about self-care increases the risk of amputation.  Adoption of suitable preventative measures and early treatment of diabetic foot problems are important components of diabetes foot care.  Good knowledge and practice regarding diabetes foot care can reduce the risk of foot complications and amputation. Regular examination of the foot is one of the fundamental steps to modifying the foot risk factors thereby reducing the risk of ulceration and amputation. Footwear tailored to the specific pathology of the patient can enable conservative management of the foot including debridement of the callus. Appropriate footwear can reduce abnormal pressure, reduce the rate of formation callus and ulcers and protect the foot from external trauma.

Blood glucose monitoring
Regular monitoring of blood glucose and optimal glucose control is a major part of diabetes self-management. Diabetes patients need to be capable of testing blood sugar at home at the recommended frequency. Frequent self- monitoring of blood glucose and record keeping is key to identifying the possibility of hypoglycemia. Diabetes patients should be able to know how to respond when blood sugar levels are too high or too low.

By ideological classification (historiography)
Although there is arguably some intrinsic bias in history studies (with national bias perhaps being the most significant), history can also be studied from ideological perspectives, such as:

Marxist historiography
Feminist history
A type of historical speculation known commonly as counterfactual history has also been adopted by some historians as a means of assessing and exploring the possible outcomes if certain events had not occurred or had occurred in a different manner. This is somewhat similar to the alternate history genre of fiction.

Economics of Christmas,"The economics of Christmas are significant because Christmas is typically a high-volume selling season for goods suppliers around the world. Sales increase dramatically as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies to celebrate. In the U.S., the ""Christmas shopping season"" starts as early as October. In Canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns just before Halloween (31 October), and step up their marketing following Remembrance Day on 11 November. In the UK and Ireland, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid-November, around the time when high street Christmas lights are turned on. In the United States, it has been calculated that about one fifth of retail sales to one quarter of all personal spending takes place during the Christmas/holiday shopping season. Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8 billion in November 2004 to $31.9 billion in December 2004, an increase of 54 percent. In other sectors, the pre-Christmas increase in spending was even greater, due to a November through December buying surge of 100% in bookstores and 170% in jewelry stores. In the same year employment in American retail stores rose from 1.6 million to 1.8 million in the two months leading up to Christmas. This means that while consumers might spend more during this season, they also are given increased employment opportunities as sales rise to meet the increased demand.
Industries completely dependent on Christmas include Christmas cards, of which 1.9 billion are sent in the United States each year, and live Christmas trees, of which 20.8 million were cut in the U.S. in 2002. In most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In England and Wales, the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. Film studios release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, fantasy movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the Academy Awards.

One economist's analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a deadweight loss under orthodox microeconomic theory, because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone. Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as white elep",economics
Machine Age,"The Machine Age is an era that includes the early-to-mid 20th century, sometimes also including the late 19th century. An approximate dating would be about 1880 to 1945. Considered to be at its peak in the time between the first and second world wars, the Machine Age overlaps with the late part of the Second Industrial Revolution (which ended around 1914 at the start of World War I) and continues beyond it until 1945 at the end of World War II. The 1940s saw the beginning of the Atomic Age, where modern physics saw new applications such as the atomic bomb, the first computers, and the transistor. The Digital Revolution ended the intellectual model of the machine age founded in the mechanical and heralding a new more complex model of high technology.  The digital era has been called the Second Machine Age, with its increased focus on machines that do mental tasks.

Late modern period,"In many periodizations of human history, the late modern period followed the early modern period. It began around 1800 and, depending on the author, either ended with the beginning of contemporary history in 1945, or includes the contemporary history period to the present day.
Notable historical events in the late 18th century, that marked the transition from the early modern period to the late modern period, include: the American Revolution (1765–91), French Revolution (1789–99), and beginning of the Industrial Revolution around 1760.

Definition
Possible end of the Late Modern period
There are differing approaches to defining a possible end or conclusion to the Late Modern period, or indeed whether it might be considered to have concluded at all. If that period is indeed concluded, then there are various options for how to label the subsequent era, i.e. the current contemporary era, as described below.

The Information Age is a historical period that began in the mid-20th century, characterized by a rapid epochal shift from traditional industry established by the Industrial Revolution to an economy primarily based upon information technology.
Some researchers typify the end of the Late Modern period by the concerns for the environment which began in 1950, as this marks the end of modern confidence about humanity's domination of the natural world.
The Postmodern era is the economic or cultural state or condition of society which is said to exist after modernity. Some schools of thought hold that modernity ended in the late 20th century – in the 1980s or early 1990s – and that it was replaced by postmodernity, and still others would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity, while some believe that modernity ended sometime after World War II. The idea of the post-modern condition is sometimes characterized as a culture stripped of its capacity to function in any linear or autonomous state, such as e.g. regressive isolationism, as opposed to the progressive mind state of modernism.
Postmodernism is an intellectual stance or mode of discourse defined by an attitude of skepticism toward what it describes as the grand narratives and ideologies of modernism. It questions or criticizes viewpoints associated with Enlightenment rationality dating back to the 17th century.
The Post-industrial society is the stage of society's development when the service sector generates more wealth than the manufacturing sector of the economy. The term was originated by Alain Touraine and is closely related to similar sociological theoretical concepts such as post-Fordism, information society, knowledge economy, post-industrial economy, liquid modernity, and network society. They all can be used in economics or social science disciplines as a general theoretical backdrop in research design. As the term has been used, a few common themes have begun to emerge. Firstly, the economy undergoes a transition from the production of goods to the provisio",history

Kick-to-kick,"Kick-to-kick is a pastime and well-known tradition of Australian rules football fans, and a recognised Australian term for kick and catch type games. It is a casual version of Australian rules (similar to the relationship between backyard/beach cricket and the established forms of cricket).
Although not a sport in itself, the term is used to describe a social exercise played in parks, fields, streets, back yards and also as a playground game that requires at least two people. Kick-to-kick is used as a warm-up exercise of many Australian rules football clubs and has been the beginnings of many clubs in far-flung places. 
It has long been a pitch invasion tradition in the breaks immediately after official Australian rules football matches, although as professionalism in the Australian Football League increased, the practice was discontinued at most AFL venues. In recent years, kick-to-kick games have been usually limited to two or three per round, usually between clubs that have friendly relations (that is, not likely to cause conflict if fans from opposing teams meet on the field, such as Collingwood), or those designated ""Kids Go Free"" games by the home team. Sponsored by McDonalds and labelled as the ""fifth quarter"", such events are advertised on the AFL website, that week's edition of the AFL Record and is announced via the PA system during the third-quarter time break. Fans are only allowed on following the sounding of a siren, once the centre square has been demarcated and players/media vacating the field, and usually have 15 minutes to roam the field.

Informal kick-to-kick
The two players will space themselves about 15 metres or more apart and alternate kicking whilst the other marks.  Sometimes players will run and/or bounce when returning a long ball and experiment with different kicking styles, such as the drop punt, torpedo punt or checkside punt.  If goal posts are present, participants will often position themselves in front and behind the posts to practice scoring.  Kick-to-kick is often a family pastime and many footballers learned their skills in games of backyard kick-to-kick.  It has been suggested that informal kick-to-kick can assist in battling obesity in children.

Variations
More formal kick-to-kick can involve multiple players, usually grouped in two bunches at either end for easier return of the ball, resulting in similar informal games, such as Force 'em back.  This type of play can include some play contesting, many Australian rules fans requiring a stepladder player to emulate the specky or spectacular mark seen on the football field, often also heard crying out famous names of spectacular mark proponents such as Jesaulenko, Ablett or Capper.

Origins of the pastime
The ancient indigenous Australian game of Marn Grook, which is believed by some to have influenced Australian rules football is similar in many ways to the modern varieties of the kick-to-kick pastime.
Author Sean Fagan claims that the kick-to-kick tradition",sports
The enemy of my enemy is my friend,"""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is an ancient proverb which suggests that two parties can or should work together against a common enemy. The exact meaning of the modern phrase was first expressed in the Latin phrase ""Amicus meus, inimicus inimici mei"" (""my friend, the enemy of my enemy""), which had become common throughout Europe by the early 18th century, while the first recorded use of the current English version came in 1884.

Examples
Rajamandala
A Sanskrit treatise on statecraft, the Arthashastra of Kautilya states:

The king who is situated anywhere immediately on the circumference of the conqueror's territory is termed the enemy.The king who is likewise situated close to the enemy, but separated from the conqueror only by the enemy, is termed the friend (of the conqueror).
A neighboring power would be the first to dispute control of territory, and therefore Kautilya finds neighboring kings to be natural enemies of any conqueror. A king whose territories border those of the enemy would also have this relationship with them, and therefore be a natural ally. This system of relationships was termed Rajamandala (meaning circle of kings) and informed the foreign policy of Chandragupta's Empire. This early theory of geopolitics is still recognized today as the Mandala theory of foreign relations.

World War II
The idea that ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" functioned in various guises as foreign policy by the Allies during World War II. In Europe, tension was common between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. Despite their inherent differences, they recognized a need to work together to meet the threat of Nazi aggression under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. Both U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill were wary of the Soviet Union under the leadership of Joseph Stalin. However, both developed policies with an understanding that Soviet cooperation was necessary for the Allied war effort to succeed. There is a quote from Winston Churchill made to his personal secretary John Colville on the eve of Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa). He was quoted as saying, ""if Hitler invaded Hell, I would make at least a favourable reference to the Devil in the House of Commons."" Stalin reciprocated these feelings towards his Western allies. He was distrustful and feared that they would negotiate a separate peace with Nazi Germany. However, he also viewed their assistance as critical in resisting the Nazi invasion.
The doctrine of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" was employed by nation states in regions outside of the European theater as well. In the Second Sino-Japanese War, within the Pacific theater, an alliance was formed between Chinese Communists and Chinese Nationalists. Leading up to this, these forces had battled each other throughout the Chinese Civil War. However, they formed an alliance, the Second United Front in response to the mutual threat of Japanese aggression",politics
Executive agency,"An executive agency is a part of a government department that is treated as managerially and budgetarily separate, to carry out some part of the executive functions of the United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government or Northern Ireland Executive. Executive agencies are ""machinery of government"" devices distinct both from non-ministerial government departments and non-departmental public bodies (or ""quangos""), each of which enjoy legal and constitutional separation from ministerial control.  The model has been applied in several other countries.

Size and scope
Agencies include well-known organisations such as His Majesty's Prison Service and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The annual budget for each agency, allocated by HM Treasury, ranges from a few million pounds for the smallest agencies to £700m for the Court Service. Virtually all government departments have at least one agency.

Issues and reports
The initial success or otherwise of executive agencies was examined in the Sir Angus Fraser's Fraser Report of 1991. Its main goal was to identify what good practices had emerged from the new model and spread them to other agencies and departments. The report also recommended further powers be devolved from ministers to chief executives.
A series of reports and white papers examining governmental delivery were published throughout the 1990s, under both Conservative and Labour governments. During these the agency model became the standard model for delivering public services in the United Kingdom. By 1997, 76% of civil servants were employed by an agency. The new Labour government in its first such report – the 1998 Next Steps Report – endorsed the model introduced by its predecessor. A later review (in 2002, linked below) made two central conclusions (their emphasis):

""The agency model has been a success. Since 1988 agencies have transformed the landscape of government and the responsive and effectiveness of services delivered by Government.""
Some agencies have, however, become disconnected from their departments ... The gulf between policy and delivery is considered by most to have widened.""
The latter point is usually made more forcefully by critics of the government, describing agencies as ""unaccountable quangos"".

Youth culture,"Youth culture refers to the societal norms of children, adolescents, and young adults. Specifically, it comprises the processes and symbolic systems that are shared by the youth and are distinct from those of adults in the community. 
An emphasis on clothes, popular music, sports, vocabulary, and dating typically sets youth apart from other age groups. Within youth culture, there are many constantly changing youth subcultures, which may be divided based on race, ethnicity, economic status, public appearance, or a variety of other factors.

Existence
There is a debate surrounding the presence, existence, and origins of youth culture. Some researchers argue that youth culture is not a separate culture, as their values and morals are not distinct from those of their parents. Additionally, peer influence varies greatly among contexts, gender, age, and social status, making a single ""youth culture"" difficult to define. which differ from those of their parent's culture. Janssen et al. used the terror management theory (TMT) to argue for the existence of youth culture. They tested the following hypothesis: ""If youth culture serves to help adolescents deal with problems of vulnerability and finiteness, then reminders of mortality should lead to increased allegiance to cultural practices and beliefs of the youth."" The results supported the hypothesis and the outcome of previous studies, and suggest that youth culture is a culture.
Schwartz and Merten used adolescent language to argue that youth culture is distinct from the rest of society. Schwartz argued that high school students used their vocabulary to create meanings that are distinct to adolescents. Specifically, the adolescent status terminology (the words that adolescents use to describe hierarchical social statuses) contains qualities and attributes that are not present in adult status judgments. According to Schwartz, this reflects a difference in social structures and the ways that adults and teens experience social reality. This difference indicates cultural differences between adolescents and adults, which supports the presence of separate youth culture.

Movements
Throughout the twentieth century, youth have had a strong influence on both lifestyle and culture. The flappers and the Mods are two examples of the impact of youth culture on society. The flappers were young women that were confident about a prosperous future after World War I. This liveliness showed in their new attitudes in life in which they openly drank, smoked, and, in some cases, socialized with gangster-type men. The fashionable dress at the time also reflected the flapper's new lifestyle.
Mods emerged during a time of war and political and social troubles, and stemmed from a group called the modernists. They were young men and women who came from all classes who believed that their fashion choices ""gave them entrée everywhere"" and empowered them. The Mods' style and embrace of modern technology spread from the UK overseas t",science
Masters in Agricultural Economics,"The Master of Economics (MEcon or MEc) 

is  a postgraduate master's degree in economics comprising training in economic theory, econometrics, and/or applied economics.
The degree is also offered as an MS  or MSc, MA or MCom in economics; 
variants are the Master in Economic Sciences (MEconSc), and the Master of Applied Economics.

Structure
The degree may be offered as a terminal degree or as additional preparation for doctoral study, and is sometimes offered as a professional degree, such as the  emerging  MPS in Applied Economics.

The program emphases and curricula will differ correspondingly.  The course of study for the master's degree lasts from one to two years. A thesis is often required, particularly for terminal degrees.
Many universities (in the United States) do not offer the master's degree directly; rather, the degree is routinely awarded as a master's degree ""en route"", after completion of a designated phase of the PhD program in economics. 
Entry requirements are undergraduate work in (calculus-based) economics, at least at the ""intermediate"" level, and often as a major, and a sufficient level of mathematical training (including courses in  probability and statistics; often (multivariable) calculus and linear algebra; and sometimes mathematical analysis.)

Curriculum
Typically, the curriculum is structured around core topics, with any optional coursework complementary to the program focus. The core modules are usually in microeconomic theory, macroeconomic theory and econometrics. 
At this level, the topics covered are microfoundations and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, and allow for heterogeneity, relaxing the idea of a representative agent.
Sometimes, topics from heterodox economics are introduced.
Econometrics extends the undergraduate domain to multiple linear regression and multivariate time series,  
and introduces simultaneous equation methods and generalized linear models.
Game theory and computational economics are often included.
Some (doctoral) programs include core work in economic history.
Theory-focused degrees will tend to cover these core topics more mathematically, and emphasize econometric theory as opposed to econometric techniques and software; these will also require a separate course in mathematical economics. 
Note though that regardless of focus, most programs ""now place a marked emphasis on the primacy of mathematics"", and many universities thus also require ""Quantitative Techniques for Economics"", 
or ""Math for Economics""  especially where mathematical economics is not a core course. 
The optional or additional coursework will depend on the program's emphasis. 
In theory-focused degrees, and those preparing students for doctoral work, this coursework is often in these same core topics, but in greater depth. 
In terminal or applied or career-focused degrees, options may include public finance, labour-, financial-, development-, industrial-,  health- or agricultural economics.

Australian Surf Life Saving Championships,"The Australian Surf Life Saving Championships  known as The Aussies is the national Surf lifesaving championships for Australia. It is the largest surf lifesaving event in Australia and the largest event of its kind in the world. It is organised by Surf Life Saving Australia, and had been held annually since 1915.
The first Australian Surf Life Saving Championships were held at Bondi Beach, New South Wales in March 1915.
The first Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) Masters Championships took place in 1987. It has since become an annual event, providing a platform for experienced surf life savers to showcase their skills and compete at a high level.

List of Ironman and Ironwoman Champions
Held at the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships every year, the Australian Ironman and Ironwoman Title is awarded to the winners of these events. The format is the same as for typical surf carnivals, a 10-to-20-minute race with a field of 150 competitors, which over several rounds of will be reduced to a final of 16 athletes. These are the blue ribbon events the Championships, and also the ones that attracts the most attention in terms of television and spectators on the beach. The events are typically the last events on the program, raced on a final day of competition.

Janssen COVID-19 vaccine,"The Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine, (Ad26.COV2.S) sold under the brand name Jcovden, is a COVID‑19 vaccine that was developed by Janssen Vaccines in Leiden, Netherlands, and its Belgian parent company Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of American company Johnson & Johnson.
It is a viral vector vaccine based on a human adenovirus that has been modified to contain the gene for making the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID‑19. The body's immune system responds to this spike protein to produce antibodies. The vaccine requires only one dose and does not need to be stored frozen.
Clinical trials for the vaccine were started in June 2020, with phase III involving around 43,000 people. In January 2021, Janssen announced that 28 days after a completed vaccination, the vaccine was 66% effective in a one-dose regimen in preventing symptomatic COVID‑19, with an 85% efficacy in preventing severe COVID‑19 and 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization or death caused by the disease.
The vaccine has been granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a conditional marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. In June 2023, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization for the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at the request of its manufacturer.
Because cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported after receipt of the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends ""preferential use of mRNA COVID‑19 vaccines over the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine, including both primary and booster doses administered to prevent COVID‑19, for all persons aged 18 years of age and older. The Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine may be considered in some situations, including for persons with a contraindication to receipt of mRNA COVID‑19 vaccines."" In February 2022, Johnson & Johnson announced it has temporarily suspended production of the vaccine though they also noted that it will likely resume at some point in the future and that it will honor all pre-existing contracts that oblige Janssen to supply its vaccine by using the millions of already existing vaccine doses in its inventory where requested.

Medical uses
The Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine is used to provide protection against infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in order to prevent COVID‑19 in people aged eighteen years and older.
The vaccine is given by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. The initial course consists of a single dose.
There is no evidence that a second booster dose is needed to prevent severe disease in healthy adults. In October 2021, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began recommending a booster dose.

Efficacy
A vaccine is generally considered effective if the estimate is ≥50% with a >30% lower limit of the 95% confidence interval. Efficacy is closely relat",medicine
Falling number,"The falling number (FN), also referred to as the Hagberg number or Hagberg–Perten number, is the internationally standardized (ICC 107/1, ISO 3093-2004, AACC 56-81B) and most popular method for determining sprout damage. With the falling number test, so-called weather- or sprout-damaged wheat or rye, which adversely affects bread-making quality, could be detected at the grain silo intake within a few minutes.
Sprouting, or pre-harvest germination, is caused by damp or rainy weather conditions during the final stage of maturation of the crop. The germination causes an accelerated production of the starch-degrading enzyme alpha-amylase. Severely sprouted grain kernels can contain several thousand times the amount of enzyme of sound un-sprouted kernels. Because of this, very low levels of severely sprouted kernels mixed into sound wheat can cause the entire lot to exhibit significant amylase activity. Since its introduction in the early 1960s, the FN test has become a world standard in the grain and flour milling industries for measuring alpha-amylase activity in wheat, durum wheat, triticale, rye and barley, as well as milled products made from these grains.

History
The falling number method was developed at the end of the 1950s by Sven Hagberg and his co-worker Harald Perten, both at the Cereal Laboratory of the Swedish Institute for the Crafts and Industries.

Method description
The falling number method is uncomplicated, but requires an apparatus which follows the international standards. Such an apparatus consists of a water bath, a test tube, a stirring rod, and a stirring device. The test was performed manually when first employed, test instrumentation today is mostly automated.

Flour samples can be analyzed directly. Grain samples are ground to a powder.
The sample is put into the test tube, distilled water is added, and the tube is shaken vigorously to achieve a homogeneous mix
The tube is placed in the boiling water bath, and the sample is stirred. The starch begins to gelatinize and the slurry becomes more viscous. The mixing ensures the gelatinization is homogeneous in the slurry, crucial for consistent test results. An additional effect of the high temperature is that the alpha-amylase enzyme contained in the grain begins to break the starch down into glucose and maltose, thereby reducing the viscosity of the slurry. The amount of starch break-down is directly proportionate to the alpha-amylase activity, meaning that the higher the activity of the alpha-amylase, the lower the viscosity will be.
After 60 seconds of mixing, the stirrer is dropped from the top of the test tube, and the time it takes to reach the bottom is measured. That time, measured in seconds, is the falling number.
The speed at which the stirrer falls is determined by the viscosity of the slurry. Samples with more sprouted grain have greater alpha-amylase activity, which will result in a less viscous slurry and a smaller falling number. Samples with less alpha-amylas",economics
Bloc party,"A bloc party (German: Blockpartei), sometimes called a satellite party, is a political party that is a constituent member of an electoral bloc. However, the term also has a more specific meaning, referring to non-ruling but legal political parties in a one-party state (most notably communist states as auxiliary parties and members of a ruling coalition, differing such governments from pure one-party states such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union) although such minor parties rarely if ever constitute opposition parties or alternative sources of power. Other authoritarian regimes may also have multiple political parties which are nominally independent in order to give the appearance of political pluralism, but support or act in de facto cooperation with the government or ruling party.

Background
The concept has its roots in the popular front idea where Marxist and non-Marxist political parties and other organisations would belong in an umbrella organisation. Following the end of World War II, elections were held in areas already under Soviet influence who would become members of the Eastern Bloc, that while giving voters a choice would be seen as a step towards a totalitarian, Communist-led regime. Bloc parties were able to retain their non-Marxist orientation, but in practice were always subordinate to the ruling Communist party, and were required to accept the Communists' ""leading role"" as a condition of their continued existence. All legal parties and civic organisations were required to be members of the official Communist-dominated coalition. Elections were not competitive as the composition of legislatures was generally pre-determined.
Parties only occasionally dissented from the line of the ruling party. Some parties were pre-existing, others had been newly formed, to appeal to specific sectors of society. However, during the fall of Communism, many hitherto subordinate bloc parties would begin to assert their independence and play a role in the democratisation process, while others would be unable to continue functioning either due to a loss of guaranteed yet artificial representation (granted to them by the ruling Communist Party), or due to the stigma of being associated with subservience to the Communists, and would either dissolve or fade into obscurity.

Bloc parties under Communist regimes
East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Bulgaria operated bloc party systems where non-communist parties were constituent members of an official coalition. A similar system operates in China today.

East Germany
In the German Democratic Republic, the National Front was the umbrella organisation which included the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany, other political parties and various non-party organisations.
Germany was since 1945 divided into four occupation zones. Each occupying power decided which parties it allowed. Four parties were initially allowed in all four zones:

History of Sylhet,"The Greater Sylhet district region predominantly included the Sylhet Division in Bangladesh, and Karimganj district in Assam, India. The history of the Sylhet region begins with the existence of expanded commercial centres in the area that is now Sylhet City. Historically known as Srihatta and Shilhatta, it was ruled by the Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms of Vanga, Harikela and Kamarupa before passing to the control of the Chandra, Sena and Deva dynasties in the early medieval period. Buddhism was prevalent in the first millennium. After the fall of these Buddhist and Hindu principalities, the region became home to many more independent petty kingdoms such as Jaintia, Gour, Laur, and later Taraf, Pratapgarh, Jagannathpur, Chandrapur and Ita. After the Conquest of Sylhet in the 14th century, the region was absorbed into Shamsuddin Firoz Shah's independent principality based in Lakhnauti, Western Bengal. It was then successively ruled by the Muslim sultanates of Delhi and the Bengal Sultanate before collapsing into Muslim petty kingdoms, mostly ruled by Afghan chieftains, after the fall of the Karrani dynasty in 1576. Described as Bengal's Wild East, the Mughals struggled in defeating the chieftains of Sylhet. After the defeat of Khwaja Usman, their most formidable opponent, the area finally came under Mughal rule in 1612. Sylhet emerged as the Mughals' most significant imperial outpost in the east and its importance remained as such throughout the seventeenth century. After the Mughals, the British Empire ruled the region for over 180 years until the independence of Pakistan and India. There was a complete list of the different amils who governed Sylhet which was recorded in the office of the Qanungoh (revenue officers) of Sylhet. However, most complete copies have been lost or destroyed. Dates from letters and seal traces show evidence that the amils were constantly changed. In 1947, when a referendum was held, Sylhet decided to join the Pakistani province of East Bengal. However, when the Radcliffe Line was drawn up, Karimganj district of Barak Valley was given to India by the commission after being pleaded by Abdul Matlib Mazumdar's delegation. Throughout the history of Sylhet, raids and invasions were also common from neighbouring kingdoms as well as tribes such as the Khasis and Kukis.

Ancient
According to historians, Sylhet was an expanded commercial centre inhabited by Brahmans under the realm of the Harikela and Kamarupa kingdoms of ancient Bengal and Assam.
The Hindu epic known as the Mahabharata mentions the marriage of Duryodhana of the Kauravas into a family in Habiganj, Sylhet. The Purana also mentions the hero Arjuna travelling to the Jaintia to regain his horse held captive by a princess. The region is also home to two of the fifty-one body parts of Sati, a form of Durga, that fell on Earth according to accepted legends. Shri Shail and Jayanti are where the neck and left palm of Sati fell and are Shakti Peethas.

Casa-grande,"The casa-grande (Portuguese and Spanish: ""big house"") was the Brazilian equivalent of a Southern plantation in the United States. These casas-grandes were predominantly located in the northeast of Brazil (areas such as present day Bahia and Pernambuco). Additionally, sugar cane was grown in the interior, in the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
The casa-grande was made up of three main components: the Big House, the senzala (slave quarters), and the engenho (sugar cane mill). The Lord of sugar plantation was called the senhor de engenho (""Lord of the sugar plantation""). His word was final, and he had control over the land, the slaves, and the women who made up the plantation community.
The larger casas-grandes were self-sustaining, since they were isolated from the more developed coastal regions. Essential structures that were built included the school, the nursery, the infirmary, the family chapel, the lords’s harem, the bank, and the cemetery. In the early days it was necessary to maintain an army on the plantation. Those armies were sometimes very large, having up to one hundred members drawn from Indigenous or multi-racial residents.
These plantations constituted a largely self-contained economic, social, political, and cultural system.

Master of sugar works
Gilberto Freyre wrote in his book Casa-Grande & Senzala, ""Once the Jesuit was overthrown the senhor de engenho dominated colonial life almost without interference. He was the true master of Brazil, more powerful than viceroys or bishops."" He added, ""The truth is that around these senhores de engenho was created the most stable type of civilization in Hispanic America; and that type of civilization is exemplified by the heavy-set, horizontal architecture of the Big House.""
These land owners were usually very powerful Portuguese men, and they did their best to keep their blood pure. This of course meant heavy inbreeding to keep the aristocracy. Freyre also says in his book that their motto was "" A white woman to marry, a mulatto to take to bed, a Negress to do the work.""
These sugar cane plantations were somewhat similar to the larger Southern plantations in the U.S., being an agricultural industry run on slave labor, which became very powerful in both Brazil and the United States.

Decision theory,"Decision theory or the theory of rational choice is a branch of probability, economics, and analytic philosophy that uses the tools of expected utility and probability to model how individuals would behave rationally under uncertainty. It differs from the cognitive and behavioral sciences in that it is mainly prescriptive and concerned with identifying optimal decisions for a rational agent, rather than describing how people actually make decisions. Despite this, the field is important to the study of real human behavior by social scientists, as it lays the foundations to mathematically model and analyze individuals in fields such as sociology, economics, criminology, cognitive science, moral philosophy and political science.

Branches
Normative decision theory is concerned with identification of optimal decisions where optimality is often determined by considering an ideal decision maker who is able to calculate with perfect accuracy and is in some sense fully rational. The practical application of this prescriptive approach (how people ought to make decisions) is called decision analysis and is aimed at finding tools, methodologies, and software (decision support systems) to help people make better decisions.
In contrast, descriptive decision theory is concerned with describing observed behaviors often under the assumption that those making decisions are behaving under some consistent rules. These rules may, for instance, have a procedural framework (e.g. Amos Tversky's elimination by aspects model) or an axiomatic framework (e.g. stochastic transitivity axioms), reconciling the Von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms with behavioral violations of the expected utility hypothesis, or they may explicitly give a functional form for time-inconsistent utility functions (e.g. Laibson's quasi-hyperbolic discounting).
Prescriptive decision theory is concerned with predictions about behavior that positive decision theory produces to allow for further tests of the kind of decision-making that occurs in practice. In recent decades, there has also been increasing interest in ""behavioral decision theory"", contributing to a re-evaluation of what useful decision-making requires.

Types of decisions
Choice under uncertainty
The area of choice under uncertainty represents the heart of decision theory. Known from the 17th century (Blaise Pascal invoked it in his famous wager, which is contained in his Pensées, published in 1670), the idea of expected value is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an ""expected value"", or the average expectation for an outcome; the action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value. In 1738, Daniel Bernou",science
Flying disc freestyle,"Flying disc freestyle, also known as freestyle Frisbee in reference to the trademarked brand name, is a sport and performing art characterized by creative, acrobatic, and athletic maneuvers with a flying disc. Freestyle is performed individually or more commonly in groups, both competitively and recreationally.
The Freestyle Players Association (FPA) is the governing body of freestyle, ""dedicated to the growth of freestyle disc play as a lifetime recreation and competitive sport. The organization is involved in international tournaments and rankings as well as education grants and promotional activities. Every year, the FPA holds a world championship with divisions in Open Pairs, Mixed Pairs, Open Co-op, and Women's Pairs. Competitive freestyle is usually judged on execution, difficulty, and artistic impression by a panel of players.

History
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, modern flying discs had become a popular pastime in the United States, developing into various disciplines such as double disc court, disc guts, ultimate, disc golf, and disc freestyle. At the time, most disc players were overall players, participating in all the various disciplines. Freestyle began in the 1960s with a few players, like Victor Malafronte, John ""Z"" Weyand, Ken Westerfield, Kerry Kollmar and Dan Roddick trying to perform more complex trick catches and throws. Freestyle was introduced as its own competitive discipline, with the first Frisbee freestyle competitions occurring in 1974, at the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships, Toronto, Ontario, and the Vancouver Open Frisbee Championships, Vancouver, BC.
Freestyle in the beginning before the invention of the ""nail delay"" catching possibilities would depend on the throw you were given, it was always spontaneous and unpredictable. Play of this type of freestyle was performed with two players standing 30–40 yards apart, the throws were fast and varied and the catches were right off the throw, except for the occasional kick or slap-up and rarely a pause between the catch and the throw back. At advanced levels, the throws and catches would become a flow that was created once you mastered the basics. It was fast and fluid and visibly would resemble martial arts and dance.
One of the earliest distinctly freestyle disc maneuver was the tip, the act of quickly pressing fingers on the bottom of the disc to maintain or alter its position without catching the disc or letting it fall to the ground. Tipping first began in the early 70s, becoming more popular and refined by 1975. The tip, according to some histories, eventually led to the nail delay, considered by many to be the beginning of modern freestyle.
The invention of the nail delay is disputed, but its first tournament appearance occurred when Freddie Haft performed the delay in the freestyle pairs event at the 1975 American Flying Disc Open (AFDO) in Rochester, NY. This was the first freestyle event held in the US. The nail delay involves balancing the disc on the f",sports

Tejo (sport),"Tejo (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈtexo]) or turmequé (pronounced [tuɾmeˈke]), is a traditional throwing sport in Colombia. It is distinctive for its use of small targets containing gunpowder, which explode on impact.

History
The exact origins of Tejo are uncertain. It is widely accepted that the sport has origins in native aboriginals from central Colombia, where it might have been played in a similar form. This form of tejo used a golden disc called a zepquagosqua, which means ""I play"" in the Chibcha language.

Background
Tejo is a popular sport in Colombia, and some see it as a connection to the pre-Columbian era of the Americas. Only soccer has a larger and more supported industry in Colombia.
In Colombia, it is common to find professional tejo teams around the major cities and smaller towns. A few of the teams are sponsored by local companies or someone that loves tejo. In the past, the playing of tejo was accompanied by chicha (an indigenous maize-based alcoholic beverage), whereas modern tejo players refresh themselves with beer. Tejo has been widely exploited by beer companies in Colombia. Tejo aficionados are trying to change the image of the sport in popular culture from a rowdy bar game to a serious sport with a rich history. There are many people in Colombia who are in disagreement with the use of beer in this sport, and some Colombians want to prohibit alcohol companies sponsoring the game.
Modern tejo competitions are highly organized tournaments. Tournaments, known as ""torneos Relampago,"" are the most common, and are usually played over one weekend by direct elimination of teams. Prizes include trophies, medals, and money. Household items are awarded to finalists in combination with money or coupons. Tejo has no mass media coverage, apart from the National Games, but sponsoring and targeted marketing efforts make it attractive to brands that position themselves as ""popular"".
Tejo has become a popular cultural activity for backpackers travelling Colombia, with a number of hostels throughout the country hosting free tejo nights. Professional tejo teams exist in neighboring countries, including Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. Tejo's following and industry is much less developed outside of Colombia.

Gameplay
The game consists of throwing a metal puck/disc (called a tejo) across a field at a 1-by-1-metre (3.3 by 3.3 ft) board at a distance of approximately 18.5 metres (20.2 yd). The board is covered with clay and set at a 45-degree angle.
Wooden frames covered in clay act as a protective board to keep the tejo from hitting other elements or people in the neighboring area, and are called tablas. Inside the tablas, there is a metal pipe or car spring, designed to cushion the impacts of the tejo. This pipe is the target where the tejo is meant to hit. The pipe is set at the same angle as the frame (45 degrees).
The tejo must be thrown from within the throwing area, and the goal is to impact the inside of the target at the end of the field. A",sports
Modernity,"Modernity, a topic in the humanities and social sciences, is both a historical period (the modern era) and the ensemble of particular socio-cultural norms, attitudes and practices that arose in the wake of the Renaissance—in the Age of Reason of 17th-century thought and the 18th-century Enlightenment. Commentators variously consider the era of modernity to have ended by 1930, with World War II in 1945, or as late as the period falling between the 1980s and 1990s; the following era is often referred to as ""postmodernity"". The term ""contemporary history"" is also used to refer to the post-1945 timeframe, without assigning it to either the modern or postmodern era. (Thus ""modern"" may be used as a name of a particular era in the past, as opposed to meaning ""the current era"".)
Depending on the field, modernity may refer to different time periods or qualities. In historiography, the 16th to 18th centuries are usually described as early modern, while the long 19th century corresponds to modern history proper. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from fashion to modern warfare), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics.
As an analytical concept and normative idea, modernity is closely linked to the ethos of philosophical and aesthetic modernism; political and intellectual currents that intersect with the Enlightenment; and subsequent developments such as existentialism, modern art, the formal establishment of social science, and contemporaneous antithetical developments such as Marxism. It also encompasses the social relations associated with the rise of capitalism, and shifts in attitudes associated with secularization, liberalization, modernization and post-industrial life.

By the late 19th and 20th centuries, modernist art, politics, science and culture has come to dominate not only Western Europe and North America, but almost every populated area on the globe, including movements thought of as opposed to the West and globalization. The modern era is closely associated with the development of individualism, capitalism, urbanization and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political progress. Wars and other perceived problems of this era, many of which come from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against modern development. Optimism and belief in constant progress has been most recently criticized by postmodernism while the dominance of Western Europe and Anglo-America over other continents has been criticized by postcolonial theory.
In the context of art history, modernity (Fr. modernité) has a more limited sense, modern art covering the period of c. 1860–1970. Use of the term in this sense is attributed to Charles Baudelaire, who in his 1863 essay ""The Painter of ",history
Rondine (Arezzo),"Rondine is a small village in the Province of Arezzo, in Tuscany, Italy. It is located 12 km from the town of Arezzo. The settlement dates from the 11th century, when the castle (Castello di Rondine) was built. This castle, since fallen into ruin, is currently undergoing restoration. The Associazione Rondine, which brings together students from areas of conflict in order to promote peace and reconciliation, is based in the village.

History
Up to 1977, the medieval village of Rondine was completely abandoned and destined to fall apart. It was then that the Bishop of Arezzo, Telesforo Cioli, appointed two young families to maintain and restructure the small village. Shortly after, two local communities, the Comunità del Sacro Cuore and the Comunità Giovanile di Saione joined the effort to recover Rondine. In the following years, Rondine slowly grew to become a village that would welcome and assist families in need.
In 1990, Rondine hosted the birth of Associazione Rondine, a cultural association that started acting on a broader scale, including solidarity projects for the newly formed Russian Federation. Soon after, in 1995, following the eruption of the First Chechnya War, long negotiations were met with a ceasefire. At this point, Rondine decided to accept five students from Chechnya, and five from Russia, to live together and meet “the person behind the enemy”. This initial encounter between students originating from both sides of a military conflict is what sparked the idea behind the foundation of l’Associazione Cittadella della Pace. The foundation of this Association in 1997, allowed Rondine to expand with its Studentato Internationale di Rondine (Rondine's International Student Residence Hall). This initiative was later amplified to adopt “rivals” from nations in conflict such as: Abkhazia, Ingushetia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Romania, Israel, Palestine, South Ossetia, Sierra Leone, North Macedonia, and Lebanon.

Mission
“Promoting conflict resolution through the experiences of young people who are able to uncover a real person within their enemy.”
With this mission in mind, the Association uses the International Residence Hall to allow students coming from different conflicting nations to live together and gradually starting to promote dialogue and a peaceful coexistence between their nations. Throughout their time at Rondine, students have the opportunity of completing undergraduate or postgraduate courses in nearby Universities, so that with their return home as potential future leaders, they may use their open mentality to advocate for peace in their respective countries.

Cyber Security and Resilience Bill,"On July 17th 2024, it was announced at the  State Opening of Parliament
that the  Labour government will introduce the Cyber Security and Resilience Bill (CS&R). The proposed legislation is intended to update the existing Network and Information Security Regulations 2018, known as UK NIS. CS&R will strengthen the UK's  cyber defences and  resilience to hostile attacks thus ensuring that the infrastructure and critical services relied upon by  UK companies are protected by addressing  vulnerabilities, while ensuring the digital economy can deliver  growth.
The legislation will expand the remit of the existing regulations and put regulators on a stronger footing, as well as increasing the reporting requirements placed on businesses to help build a better picture of cyber threats. Its aim is to strengthen UK cyber defences, ensuring that the critical infrastructure and digital services which companies rely on are secure. The Bill will extend and apply UK-wide.
The new laws are part of the Government's pledge to enhance and strengthen UK cyber security measures and protect the digital economy. CS&R will introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to enforce stringent cyber security measures across various sectors. This framework will include mandatory compliance with established cyber security standards and practices to ensure essential cyber safety measures are being implemented. Ultimately, businesses will need to demonstrate their adherence to these standards through regular audits and reporting. Also included in the legislation are potential cost recovery mechanisms to provide resources to regulators and provide powers to proactively investigate potential vulnerabilities.

Key facts
The key facts from the King's Speech are:

 i) The current UK NIS cyber security regulations play an essential role in safeguarding the UK’s critical national infrastructure by placing security duties on industry involved in the delivery of essential services. These regulations cover the five sectors of transport, energy, drinking water, health and digital infrastructure, as well as some digital services including online marketplaces, online search engines, and cloud computing services. 12 regulators are responsible for implementing the present regulations.
ii) Hostile cyber actors are increasingly targeting UK critical sectors and supply chains. Recent serious high-profile attacks impacting London hospitals and the  Ministry of Defence, as well as ransomware attacks on the British Library and Royal Mail, have highlighted that UK services and institutions are vulnerable to attack.
iii) The impacts of a cyber attack on these sectors pose severe risks to UK citizens, core services and the economy at large. For example, as a result of the ransomware attack affecting the NHS in England in June [2024], 3,396 outpatient appointments and 1,255 elective procedures were postponed across King's College Hospital, Guy’s Hospital and St Thomas’ Hospital, all in South L",technology
Enchantment (social sciences),"Enchantment is a term widely used to describe something delightful, possibly magical, that causes a feeling of wonder. It has been adapted by a range of scholars across multiple disciplines, especially anthropology and sociology, and then later urban studies, to describe the ways in which people create moments of wonder in the midst of everyday life. British anthropologist Alfred Gell described art as ""the technology of enchantment,"" permitting us to ""see the real world in an enchanted form"". American sociologist George Ritzer uses the term enchantment in his analysis of consumerism and McDonaldization, making the argument that ""enchantment of the consumer is necessary for the spell to work"".

Enchantment engineers
A different strand was developed by Belgian scholar Yves Winkin, who highlighted the element of collusion between ""enchantment engineers"" (the people who create something requiring the willing suspension of disbelief) and visitors to locations where the illusion or wonder has been created to delight them. Enchantment here is about experiencing a moment of unexpected pleasure or happiness, focusing not on times it occurs randomly, but when it results from someone's deliberate efforts. In these cases, enchantment refers to ""places and landscapes created with the intention of inducing a state of euphoria in those who frequent them"". Often people are not actually fooled by an enchantment, rather they choose to set aside their understanding of the everyday in order to participate in fooling themselves, so there is active collusion between engineers and visitors.
Initially the concept of enchantment was assumed to apply to places deliberately constructing illusions, such as Disneyland, historic sites, or carnivals. Creating each of these contexts requires enchantment engineers to make certain design decisions in order to achieve specific responses from visitors. Disneyland has its own enchantment engineers, called ""imagineers"" (Walt Disney Imagineering). Ordinary people thus experience a world which has been deliberately prepared by professionals, a world different from their everyday reality. Many later discussions have described such contexts, including any location that draws tourists, but especially historic sites, including historic buildings and the various ways attention can be drawn to them (as with unique lighting displays).

Enchantment and walking
Enchantment has been applied to walking and pedestrian behavior generally, first to historic walking paths (e.g., the pilgrimage to Compostela), and then more broadly to pedestrian behavior and urban experiences. Most often, the focus has been on places of enchantment located throughout a city. Much of this strand of research emphasizes amenities which are not only functional but aesthetically pleasing. This is a two-part process: someone (the enchantment engineer) has to design something, but then nothing noteworthy happens until other people come along to appreciate it (tourists or vis",science
Centrão,"In Brazilian politics, the Centrão (lit. 'big centre' – Portuguese pronunciation: [se᷉'tɾɐ᷉w᷉]) refers to a group of political parties that do not have a specific or consistent ideological orientation and aim at ensuring proximity to the executive branch in order to guarantee advantages and allow them to distribute privileges through clientelistic networks. Despite its name, the Centrão is not a centrist political group, generally composed of parliamentarians from the ""lower clergy"" and big tent parties, who act according to their own interests, linked to cronyism and logrolling. Over the years, the Centrão has become the political kingmaker in Brazil.

History
The term has its origin in the 1987 Constituent Assembly, being used to designate a group of parties with a center-right profile that united to support then-president José Sarney with the objective of fighting the proposals of Ulysses Guimarães' supporters — accused of being progressive — for the text of the new Constitution. Five parties made up the Centrão at that time: the PFL, PL, PDS, PDC and PTB, as well as parts of the PMDB. The centrist congressmen managed to change the way the text was approved by negotiating support in exchange for positions and benefits. On June 2, 1988, they also managed to approve Sarney's five-year term.
The Centrão would gain prominence again with the formation of the ""blocão"" (big bloc), a group created in 2014 by Eduardo Cunha, then leader of the PMDB, due to the dissatisfaction of the ruling base deputies with President Dilma Rousseff, who paid little attention to political articulation with the parliamentarians. The blocão brought together eight parties (PSC, PP, PROS, PMDB, PTB, PR, and Solidarity), which totaled 242 congressmen (47% of the Chamber). Cunha's influence over this group of deputies would result in his election in first round to the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies in February 2015. The group would become the main political force in the Chamber of Deputies and a grouping for the so-called ""BBB Bench"".
From then on, the Centrão would play a key role in the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, removed from office in May 2016, and in making important decisions for the Michel Temer government. During the impeachment process the group would count on thirteen parties: PP, PR, PSD, PTB, PRB, PSC, PROS, SD, PEN, PTN, PHS, PSL, and AVANTE; all of them, except the SD, were part of the base of support to the Dilma Rousseff government, and most of them had ministers in the PT governments. In Temer's government, on the other hand, the group would act to block the two criminal charges against the president, avoid a probable removal from office, and approve his reforms through bargaining, such as the distribution of positions and promises of ministries, the release of parliamentary amendments, funds and bills, and other benefits.

Dachshund racing,"Dachshund racing, or wiener dog racing, is a popular but controversial sporting event, primarily found in North America. Typical dachshund races are either 25 or 50 yards (23 or 46 m) in length, and are run on various surfaces. Many race tracks across America host these events as fundraising or publicity events, and routinely draw the venues' largest attendance numbers of the year.
In the less formal events, most entrants are not career racers, nor bred for racing. Often, dogs will choose not to run the length of the course and instead visit with other dogs or the owner that released them. Otherwise, dogs will run swiftly to their owner at the finish line, coaxed by food or toys.
The de facto national championship of wiener dog racing is the Wienerschnitzel Wiener Nationals, held in San Diego, California, every December as part of the Holiday Bowl; however, many other events claim national championship status.

History
Dachshund racing was first held in Australia in the 1970s. The early meets featured Whippet, Afghan Hound, and Dachshund racing, purely for fun. The UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine in California holds an annual Doxie Derby as part of the university's Picnic Day event. For over 30 years the races have been a fundraiser for veterinary students. Germantown, Tennessee, a suburb of Memphis, also hosts its own 'Running of the Wienies' for charity. Oktoberfest Zinzinnati includes a Running of the Wieners, with the dogs racing in hotdog costumes.
The sport rose in popularity in North America after a 1993 Miller Lite television commercial that listed odd sports, and continued to grow after the release of Wiener Takes All, a documentary film that chronicles two years of the Wiener Nationals circuit. 
In 2009, the Wiener Dog Nationals in Fort Wayne, Indiana, held its 16th annual Dachshund race. Zeus, the Germanfest champ from 2006 to 2009, is generally recognized as the greatest racing dachshund of all time.
In 2016, the town of Bungendore in New South Wales, Australia held the inaugural Werriwa Wiener Dash to raise funds for Dachshund Rescue Australia. On 29 January 2017, the second Werriwa Wiener Dash was held which set the record for the most number of dachshunds in one place outside of a dog show with 154 dachshunds in attendance.
The sport was introduced to Canada in 2018 with the launch of an annual race at Fort Erie Race Track, which proved a major success for the track.

Criticism
While some compare the sport to English and later American Greyhound racing, others see it as cruel and risky. The Dachshund Club of America opposes dachshund races, because the breed has a genetic predisposition to back injuries.

Examples

Intervention prices,"In agricultural policy, the intervention price is the price at which national intervention agencies in the EU are obliged to purchase any amount of a commodity offered to them regardless of the level of market prices (assuming that these commodities meet designated specifications and quality standards). Thus, the intervention price serves as a floor for market prices. Intervention purchases have constituted one of the principal policy mechanisms regulating EU markets in sugar, cereal grains, butter and skimmed milk powder, and (until 2002) beef.

Eastern Armenia,"Eastern Armenia (Armenian: Արևելյան Հայաստան, Arevelyan Hayastan) refers to the eastern part of the Armenian Highlands, historically home to the Armenian people. Over the centuries, Eastern Armenia was repeatedly contested and partitioned, falling under Persian, Russian, and later Soviet rule before forming the modern Republic of Armenia.
The term has been used to distinguish Eastern and Western Armenia, particularly after the Treaty of Zuhab (1639), which divided Armenian lands between Persia and the Ottoman Empire. Eastern Armenia remained under Persian control until the early 19th century, when it was annexed by the Russian Empire (Treaty of Gulistan, 1813; Treaty of Turkmenchai, 1828). After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, Eastern Armenia became part of the short-lived First Republic of Armenia (1918–1920) before being incorporated into the Soviet Union. Today, it forms the core of the independent Republic of Armenia.

Historical Partitions of Armenia
Eastern Armenia is the eastern part of historical Armenia. The division of Armenia into eastern and western parts occurred four times during the medieval period: in 387, 591, 1555, and 1639.

Eastern Armenia under Sasanian Persia
First Partition
Sasanian Armenia (a vassal state of the Persian Empire from 387, fully annexed in 428) came under Sasanian control after the partition of Armenia between the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires. The division in 387 AD marked the beginning of Persian influence over Eastern Armenia, while the western half remained under Byzantine rule. Initially, the region was ruled by an Armenian Arsacid king under Persian suzerainty, but the Sasanian Empire abolished the Armenian monarchy in 428 and established direct rule through a marzpanate, governed by Persian-appointed marzpans (governors).

Second Partition
Under Sasanian rule, Persia attempted to integrate Armenia into its imperial system by promoting Zoroastrianism, which led to resistance from Armenian nobles and clergy. One of the most defining moments of this struggle was the Battle of Avarayr (451 AD), where Armenian forces, led by Vardan Mamikonian, fought against the Persian army to defend their Christian faith. Though the battle resulted in an Armenian defeat, Persia later recognized Armenia’s right to practice Christianity, securing its religious autonomy despite continued Sasanian control.

Eastern Armenia under Safavid Persia
Third Partition
Iranian Armenia (1502–1813/1828) refers to the period when Eastern Armenia was under Persian rule, specifically the Safavid Empire (1502–1736), the Afsharid Dynasty (1736–1796), and the Qajar Dynasty (1796–1828). The Third Partition of Armenia occurred in 1555, when the Safavid Empire and the Ottoman Empire officially divided Armenian territories under the Treaty of Amasya. As a result, Western Armenia, including Lesser Armenia and the western provinces of Greater Armenia—Aghdznik, Tsopk, Upper Armenia, Turuberan, and Tayk—fell under Ottoman rule, while East",politics
X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology,"X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology or XROMM is a scientific research technique. Scientists use it to create 3D images and videos of moving skeletal systems in living organisms.
In XROMM, radio-opaque bone markers are implanted inside a living organism, which allows the X-ray video system to calculate accurate bone marker coordinates as the organism moves.
XROMM was invented at Brown University.
XROMM can be used to model such movements as birds in flight, humans running, frogs jumping, and a toad swallowing its prey.

Great power,"A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.
While some nations are widely considered to be great powers, there is considerable debate on the exact criteria of great power status. Historically, the status of great powers has been formally recognized in organizations such as the Congress of Vienna of 1814–1815 or the United Nations Security Council, of which permanent members are: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The United Nations Security Council, NATO Quint, the G7, the BRICS, and the Contact Group have all been described as great power concerts.
The term ""great power"" was first used to represent the most important powers in Europe during the post-Napoleonic era. The ""Great Powers"" constituted the ""Concert of Europe"" and claimed the right to joint enforcement of the postwar treaties. The formalization of the division between small powers and great powers came about with the signing of the Treaty of Chaumont in 1814. Since then, the international balance of power has shifted numerous times, most dramatically during World War I and World War II. In literature, alternative terms for great power are often world power or major power.

Characteristics
There are no set or defined characteristics of a great power. These characteristics have often been treated as empirical, self-evident to the assessor. However, this approach has the disadvantage of subjectivity. As a result, there have been attempts to derive some common criteria and to treat these as essential elements of great power status. Danilovic (2002) highlights three central characteristics, which she terms as ""power, spatial, and status dimensions,"" that distinguish major powers from other states. The following section (""Characteristics"") is extracted from her discussion of these three dimensions, including all of the citations.
Early writings on the subject tended to judge states by the realist criterion, as expressed by the historian A. J. P. Taylor when he noted that ""the test of a great power is the test of strength for war."" Later writers have expanded this test, attempting to define power in terms of overall military, economic, and political capacity. Kenneth Waltz, the founder of the neorealist theory of international relations, uses a set of six criteria to determine great power: population and territory, resource endowment, military strength, economic capability, political stability and competence.
John Mearsheimer defines great powers as those that ""have sufficient military assets ",politics
Landesque capital,"Landesque capital is a widespread concept used to understand anthropogenic landscapes that serve important economic, social, and ritual purposes.

Etymology
The concept of landesque capital was first used in academic texts by economist Amartya Sen. It occurred in his 1959 thesis on the choice of techniques of agriculture for “underdeveloped countries”. Sen claimed that previous studies had failed to take into account the implications of such technical investments for non-wage economies with land as a dominant factor of production:

Once land is introduced in our analysis, we have to distinguish between two types of capital goods—those which replace labour (e.g., tractors) and those which replace land (e.g., fertilizers). We may call them, for the sake of brevity, “laboresque” capital and “landesque” capital respectively.... [O]ur experience seems to suggest that while investment in fertilizers,or in irrigation, or in pest control, increases yield per acre considerably (without replacing labor), investment in machines like tractors, threshing machines, etc., is useful mainly in replacing labor (without raising yield per acre).

Keith Reemtsma,"Keith Reemtsma (5 December 1925 – 23 June 2000) was an American transplant surgeon, best known for the cross-species kidney transplantation operation from chimpanzee to human in 1964. With only the early immunosuppressants and no long-term dialysis, the female recipient survived nine months, long enough to return to work.
Reemtsma was brought up on a Navajo reservation in Arizona, eventually moving to Utah and then graduating from Idaho State College in Pocatello in 1945. In the 1960s he was professor of surgery at Tulane University, Louisiana, and he later became chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of Utah.
Reemtsma also developed the intra-aortic balloon pump to bridge the time to heart transplant, and performed early research on pancreatic islet cell transplantation for diabetes mellitus. In 1971, he was appointed chairman of the Department of Surgery at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he was involved in developing a multidisciplinary approach to transplant services, as well as advocating surgical repair and reconstruction as an alternative to radical excision.

Early life and education
Keith Reemtsma was born in Madera, California, on 5 December 1925, to the Presbyterian minister and missionary Henry and Pauline Reemtsma. He had one older sister, Carol, and from 1938 was raised on a Navajo reservation in Arizona when he attended a one-room school house which taught only to eighth grade.
As he progressed in his education, Reemtsma moved from schools in Oklahoma to a Presbyterian boarding school in Mount Pleasant, Utah, where he met his first wife to be, Ann Pierce. He attended Idaho State College as part of the United States Navy V-12 programme, where the federal government funded studies to participating colleges. Here, wearing Navy uniform was mandatory and he would have had to participate in strenuous exercise. He completed his pre-medical studies and graduated in 1945.
Reemtsma subsequently attended the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, graduating in 1949, and was inducted into the Phi Chi medical fraternity.

Early surgical training
Reemtsma trained under paediatric surgeon C. Everett Koop who encouraged him to go to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) (now called NewYork–Presbyterian / Columbia University Medical Center or, simply NYP/Columbia) for his surgical residency, under paediatric thoracic surgeon, George Humphreys.
Following his internship, his early surgical career was interrupted by the Korean War, where he served as a Navy doctor with the United States Marine Corps with surgeon Frank Spencer as part of US Navy Surgical Team, Far East Command.
Returning to New York in 1954, he then completed his residency at CPMC in 1957, following which he moved south to Tulane University. Here, under Oscar Creech, Reemtsma was recruited to help build a cardiac surgery service. However, he turned his attention toward renal transplantation ",medicine
De-extinction,"De-extinction (also known as resurrection biology, or species revivalism) is the process of generating an organism that either resembles or is an extinct species. There are several ways to carry out the process of de-extinction. Cloning is the most widely proposed method, although genome editing and selective breeding have also been considered. Similar techniques have been applied to certain endangered species, in hopes to boost their genetic diversity. The only method of the three that would provide an animal with the same genetic identity is cloning. There are benefits and drawbacks to the process of de-extinction ranging from technological advancements to ethical issues.

Methods
Cloning
Cloning is a commonly suggested method for the potential restoration of an extinct species. It can be done by extracting the nucleus from a preserved cell from the extinct species and swapping it into an egg, without a nucleus, of that species' nearest living relative. The egg can then be inserted into a host from the extinct species' nearest living relative. This method can only be used when a preserved cell is available, meaning it would be most feasible for recently extinct species. Cloning has been used by scientists since the 1950s. One of the most well known clones is Dolly the sheep. Dolly was born in the mid 1990s and lived normally until the abrupt midlife onset of health complications resembling premature aging, that led to her death. Other known cloned animal species include domestic cats, dogs, pigs, and horses.

Genome editing
Genome editing has been rapidly advancing with the help of the CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system. Viral DNA that was injected into the bacterium became incorporated into the bacterial chromosome at specific regions. These regions are called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, otherwise known as CRISPR. Since the viral DNA is within the chromosome, it gets transcribed into RNA. Once this occurs, the Cas9 binds to the RNA. Cas9 can recognise the foreign insert and cleaves it. This discovery was very crucial because now the Cas protein can be viewed as a scissor in the genome editing process.
By using cells from a closely related species to the extinct species, genome editing can play a role in the de-extinction process. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. The result is an animal which is not completely the extinct species, but rather a hybrid of the extinct species and the closely related, non-extinct species. Because it is possible to sequence and assemble the genome of extinct organisms from highly degraded tissues, this technique enables scientists to pursue de-extinction in a wider array of species, including thos",technology
Axial Age,"Axial Age (also Axis Age, from the German Achsenzeit) is a term coined by the German philosopher Karl Jaspers. It refers to broad changes in religious and philosophical thought that occurred in a variety of locations from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.
According to Jaspers, during this period, universalizing modes of thought appeared in Persia, India, China, the Levant, and the Greco-Roman world, in a striking parallel development, without any obvious admixture between these disparate cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged.
The historical validity of the Axial Age is disputed. Some criticisms of Jaspers include the lack of a demonstrable common denominator between the intellectual developments that are supposed to have emerged in unison across ancient Greece, the Levant, India, and China; lack of any radical discontinuity with ""preaxial"" and ""postaxial"" periods; and exclusion of pivotal figures that do not fit the definition (for example, Jesus, Muhammad, and Akhenaten).
Despite these criticisms, the Axial Age continues to be an influential idea, with many scholars accepting that profound changes in religious and philosophical discourse did indeed take place but disagreeing as to the underlying reasons. To quote Robert Bellah and Hans Joas, ""The notion that in significant parts of Eurasia the middle centuries of the first millennium BCE mark a significant transition in human cultural history, and that this period can be referred to as the Axial Age, has become widely, but not universally, accepted.""

Origin of the concept
Jaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte (The Origin and Goal of History), published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron. Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including Victor von Strauß (1859) and Ernst von Lasaulx (1870). He was unaware of the first fully nuanced theory from 1873 by John Stuart Stuart-Glennie, forgotten by Jaspers' time, and which Stuart-Glennie termed ""the moral revolution"". Stuart-Glennie and Jaspers both claimed that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations. Jaspers argued that during the Axial Age, ""the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today.""
Jaspers identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held ",history
History of Central America,"Central America is commonly said to include Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. This definition matches modern political borders. Central America begins geographically in Mexico, at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico's narrowest point, and the former country of Yucatán (1841–1848) was part of Central America. At the other end, before its independence in 1903 Panama was part of South America, as it was a Department of Colombia. At times Belize, a British colony until 1981, where English instead of Spanish is spoken, and where the population is primarily of African origin, has been considered not part of (Spanish-speaking) Central America.Long and narrow, Central America does not have an obvious geographical center. Until the middle of the 20th century there were no roads between the countries, which isolated them from each other, and railroads have never connected them. During colonial times Guatemala was the administrative and religious center; religiously it remains so. However, attempts to create a Central American Political Union, like the European Union, have failed. The countries that joined the EU already had extensive cross-border traffic by train; even today (2021) there is by comparison very little, and none by train.
The countries, furthermore, are more diverse than they appear at first glance. Some (Guatemala) have a large indigenous or Native American population, others (Costa Rica) do not. Some (El Salvador) are focused on their Pacific coast, while in others (Belize, Honduras) the Caribbean or Atlantic coast is more important. Panama and to a lesser extent Guatemala and Costa Rica have both coasts playing a significant role. Some countries have stable governments (Costa Rica), others do not (Nicaragua, El Salvador). Panama is heavily Americanized, uses the US dollar as its currency, has a large industry and source of revenue (the canal), and a sophistication which comes from the ships and people passing through the country and previously the U.S. military installations in the former Canal Zone.

Before European contact
In the pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Maya peoples, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.

Spanish Colonial Era
Central America is composed of seven independent nations: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. After the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, most of the inhabitants of Central America shared a similar history. The exception was the Western Caribbean Zone, which",history
Mobile cloud storage,"Mobile cloud storage is a form of cloud storage that is accessible on mobile devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Mobile cloud storage providers offer services that allow the user to create and organize files, folders, music, and photos, similar to other cloud computing models. Services are used by both individuals and companies. Most cloud file storage providers offer limited free use but charge for additional storage once the free limit is exceeded. These costs are usually charged as a monthly subscription rate and have different rates depending on the amount of storage desired.
In 2018, cloud services revenue was about $182.4 billion and in 2022 it is projected to grow to $331.2 billion. The cloud storage industry was projected to grow 17.2 percent in 2019 (Costello, 2019).

History
The concept of cloud computing trace back to 1960s, when the groundwork for modern internet and network technologies was being laid (Human for humans, 2024). One of the pivotal figures in this early period was J.C.R. Licklider, a visionary computer scientist who worked on ARPANET, the precursor to the internet. Licklider's ideas set the stage for the development of distributed computing systems, which are fundamental to cloud computing. Moving into the 1990s, AT&T introduced PersonaLink Services, a more advanced online platform offering electronic mail and online storage. 
Major turning point in 2006
The launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006 marked a major turning point. AWS introduced Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), which allowed businesses and developers to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. This development was revolutionary, providing scalable, reliable, and low-cost data storage infrastructure that transformed how organizations managed their data.

Applications
Some mobile device manufacturers include mobile cloud storage apps with their product. These apps facilitate synchronization of user files across multiple platforms. Part of the process for setting up new mobile devices frequently includes configuring a cloud storage service to Backup the device's files and information. Apple iOS devices come pre-loaded and configured to use Apple's mobile cloud storage service iCloud.  Google offers a similar feature with the Android operating system by backing up the device using a Google Drive account. The Samsung Galaxy smartphone has partnered with Dropbox, while Microsoft similarly offers Microsoft OneDrive.
Some mobile cloud storage apps are platform-independent. For example, Nasuni's Mobile Access app is available on any Android or iOS device.
Most companies offering Cloud Storage have secure websites to access files allowing use on any device that can browse the Internet.

New Communities,"New Communities was a 5,700-acre (23 km2) land trust and farm collective owned and operated by approximately a dozen black farmers from 1969 to 1985. Once one of the largest-acreage African American-owned properties in the United States, it was situated in Southwest Georgia.

Model for U.S. community land trusts
Instrumental in the forming of the partnership was Slater King (1927–1969), a community leader and Civil Rights activist from Albany. Working with such collective farm activists as Robert Swann and Shimon Gottschalk, several black leaders in Albany, Georgia, patterned the form of the organization after legal documents used by the Jewish National Fund in Israel. Group members traveled to Israel to study how the J.N.F. leases land for various uses.  They chose to include leases for homesteads and cooperative farms. The group bought the 5,000-acre (20 km2) farmland and leased it to members.
The documents evolved to a degree after the 1960s and, as of 2010, there were hundreds of community land trusts in the United States with more being planned. Swann later wrote (along with co-author Susan Witt, in their scholarly essay ""Land: Challenge and Opportunity""): ""The perseverance and foresight of that team in Georgia, motivated by the right of African-American farmers to farm land securely and affordably, initiated the CLT movement in this country [the U.S.].""

Collective's production, financial woes and civil suit settlement with USDA
The group used roadside stands to sell crops, built a roadside smokehouse for the hogs they slaughtered, and a roadside sugarcane mill, to attract customers. They pioneered the raising of Muscadine grapes, putting in 8 acres (32,000 m2) of the crop – now commonly grown in Southwest Georgia. On 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) devoted to row crops, they raised area staples: corn, peanuts and soybeans. Yet in 1981 the region where the farms were located experienced severe drought. According to the findings of federal arbitrators in 2009, unlike similar requests from area farmers that were white, New Communities' application for an emergency loan from the United States Department of Agriculture for an irrigation system was denied with no clear explanation. In 1982, the drought continued and the operation sold lumber for $50,000 to remain viable. The USDA demanded its receipt of these funds as a condition for a loan. In 1983 the agency requested and received the deed to the holdings and provided nothing in return.
In the aftermath of the Pigford v. Glickman class-action discrimination lawsuit, in 2009 New Communities received the largest of thousands of compensation awards from the USDA. It was chief arbitrator Michael Lewis's opinion that the USDA's demand for New Communities' timber proceeds ""smack[ed] of nothing more than a feudal baron demanding additional crops from his serfs."" Lewis found the department's actions discriminatory, awarding the former land holders $12.8 million, of about $1 billion paid out to more than 13,300 ",economics
One Day International,"One Day International (ODI) is a format of cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of fifty overs, with the game lasting up to 7  hours. The World Cup, generally held every four years, is played in this format. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited-overs competition.

The international one-day game is a late-twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. When the first three days of the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white-coloured kits with a red-coloured ball.
In the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket competition, and it introduced many of the features of One Day International cricket that are now commonplace, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. This led not only to Packer's Channel 9 getting the TV rights to cricket in Australia but also led to players worldwide being paid to play, and becoming international professionals, no longer needing jobs outside cricket. Matches played with coloured kits and a white ball became more commonplace over time, and the use of white flannels and a red ball in ODIs ended in 2001.

The International Cricket Council (ICC), international cricket's governing body, maintains the ICC ODI Rankings for teams (see table on the right), batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders.

Rules
In the main the laws of cricket apply, but with each team batting for a fixed number of overs. In the early days of ODI cricket the number of overs varied from 40 to 60 overs per side (or 35 to 40 eight-ball overs), but it has been uniformly fixed at 50 overs since the mid-1990s.
Simply stated, the game works as follows:

An ODI is contested by two teams of 11 players each.
The Captain of the side winning the toss chooses to either bat or bowl (field) first.
The team batting first sets the target score in a single innings. The innings lasts until the batting side is ""all out"" (i.e., 10 of the 11 batting players are ""out"") or all of the first side's allotted overs are completed.
Each bowler is restricted to bowling a maximum of 10 overs (fewer in the case of rain-reduced matches and in any event generally no more than one fifth or 20% of the total overs per innings). Therefore, each team must comprise at least five competent bowlers (either dedicated bowlers",sports
History of Cienfuegos,"Cienfuegos (Latin American Spanish: [sjeɱˈfweɣos]), capital of Cienfuegos Province, is a city on the southern coast of Cuba. It is located about 250 km (160 mi) from Havana and has a population of 178,368 in 2022. Since the late 1960s, Cienfuegos has become one of Cuba's main industrial centers, especially in the energy and sugar sectors. The city is dubbed La Perla del Sur (Pearl of the South). Despite being known as an industrial city of factories and various nuclear/electrical plants, and the name Cienfuegos literally translating to ""one hundred fires"" (cien, ""one hundred""; fuegos, ""fires""), the city actually takes its name from the surname of Asturian-born José Cienfuegos Jovellanos, Captain General of Cuba (1816–19).
Between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the city was settled by many Spaniards, mainly Catalans and Asturians who amassed fortunes as businessmen in different branches, other few of them obtained in the sugar industry, they became rich during their stay in Cuba, and they commissioned many of the most emblematic buildings of Cienfuegos that remain today (See also: Indiano). Other well known residents were the Irish-born John O’Bourke, he had ten children on the island, three of whom were Cuban independence fighters from the Spanish crown, the mestizos Juan O'Bourke y Palacio, Rafael O’Bourke y Borroto, and Don Miguel O’Bourke y Ramos. There were also artistic personalities born in Cuba who have contributed in the cultural history of the city.
In 2005, UNESCO inscribed the Urban Historic Centre of Cienfuegos on the World Heritage List, citing Cienfuegos as the best extant example of early 19th century Spanish Enlightenment implementation in urban planning. The downtown area contains six buildings from 1819–50, 327 buildings from 1851 to 1900, and 1188 buildings from the 20th century.

History
The area where the city lies was identified as Cacicazgo de Jagua by early Spanish conquistadors. It was originally settled by 
Ciboney (Taino) indigenous people. Cacicazgo translates from the Taino language as ""chiefdom"". Cacicazgo de Jagua was therefore the chiefdom of Chief Jagua.
The city was later settled by French immigrants from Bordeaux and Louisiana led by Don Louis de Clouet on 22 April 1819. The settlers named the city Fernandina de Jagua in honor of King Ferdinand VII of Spain and local Ciboneyan-Chief Jagua. The settlement successively became a town (villa) in 1829, renamed for Asturian-born José Cienfuegos Jovellanos, Captain General of Cuba (1816–19), and a city in 1880. Many of the streets in old town reflect French origins in their names: Bouyón, D'Clouet, Hourruitiner, Gacel, and Griffo, for instance.
Cienfuegos port, despite being one of the latest settlements established during the colonial era, soon grew to be a powerful town due to the fertile fields surrounding it and its position on the trade route between Jamaica and South American cities to the southeast and the hinterland provincia",history
Conflict economics,"Conflict economics is a branch of economics that puts the allocation of resources by means of violent fighting, i.e. conflict, into economic models.
In traditional economics, appropriation is a non-violent process that is guaranteed by perfect property rights and their costless enforcement.
Conflict economics sheds a different light on appropriation. It is set in a model of contest between two players. Conflict economics introduces the idea that agents have to decide between production of resources and production of guns, i.e. tools that have the sole purposes of appropriating the resources produced by the other player. Different models are introduced to illustrate various situations that have similarities to real life conflicts.

Resource conflict model
Two parties contest a given resource Z. The player who wins the contest claims the entire resource, not leaving anything for the losing party. The probabilities of winning are determined by each party’s choice of guns.

Guns vs. butter model
In this model, agents face a trade-off between producing themselves and grabbing the output of the other agent. Each party is endowed with a secure resource R. The resource cannot be consumed directly but has to be allocated between producing guns (tools for conflict) or butter (consumption). Again, the probability of winning the contest and grabbing the other output depend on the relative numbers of guns produced.  This model allows testing of different power structures between the players. One of the interesting outcomes is that if one agent has higher productivity, i.e. if he uses one unit of the resource he will gain more butter than his opponent would, he will receive a relatively lower expected pay-off. This is due to the fact that each player will then exploit his or her comparative advantage, with the more productive player producing more butter and the less productive player producing more guns, resulting in a higher chance of winning the conflict thus leading to a higher expected pay-off.

Settlement in the shadow of conflict
Conflict is not the only way that parties can appropriate resources. Depending on the risk preferences of the agents, a simple division of the contested resource according to a settlement can be envisioned. A two-stage game serves to illustrate this. In the first stage, parties make their gun choices. In the second stage, negotiations take place. If the negotiations are successful, the players agree on a division and share the good.
If the negotiations are not successful, conflict ensues with the winning party again taking the whole resource. This two-stage model is especially interesting if one includes the possibility of destruction into the model, i.e. in case of conflict the winner is left with only a part of the contested resource. Parties might prefer settlement over conflict if they have an aversion to uncertainty (outcome of conflict dependent on probabilities) or destruction.
However, in the long term conflict might be",economics
Earmark (politics),"An earmark is a provision inserted into a discretionary spending appropriations bill that directs funds to a specific recipient while circumventing the merit-based or competitive funds allocation process. Earmarks feature in United States Congress spending policy, and they are present in public finance of many other countries as a form of political particularism.

Etymology
""Earmark"" comes from the livestock term, where the ears of domestic animals were cut in specific ways so that farmers could distinguish their stock from others grazing on public land. In particular, the term comes from earmarked hogs where, by analogy, pork-barreled legislation would be doled out among members of the local political machine.

Definitions
In 2006 the Congressional Research Service (CRS) compiled a report on the use of earmarks in thirteen Appropriation Acts from 1994 through 2005 in which they noted that there was ""not a single definition of the term earmark accepted by all practitioners and observers of the appropriations process, nor [was] there a standard earmark practice across all appropriation bills."": 2  It was noted at that time, that while the CRS did not summarize earmarks that they came in two varieties: hard earmarks, or ""hardmarks"", found in legislation, and soft earmarks, or ""softmarks"", found in the text of congressional committee reports. Hard earmarks are legally binding, whereas soft earmarks are not but are customarily acted upon as if they were. The CRS did not aggregate the ""varying definitions"" as the result would be invalid.: 3 : 4 
By 2006, the definition most widely used, developed by the Congressional Research Service, the public policy research arm of the U.S. Congress was,

""Provisions associated with legislation (appropriations or general legislation) that specify certain congressional spending priorities or in revenue bills that apply to a very limited number of individuals or entities. Earmarks may appear in either the legislative text or report language (committee reports accompanying reported bills and joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report).""
According to the federal Office of Management and Budget the term earmark referred to, 

""funds provided by the Congress for projects, programs, or grants where the purported congressional direction (whether in statutory text, report language, or other communication) circumvents otherwise applicable merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process. Earmarks are funds provided by Congress for projects or programs that curtail the ability of the Executive Branch to manage critical aspects of the funds allocation process.""

Egyptian women's participation in the Summer Olympics,"The Summer Olympics were first held in 1896 in Athens, but women were not permitted to participate until the second edition of the Games in 1900 in Paris. In that year, 23 female athletes competed alongside 1,201 male athletes. Seventy-six years after the inaugural Summer Olympics, Egyptian women were on the cusp of participating in the 1972 Summer Olympics for the first time. However, the Egyptian delegation withdrew from the Games prematurely after the Munich incident. As documented in the official report of the Olympic Organizing Committee, Egypt's planned participation included one female athlete alongside 38 male athletes. However, the participation featured no women and was limited to 23 male athletes.
Egyptian women eventually made their Olympic debut 88 years after the Games' inception, during the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. This made Egypt the fourth Arab country to have female participants in the Olympics, after Algeria, Libya, and Syria. Since then, Egyptian women have consistently participated in every Summer Olympics to date.
The number of Egyptian female participants in the Olympics has varied over the years. The first participation in the 1984 Games had the highest number of female athletes (6 athletes) until the 2000 Sydney Games, which saw 15 female athletes. Since then, the number of female athletes has increased in each subsequent Olympics, reaching 34 athletes at the 2012 London Games. This represented the highest proportion of female participation within the Egyptian delegation (31%, with 34 female athletes versus 75 male athletes) since Egyptian women began competing in the Olympics.
Similarly, in terms of sports, the 1984 debut saw Egyptian women competing in most sports (4 sports) until the 2000 Games (9 sports). Since then, the number of sports in which Egyptian women compete has gradually increased, reaching 17 sports in the 2016 Rio Olympics.
From the inaugural participation of Egyptian women in the 1984 Olympics until the conclusion of the 2012 London Games, Egyptian female athletes were unable to secure any medals over 28 years. The closest Egyptian women came to winning a medal was in the 2008 Olympics, where Noha Abd Rabo placed fifth in taekwondo and Abeer Abdelrahman placed fifth in weightlifting. Abeer replicated this achievement at the subsequent Olympics, securing fifth place alongside Nahla Ramadan in distinct weight categories within the weightlifting competition.
On August 10, 2016, Sara Ahmed became the first Egyptian female athlete to win an Olympic medal. Sara Ahmed secured a bronze medal in the 69 kg weightlifting category with a total lift of 255 kg, thereby becoming the first Egyptian woman to win an Olympic medal in over a century of Egyptian participation in the Games.

Defined as ""programs, activities, and services aimed at providing a range of opportunities for school-aged children, including mentoring, recreation, education, training, community service, or supervision in a safe environment,"" youth services are a comprehensive series of strategies, activities, programs and organizations spread across the United States and Canada today. In North America, youth services are generally viewed as more organized and systemized than youth work. The term ""youth services"" is used in international contexts as well.

Activities
Youth services are varied and disparate, often emerging from the needs of their local context or from the mandate of external funding sources. ""Best practices in youth services include the provision of safety, appropriate supervision, supportive relationships, opportunities to belong, positive social norms, support for efficacy and skill building, and integration of community, school, and family efforts.""
Specific activities, projects, programs and organizations within the realm of youth services address a variety of issues. According to Fletcher (2024), they include: 

Prevention
Intervention
Out-of-school time education
Personal identities
Civics and democracy
Culture and society
Rights and freedoms
Youth-specific issues
Public health
Personal health (including mental health)
The economy
Crisis support
Nature and the outdoors
Recreation
The arts
Personal development
Empowerment
Within each of those categories are more specific practices. For instance, the practice of ""youth services librarianship"" ""encompasses all library services to youth (children and young adults, ages zero to eighteen) in school and public library settings."" According to one author, it ""has long been considered the classic success story of American libraries.""

Funding and support
There are various sources of funding for youth services across North America. They include government and philanthropic foundations, as well as corporate and private donors. In the U.S., the current thrust of youth services emphasizes positive youth development. In Contra Costa County, youth services ""receives funding from the California Department of Education, the Contra Costa County Workforce Development Board, Contra Costa County Employment and Human Services, the Department of Rehabilitation, as well as other funding sources.""
In addition to local variations, there has been a wide variety of political, fiscal and public support for youth services throughout time. For instance, the New York City Youth Board existed from 1947 until 1976 ""when most of the program services were redistributed to several other city agencies."" From that dispersion, many activities, projects and services were defunded and forgotten about for several years.

Do No Harm (organization),"Do No Harm is a United States medical and policy advocacy group. The group opposes gender-affirming care for minors and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in medicine and medical education, including race-conscious medical school admissions and other identity-based considerations regarding health care decision-making. Do No Harm lobbies state legislatures to ban gender-affirming care for youth. It argues that efforts to recruit a more diverse group of medical practitioners will result in lower standards of care, and that diversity training within the health care system places politics ahead of care.

History
The group was founded in 2022 by Stanley Goldfarb, a retired kidney specialist and former associate dean of curriculum at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, with funding from Joseph Edelman. The group's initial focus was opposing anti-racism in healthcare education and hiring.
The group was formed to ""[protect] patients and physicians from woke healthcare"", according to an April 2022 press release.
In 2023, the group incorporated a second group, Do No Harm Action, which operates as a lobbying arm.
The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designated it as an anti-LGBT hate group.

Gender-affirming care for minors
According to the Associated Press, the group by 2023 had ""evolved into a significant leader in statehouses seeking to ban gender-affirming care for transgender youths"". It developed model legislation state legislatures could introduce to ban such care; by May 2023 the model legislation had been introduced in Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, and West Virginia.
According to the Associated Press, the model legislation has been criticized for ""using technical medical terminology as political rhetoric to scare people"". According to Columbia University's Jack Drescher, editor of the gender dysphoria section of the American Psychiatric Association's 2022 diagnostic manual update, the model legislation language is ""designed to inflame"".

Medical school and health care diversity
According to Goldfarb, efforts by medical schools to recruit a diverse group of students mean ""we're not going to look for the best and the brightest. We're going to look for people who are just OK to make sure we have the right mixture of ethnic groups in our medical schools.""
In 2023, Do No Harm issued a report titled Racial Concordance in Medicine: The Return of Segregation which found ""no relationship between race or ethnicity concordance and the quality of communication, and inconclusive evidence for patient outcomes."" Racial concordance in medicine refers to matching the races of physicians and patients.

Activism
Rallies
On December 4, 2024, Do No Harm organized a rally to oppose gender-affirming care for minors outside the Supreme Court of the United States during the oral arguments for United States v. Skrmetti, which will determine whether bans on gender-affirming care for minors are constitutional.

Analytics,"Analytics is the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics. It is used for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data, which also falls under and directly relates to the umbrella term, data science. Analytics also entails applying data patterns toward effective decision-making. It can be valuable in areas rich with recorded information; analytics relies on the simultaneous application of statistics, computer programming, and operations research to quantify performance.
Organizations may apply analytics to business data to describe, predict, and improve business performance. Specifically, areas within analytics include descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, and cognitive analytics. Analytics may apply to a variety of fields such as marketing, management, finance, online systems, information security, and software services. Since analytics can require extensive computation (see big data), the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the most current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics. According to International Data Corporation, global spending on big data and business analytics (BDA) solutions is estimated to reach $215.7 billion in 2021. As per Gartner, the overall analytic platforms software market grew by $25.5 billion in 2020.

Analytics vs analysis
Data analysis focuses on the process of examining past data through business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling and evaluation, and deployment. It is a subset of data analytics, which takes multiple data analysis processes to focus on why an event happened and what may happen in the future based on the previous data. Data analytics is used to formulate larger organizational decisions. 
Data analytics is a multidisciplinary field. There is extensive use of computer skills, mathematics, statistics, the use of descriptive techniques and predictive models to gain valuable knowledge from data through analytics. There is increasing use of the term advanced analytics, typically used to describe the technical aspects of analytics, especially in the emerging fields such as the use of machine learning techniques like neural networks, decision trees, logistic regression, linear to multiple regression analysis, and classification to do predictive modeling. It also includes unsupervised machine learning techniques like cluster analysis, principal component analysis, segmentation profile analysis and association analysis.

Applications
Marketing optimization
Marketing organizations use analytics to determine the outcomes of campaigns or efforts, and to guide decisions for investment and consumer targeting. Demographic studies, customer segmentation, conjoint analysis and other techniques allow marketers to use large amounts of consumer purchase, survey and panel data to understand and communicate marketing strategy.

Concession (politics),"In politics, a concession is the act of a losing candidate publicly yielding to a winning candidate after an election after the overall result of the vote has become clear. A concession speech is usually made after an election.

United States
History
The first time in the United States that a candidate lost a presidential election and privately conceded was Federalist John Adams to Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson in 1800. In 1860, Northern Democrat Stephen Douglas conceded to Republican Abraham Lincoln with the words: 'Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr. President, and God bless you.' However, during the country's first century, a public concession was the exception rather than the rule.
The first ""concession telegram"" occurred when William Jennings Bryan sent William McKinley a message two days after the 1896 US presidential election. Prior to that election, results took many days to be processed and made public, and thus candidates maintained an air of detachment from the process. The telegram was rather brief and read as follows:

Lincoln, Neb., November 5.
Hon. Wm. McKinley, Canton, Ohio: Senator Jones has just informed me that the returns indicate your election, and I hasten to extend my congratulations. We have submitted the issue to the American people and their will is law.

W.J. Bryan
Over time, concession speeches were introduced aimed at the electorate, especially one's own supporters. These were first broadcast on the radio by Al Smith in 1928, on a newsreel by Wendell Willkie in 1940, and on live television by Adlai Stevenson II in 1952.  In the period between the 1896 and 2016 presidential elections, there had been 32 concessions speeches by major party candidates over the course of 120 years.

Template
In modern U.S. elections (presidential or otherwise), a concession is usually a two-step process: first, the losing candidate makes a concession phone call to the winning candidate and congratulates them personally. Second, the losing candidate makes a televised public speech, known as a concession speech, to their supporters, on an (improvised) podium surrounded by the candidate for the vice presidency, their spouses or other important relatives and friends. The concession speech consists of four elements:

The statement of defeat: an admission that the candidate has lost the election to their opponent, who is congratulated on their victory.
The call to unite: an expression of support for the victor's upcoming term in office, and a call for unity under their leadership, necessary after an often divisive and polarizing election campaign.
The celebration of democracy: a reflection on why democracy and the participation of millions of voters in the electoral process is important, and that their choice should be respected.
The vow to continue the fight: a reminder of the importance of the issues the candidate has raised during the campaign, and the policies their party advocates for. The candidate says th",politics
Age of Enlightenment,"The Age of Enlightenment (also the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment) was an intellectual and philosophical movement taking place in Europe from the late 17th century to the early 19th century. The Enlightenment, which valued knowledge gained through rationalism and empiricism, was concerned with a range of social ideas and political ideals such as natural law, liberty, and progress, toleration and fraternity, constitutional government, and the formal separation of church and state.
The Enlightenment was preceded by and overlapped the Scientific Revolution, which included the work of Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Francis Bacon, Pierre Gassendi, Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton, among others, as well as the rationalist philosophy of Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and John Locke. The dating of the period of the beginning of the Enlightenment can be attributed to the publication of René Descartes' Discourse on the Method in 1637, with his method of systematically disbelieving everything unless there was a well-founded reason for accepting it, and featuring his famous dictum, Cogito, ergo sum (""I think, therefore I am""). Others cite the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica (1687) as the culmination of the Scientific Revolution and the beginning of the Enlightenment. European historians traditionally dated its beginning with the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715 and its end with the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Many historians now date the end of the Enlightenment as the start of the 19th century, with the latest proposed year being the death of Immanuel Kant in 1804.
Philosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffeehouses and in printed books, journals, and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and religious officials and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism, socialism, and neoclassicism, trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment.  Scientific racism also has a background in this period.
The Enlightenment was marked by an increasing awareness of the relationship between the mind and the everyday media of the world, and by an emphasis on the scientific method and reductionism, along with increased questioning of religious dogma — an attitude captured by Kant's essay Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?, where the phrase sapere aude ('dare to know') can be found.
The central doctrines of the Enlightenment were individual liberty, representative government, the rule of law, and religious freedom, in contrast to an absolute monarchy or single party state and the religious persecution of faiths other than those formally established and often controlled outright by the State. By contrast, other intellectual currents included arguments in favour of",history

Digital signal processing and machine learning,"Digital signal processing and machine learning are two technologies that are often combined.

Background
Digital signal processing
Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. The digital signals processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable in a domain such as time, space, or frequency. In digital electronics, a digital signal is represented as a pulse train, which is typically generated by the switching of a transistor. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) has experienced considerable advancements over recent decades, largely due to innovations in digital computing and integrated circuit technology.
Approximately thirty years ago, digital computers and their hardware were typically large, expensive, and primarily utilized for general-purpose applications in scientific and business contexts, often without real-time processing capabilities. The progression from medium-scale integration (MSI) to large-scale integration (LSI) and eventually to very-large-scale integration (VLSI) has facilitated the development of smaller, faster, and more cost-effective digital computers, along with specialized DSP hardware. These advancements in digital circuits now enable the design of highly capable digital systems, allowing the execution of complex DSP tasks that were once impractical or prohibitively expensive to manage with analog systems.
Consequently, many signal processing tasks that were traditionally performed using analog methods are now efficiently handled by digital hardware, offering significant advantages in terms of cost, reliability, and flexibility. This transition from analog to digital processing has expanded the range of DSP applications and enhanced performance capabilities across various fields, including telecommunications, medical imaging, and audio processing.

Machine learning
Machine learning is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Quick progress in the field of deep learning, beginning in 2010s, allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in performance. Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), enables computers and computer-controlled systems to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior, such as pattern recognition, data interpretation, and decision-making. It allows computers to address complex problems where establishing traditional, rule-based models would be inefficient or impractical.
Machine learning employs various techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, to enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or classifications without being explicitly programmed with the mod",technology

Décapole,"The Décapole (French pronunciation: [dekapɔl] ; German: Zehnstädtebund [ˈtseːnʃtɛːtəˌbʊnt], Dekapolis or Dekapole) was an alliance formed in 1354 by ten Imperial cities of the Holy Roman Empire in the Alsace region to maintain their rights. It was disbanded in 1679.
In 1354 Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg ratified the treaty uniting the towns of Haguenau, Colmar, Wissembourg, Turckheim, Obernai, Kaysersberg, Rosheim, Munster, Sélestat and Mulhouse. Hagenau became its capital while the Imperial city of Strasbourg, though venue of the league's diets, remained outside the alliance. The town of Seltz joined the league when it received immediate status in 1357, but had to leave it after its mediatization to the Electorate of the Palatinate in 1414.
The affiliation at first discontinued after Charles' death in 1378, it was, however, re-established in the next year. The ten cities joined the Upper Rhenish Circle in 1500. In 1515, Mulhouse pulled out of the alliance in order to associate with the Old Swiss Confederacy. It was replaced in 1521 by the city of Landau in northern Alsace.
The alliance was strongly shaken by the Thirty Years' War which ravaged the region, allowing Louis XIV of France to conquer the cities according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. The signing of the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1679 finally brought an end to the Décapole, when Alsace was annexed by France. Mulhouse remained an independent city and exclave of the Swiss Confederation until in 1798 it was annexed to the French First Republic. Landau together with the Palatinate was given to Bavaria after the 1815 Congress of Vienna.

Touch Aussie Rules,"Variations of Australian rules football are games or activities based on or similar to the game of Australian rules football, in which the player uses common Australian rules football skills.  They range in player numbers from 2 (in the case of kick-to-kick) up to the minimum 38 required for a full Australian rules football.
Some are essentially identical to Australian rules football, with only minor rule changes, while others are more distant and arguably not simple variations but distinct games.  Others still have adapted to the unavailability of full-sized cricket fields. Other variations include children's games, contests or activities intended to help the player practice or reinforce skills, which may or may not have a competitive aspect.
Most of the variations are played in informal settings, without the presence of umpires and sometimes without strict adherence to official game rules.

Participatory varieties
Auskick
Auskick is a program developed in Australia in the 1980s and promote participation in Australian rules football amongst children, particularly of primary school age and under. It has proven to be popular with both boys and girls. At its peak in the mid-1990s there were around 200,000 Auskick participants annually. The program is now run throughout the world, including several locally branded variations such as: ""Kiwi Kick"" (AFL New Zealand), ""Niukick"" (Papua New Guinea), ""Footy Wild"" (South Africa), ""Bula Kick"" (Fiji), ""Viking Kick"" (Denmark) and ""Ausball"" (United States) among others.
Auskick has its roots in the Little League which began to be played at half time during VFL matches in the 1960s and was revised in 1980 to make it more accessible. Little League was expanded by Ray Allsop into a state development program called Vickick begun in Victoria in 1985. Urged by former player David Parkin in 1995 as a means of keeping the sport viable long term in the Australian Capital Territory it was adopted by the AFL Commission the national governing body for the sport, which began to roll it out nationally from 1998. Numerous professional players are graduates of the Auskick program.

Women's Australian rules football
Women's Australian rules football is a fast-growing variation played by all-female teams that dates back to the 1910s. Since 2010, it has also been governed by the AFL Commission. Its highest levels of competition are the professional AFL Women's club competition in Australia and the Australian Football International Cup (women's division) worldwide representative competition. 
The women's game is also a contact sport, however over the course of its history it is sometimes played with modified rules including different player numbers (16 a side + 5 interchange), a smaller ball, and increased tackling restrictions.

Racketlon,"Racketlon is a combination sport in which competitors play a sequence of the four most popular racket sports: table tennis, badminton, squash, and tennis. It originated in Finland and Sweden and was modeled on other combination sports like the triathlon and decathlon.

Rules
In racketlon a player competes against an opponent, or a doubles pair, in each of the four biggest racket sports: table tennis, badminton, squash and tennis.
One set is played in each sport, in the order from the smallest to the biggest racket. Each of the four sets are played with running score to 21 points, with a margin of two points needed to finish a set. In team competitions, however, the individual matches are played to 11 points.
Each player serves two serves at a time, and except in table tennis, this is always one serve from the right side, and one serve from the left side of the court. Lots are drawn to decide who starts serving in table tennis, and this player will also start serving in squash.
The winner of a racketlon match is the player or doubles pair who has won the most points in total. When a player leads a match with more points than there are points left for the opponent to obtain, the match is over.
If the score is tied after all four sports, a ""gummiarm""-point is played. This is a single extra point played in tennis, with only one serve to start off the rally. Lots are drawn to decide the server, and the winner of this rally wins the entire match.
In doubles, the squash set is played individually. One player from each pair plays until someone reaches 11 points. From here, the rest of the game is finished by the two remaining players.
With the exception of the above-mentioned rules, all rules that apply to the four individual sports also apply for racketlon.

Tournaments
The first official world championship was held on 2001, between Finland and Sweden.
As of June 2016, the International World Tour contains 23 events divided into six challengers, 12 International World Tour tournaments, two Super World Tour tournaments and three World Championships (singles, doubles and national teams).

Instituto de Economia Agrícola,"The Instituto de Economia Agrícola (IEA - Agricultural Economics Institute), linked to the Agência Paulista de Tecnologia dos Agronegócios (APTA) is a major public scientific research institute on economics and statistics applied to agricultural and farming questions, established in São Paulo, Brazil. The aim to provide technical information to support agribusiness decision makers and governmental policies.
IEA was generated in the bosom of Dept. of Vegetable Production (DVP), created within Secretaria de Agricultura e Abastecimento in 1942. During a period to deepen his knowledge of fiber technology area, Agronomical Engineer Dr. Rui Miller Paiva became acquainted with the agricultural economy area and decided to follow that the discipline. Returning to São Paulo, Paiva brought with him ideas and the knowledge that led to the creation of the Rural Studies Commission, DPV's antecessor, the first Brazilian pole on economic issues related to agriculture.
IEA's pioneering spirit continued for over 65 years. As early as the end of 1970, for example, researchers from that Institute would carry out assessments about the energetic balance of crops (today the concept is widely used in the discussions on bioenergy) and the effect of the expansion of sugar cane crop on soil use in the São Paulo (replacement of crops). In the latest years, its involvement with techno-science (nanotechnology) and its social and economical effects within agriculture are the highlight.
IEA is a pioneer in probability sampling in order to forecast harvests, price surveys and the calculation of the market basket. Currently, it calculates and disseminates agricultural prices every four weeks, or the countryside inflation. The agriculture prices are a reference for the markets, wholesales, retailers and producers, both on a state and national level.
IEA's statistical surveys (prices, production, estimates for harvests, labor market, land market) provided a model for other agriculture economics institutions. IEA introduced the MIT methodology (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), as well as the World Bank's, for the conception and economical assessment of agriculture development projects. The economical, prognostics, and the production costs analyses, the census of São Paulo agriculture and the cattle raising census, and the technical and scientific magazines have proved to be important information sources for decision-making on public and private policies.
The Institute takes part in the formulation of public policies concerning the financing of Fundo de Expansão do Agronegócio Paulista (FEAP) in addition to contributing to the analyses of the support financing for small-scale agri-industry. Its surveys are used as a basis for choosing the municipalities to be benefited by the subsidy projects for the State's awarding of rural insurance.

Urinary anti-infective agent,"Urinary anti-infective agent, also known as urinary antiseptic, is medication that can eliminate microorganisms causing urinary tract infection (UTI). UTI can be categorized into two primary types: cystitis, which refers to lower urinary tract or bladder infection, and pyelonephritis, which indicates upper urinary tract or kidney infection.
Escherichia coli (E. Coli) is the predominant microbial trigger of UTIs, accounting for 75% to 95% of reported cases. Other pathogens such as Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus can also cause UTIs.
The use of antimicrobial therapy to treat UTIs started in the 20th century. Nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), fosfomycin, and pivmecillinam are currently the first-line agents for empiric therapy of simple cystitis. On the other hand, the choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy for pyelonephritis depends on the severity of illness, specific host factors, and the presence of resistant bacteria. Ceftriaxone is often considered for parenteral treatment, while oral or parenteral fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, are suitable alternatives for treating pyelonephritis.
Antimicrobial therapy should be tailored to the individual, considering factors like the severity of illness, specific host factors, and pathogen resistance in the local community.

Types of urinary anti-infective agent
Urinary antiseptics are medications that target bacteria in the urinary tract. They can be divided into two groups: bactericidal agents, and bacteriostatic agents. These antiseptics help prevent infections by effectively eliminating UTI symptoms through their action on microorganisms.

Urinary bactericidal agents
Nitrofurantoin
Nitrofurantoin is regarded as the first-line agent for simple cystitis, with an efficacy rate ranging from 88% to 92%. It can also be a prophylactic agent to prevent long-term UTIs. This antibacterial medication is effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Nitrofurantoin exhibits its bactericidal activity through various mechanisms, including inhibiting ribosomal translation, causing bacterial DNA damage and interfering with the citric acid cycle. However, the specific role of each mechanism remains to be further explored.
When nitrofurantoin is metabolized, it converts into a reactive intermediate that attacks bacterial ribosomes, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. This medication is typically taken orally and has minimal systemic absorption, reducing potential side effects. Common adverse reactions associated with nitrofurantoin include brown urine discoloration, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, rash, and peripheral neuropathy.

Fosfomycin
Fosfomycin is a phosphonic acid bactericidal agent. It is commonly used as the first-line treatment for acute simple cystitis, demonstrating a 91% cure rate. It is administered orally as a single dose; In more complicated UTIs, the dose is adjusted to be repeated ev",medicine
Musicians' Medicine,"Musicians' medicine deals with physical and mental issues suffered by musicians ('Musicians' illnesses').
It is sometimes also referred to as Music Medicine, which also describes different forms of music therapy. The related field of music physiology consists of research of physiological foundations of making music as well as the prevention of common health problems in musicians. The term Musicians' Health, often used as a synonym for Musicians' Medicine, generally refers to the health maintenance and wellbeing of musicians, as well as preventive measures, such as sufficient and appropriate exercise, a healthy diet, and enough sleep.
The studies also include mental health problems, for instance stage fright.

Research and Science
As early as 1832, Karl Sundelin published his Medical Guidebook for Musicians. Later, around the turn of the century, Adolf Steinhausen (1859–1910) published multiple tracts on music medicine. Then, in the 1920s, Julius Flesch wrote about Berufskrankheiten des Musikers (Occupational Diseases of the Musician) (Celle, 1925). The neurologist Kurt Singer published his book Berufskrankheiten der Musiker (Occupational diseases of musicians). From 1923, Singer taught at the Hochschule für Musik Hanns Eisler Berlin. The Kurt-Singer-Institute for Music Physiology and Musicians’ Health in Berlin (Academy of Arts and Hochschule für Musik Hans Eisler), currently headed by Alexander Schmidt, was named after him. Further institutions for Musicians' Medicine are the Institute of Music Physiology and Musicians' Medicine at the Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media, founded by Christoph Wagner in 1974 and headed by Eckart Altenmüller since 1994, as well as the Freiburg Institute for Musicians’ Medicine, founded in 2005 and headed by Claudia Spahn and Bernhard Richter. In the former GDR, the field was studied at the Occupational Health Clinic of theatres and orchestras in Berlin. 
Further institutes and departments for Music Physiology and Musicians' Medicine are located at the Universities of Music in Weimar, Leipzig, Dresden and Frankfurt, as well as the Düsseldorf University Hospital and the Rechts der Isar Hospital in Munich.
In 1994, the German Society for Music Physiology and Musicians' Medicine was founded and holds annual conferences. Similar associations have been established in Switzerland, Austria, France, the UK, the Netherlands, the US and New Zealand since the 1990s.

Common health problems
The most common problems are related to overstressing particular muscles, tendons and joints, especially the arms and hands. Of the 264,000 professional musicians working in the US in 2006, 50-76% (depending on the instrument) suffered work-related muscoskeletal ailments.

Vestibular paroxysmia,"Vestibular paroxysmia (VP) is a rare vertigo syndrome, which is defined by recurring, short-lasting vertigo attacks. A neurovascular cross-compression is commonly assumed to cause these attacks.

Signs and symptoms
The main symptoms of VP are short attacks lasting seconds to a few minutes with spinning or swaying vertigo, which typically occur dozens of times a day. This may be accompanied by rhythmic tinnitus. In some patients, the attacks can be triggered by certain head positions or by hyperventilation.

Cause
The vertigo attacks are caused by pulsatile compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve by blood vessels (in 70% of cases the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA)) in the cerebellopontine angle, which can cause demyelinsation of the nerve. The nerve is particularly susceptible in the area of the nerve entry zone into the brain stem, as the structure of the myelin sheath changes here (from oligodendrocytes to Schwann cells).

Diagnosis
In terms of the diagnostic criteria we find that the following must be met:

At least ten attacks of spontaneous spinning or non-spinning vertigo
Duration less than 1 minute
Stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient
Response to a treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine
Not better accounted for by another diagnosis.
A definiteve diagnosis can usually only be made after a successful attempt at pharmacotherapy. Vascular-nerve contact demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging is not part of the diagnostic criteria. Appropriate imaging should be performed to rule out other structural changes in the cerebellopontine angle.

Treatment
Pharmacotherapy often involves oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine or lacosamide. In very rare cases, surgery in the form of microvascular decompression may also be indicated.

Prognosis
In a long-term study (mean follow-up time 4.8 years), around 75% of patients remained without vertigo attacks, and in more than half of them no drug therapy was necessary.

Epidemiology
Depending on the origin, there are two peaks in frequency: in the case of causative vascular malformations, those affected become symptomatic at a young age, while age-associated vascular changes usually cause symptoms for the first time between the ages of 40 and 70. Men are affected twice as often as women. Vestibular paroxysmia accounts for around 3% of diagnoses in specialized vertigo outpatient clinics.

Broomball,"Broomball is a both a recreational and organized competitive winter and ball sport played on ice or snow. It is played either indoors or outdoors, depending on the climate and location. It is most popularly played in Canada and the United States.
Unlike most winter team sports played on ice, organized broomball does not use ice skates. Player footwear for formal play consists of shoes created specifically for broomball which are designed to improve a player's traction on the ice. Though the sport can be played outdoors on snow, organized broomball in the 21st century is primarily played on an ice hockey rink.
Players hit a ball around the ice or snow with a stick. Regardless of whether the broomball stick used by players is a literal broom or a conventional broomball stick with a molded paddle-shaped end, the stick is simply called a ""broom."" The broom may have a wooden or aluminum shaft and has a rubber-molded triangular head similar in shape to that of a regular broom (or, originally, an actual corn broom with the bristles either cut off or covered with tape or another restricting material). Players wear special rubber-soled shoes instead of skates, and the ice is prepared in such a way that it is smooth and dry to improve traction. The ball used differs based on location: The indoor ball is smooth while the outdoor ball has ridges and resembles a small soccer ball.
In a game of broomball there are two teams, each consisting of six players: a goaltender and five others. The object of the game is to score more goals than the opponent. Goals are scored by hitting the ball into the opponent's net using a traditional broom or the more conventional paddle-shaped stick designed for the sport. Tactics and plays are similar to those used in sports such as ice hockey, roller hockey and floorball. The sport uses its own offside rules in both International Federation of Broomball Associations (IFBA) rules and American broomball rules, but both differ. While ice hockey goal nets are sometimes used, a regulation-sized broomball net is considerably larger by comparison. IFBA sanctioned games use a 5-by-7-foot (1.5 m × 2.1 m) net, while American broomball uses 6-by-8-foot (1.8 m × 2.4 m) nets.
The sport involves organized competitions and events run by its international governing body, the IFBA. The national organization in Canada is Broomball Canada while in the United States the two main organizations are All Elite Broomball (AEB) and the United States Broomball Association (USBA). Every two years the IFBA holds the IFBA World Broomball Championships (also known as the Challenge Cup), an international event with teams from around the world. Historically, the championships have been dominated by the North American teams.
A similar game called Moscow broomball is played in Russia.

Gameplay
The sport is played on either an indoor or outdoor ice rink. Conventional play involves the use equipment designed specifically for broomball, though recreationally the tr",sports
List of tram systems by gauge and electrification,"The following is a list of tram/streetcar (including heritage trams/heritage streetcars), or light rail systems with their track length, track gauge, electrification system.
The vast majority of tram systems use 1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) standard gauge. Generally, standard gauge is the standard for every brand new system (except for the former Soviet Union), even in places where there is another gauge for the heavy rail. Metre gauge is mainly present in some old, continuously operating systems in Central Europe. Russian gauge is used only in the former Soviet Union.
The electrification system for the old systems is generally 600 V DC while the more recent systems use 750 V DC. Some old systems upgraded to 750 V in recent years (mostly in Germany) while some systems (e.g. Romania) downgraded the voltage to 600 V to use the second-hand vehicles coming from the upgraded German networks. Few systems are partially or wholly catenary-free, with APS and ACR systems or using a pure internal power source as battery or ultracapacitors. Very few vintage systems are horse-drawn tram or cable car.

Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy,"Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy (AEPP) is a peer-reviewed journal of applied economics and policy. Published four times per year, it is the one of two journals published by the Agricultural & Applied Economics Association (AAEA), along with the American Journal of Agricultural Economics (AJAE). Today is the leading journal in 'applied economics' with a 2020 impact factor of 4.083.
The purpose of AEPP is to analyze areas of current applied economic research in an effort to inform the policy-makers and decision makers; and to generate connections between sub-fields of agricultural and applied economics in order to focus future research and increase knowledge of those in the field about the impact of public policy.

History
Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy was first published as the Illinois Agricultural Economics from 1961 to 1978. It then changed its name to the North Central Journal of Agricultural Economics from 1979 to 1990, and then Review of Agricultural Economics from 1991 to 2009. It took its current name in 2010, in order to appeal to a wider audience. In addition to changing the name, the focus of the journal changed as well.

Editors
The current editors of the AEPP are Craig Gundersen from the Baylor University, Mindy Mallory from the Purdue University Purdue University and Daniel Petrolia from Mississippi State University.

Industrial Age,"The Industrial Age is a period of history that encompasses the changes in economic and social organization that began around 1760 in Great Britain and later in other countries, characterized chiefly by the replacement of hand tools with power-driven machines such as the power loom and the steam engine, and by the concentration of industry in large establishments.
While it is commonly believed that the Industrial Age was supplanted by the Information Age in the late 20th century, a view that has become common since the Revolutions of 1989, much of the Third World economy is still based on manufacturing, although mobile phones are now commonplace even in the poorest of countries, enabling access to global information networks. Even though many developing countries remain largely industrial, the Information Age is increasingly on the ground.

Origins
Huge changes in agricultural methods made the Industrial Revolution possible. This agricultural revolution started with changes in farming in the Netherlands, later developed by the British.
The Industrial Age began in Great Britain in the mid-18th century and was fueled by coal mining from places such as Wales and County Durham.
The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain because it had the factors of production, land (all natural resources), capital, and labour. Britain had plenty of harbors that enabled trade, Britain had access to capital, such as goods and money, for example, tools, machinery, equipment, and inventory. Britain, lastly, had an abundance of labor, or industrial workers in this case. There are many other conditions that help show why the Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain. The British Isles and colonies overseas represented huge markets that created a large demand for British goods. Britain also had one of the largest spheres of influence due to its massive navy and merchant marine. The British government's concern for commercial interests was also important. 
The steam engine allowed for steamboats and the locomotives, which made transportation much faster. By the mid-19th century the Industrial Revolution had spread to Continental Europe and North America, and since then it has spread to most of the world.

The textile industry
The cotton industry was the first industry to go through mechanization, the use of automatic machinery to increase production. The domestic system sprouted as a result of when businesses began importing raw cotton, employing spinners and weavers to make it into cloth from their home. James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which could produce eight times as much thread as a single spinning wheel, and Richard Arkwright made it driven by water. Later Arkwright opened a spinning mill which marked the beginning of the factory system. In 1785, Edmund Cartwright invented a loom which was powered by water.

Steam engines
In 1712, Thomas Newcomen produced the first successful steam engine, and in 1769, James Watt patented the modern steam engine.",history
Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture,"The Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture (ARMA) (Polish: Agencja Restrukturyzacji i Modernizacji Rolnictwa (ARiMR)) is a state legal entity established by the Act of December 29, 1993, on the establishment of the Agency for Restructuring and Modernization of Agriculture to support the development of agriculture and rural areas. Currently, it operates based on the Act of May 9, 2008, on the Agency for Restructuring and Modernization of Agriculture.
ARMA has been designated by the government to serve as an accredited paying agency. It implements instruments co-financed from the European Union budget and provides assistance from national funds. As an executor of agricultural policy, the agency closely cooperates with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

History of Long Island,"Long Island has had a long recorded history from the first European settlements in the 17th century to today.  Greatly influenced by construction of railroads in the 19th century, it experienced growth in tourism as well as the development of towns and villages into some of the first modern suburbs in the United States.

Native American settlements
At the time of European contact, the Lenape people (named the Delaware by Europeans) inhabited the western end of the Island, and spoke the Munsee dialect of the Algonquian language family. Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to record an encounter with these people when he entered what is now New York Bay in 1524.
The eastern portion of the island was inhabited by speakers of the Mohegan-Montauk-Narragansett language group of the same language family, representing their ties to the aboriginal peoples inhabiting what is now Connecticut and Rhode Island.  The area was central to the production of Wampum, providing the resources necessary for its creation.

Decades after the decline in population of Native American on Long Island, amateur anthropologist Silas Wood published a book claiming that there had been several homogenous ""tribes"" traditional to Long Island; they erroneously became collectively known as the Metoac, a word that has no known Native American origin and means nothing in any indigenous language on Long Island.  Modern scientific scholarship has shown that there were two linguistic groups representing two cultural identities on the island, as noted above, not ""13 tribes"" as asserted by Wood.  The Montaukett, Unkechaug, and Shinnecock nations, three Native American groups with ties to aboriginal inhabitants, still live on the island.
A Native American name for Long Island is Paumanok, meaning ""The Island that Pays Tribute"".  More powerful tribes in the surrounding areas forced the relatively peaceful Long Islanders to give tributes and payment to avoid attacks.

Colony
Dutch and English Settlements
The western portion of Long Island was settled by the Dutch, who named it 't Lange Eylandt, which  translates to the Long Island in old-Dutch. They also had early settlements in the 17th century on what are now Manhattan and Staten Island.
On April 22, 1636, Charles I of England ordered that the Plymouth Colony, which had laid claim to the island but had not settled it, give the island to William Alexander.  Alexander through his agent James Farret (who personally received Shelter Island and Robins Island) in turn sold most of the eastern island to the New Haven and Connecticut colonies.
English settlers first arrived at Southold in eastern Long Island in 1636/37 and were involved in the distillation of turpentine resins. Among those who first settled in Southold were Matthew Sunderland, William Salmon, Thomas Reeve, Thomas Terrill, Thomas Benedict, and Henry Whitney, with Sunderland, Salmon, Whitney, and Benedict taking equal ownership of land tracts Sunderland had received from Farr",history
Test cricket,"Test Cricket is a format of the sport of cricket, considered the game’s most prestigious and traditional form. Often referred to as the ""ultimate test"" of a cricketer's skill, endurance, and temperament, it is a format of international cricket where two teams in white clothing, each representing a country, compete over a match that can last up to five days. It consists of four innings (two per team), with a minimum of ninety overs scheduled to be bowled per day, making it the sport with the longest playing time. A team wins the match by outscoring the opposition in the batting or bowl out in bowling, otherwise the match ends in a draw.
It is contested by 12 teams which are the full-members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The term ""test match"" was originally coined in 1861–62 but in a different context. Test cricket did not become an officially recognised format until the 1890s, but many international matches since 1877 have been retrospectively awarded Test status. The first such match took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in March 1877 between teams which were then known as a Combined Australian XI and James Lillywhite's XI, the latter a team of visiting English professionals. Matches between Australia and England were first called ""test matches"" in 1892. The first definitive list of retrospective Tests was written by South Australian journalist Clarence P. Moody two years later and, by the end of the century, had gained acceptance.
Day/night Tests were permitted by the ICC in 2012 and the first day/night match was between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval in November 2015.
The ICC World Test Championship is the international championship of Test cricket. It is a league competition run by the ICC, with its inaugural season starting in 2019. In line with the ICC's goal of having one pinnacle tournament for each of the three formats of international cricket, it is the premier championship for Test cricket.

Early history
Growth of international cricket
Teams designated as ""England"" or ""All England"" began to play in the 18th century, but these teams were not truly representative. Early international cricket was disrupted by the French Revolution and the American Civil War. The earliest international cricket match was between the United States and Canada, on 24 and 26 September 1844 (bad weather prevented play on the 25th). Overseas tours by national English teams began in 1859 with visits to North America, Australia and New Zealand. The 1868 Australian Aboriginals were the first organised overseas team to tour England.

Two rival English tours of Australia were proposed in the early months of 1877, with James Lillywhite campaigning for a professional tour and Fred Grace for an amateur one. Grace's tour fell through and it was Lillywhite's team that toured New Zealand and Australia in 1876–77. Two matches against a combined Australian XI were later classified as the first official Test matches. The first match was",sports
Madan Sara,"A Madan Sara or Madam Sara (often called Saras), is a woman in Haiti who buys agricultural produce from farmers, transports it to markets, and sells it to merchants. They are an important link between rural producers and urban consumers. An estimated 100,000 women work full or part-time as Madan Saras. They mostly market the produce of small farmers, of whom there are about 700,000. They often provide pre-harvest credit to farmers. Although a few Madan Saras operate internationally and at a large scale, the great majority are small middlemen with little education or capital who are in constant motion between their suppliers in rural areas and their customers in rural and urban markets. 
Madan Saras are vulnerable to sexual assault, robbery, exploitation, and rape.

History
The origin of the term ""Madan Sara"" is the Haitian word for the village weaver, a small, noisy bird that congregates in flocks and often lives in colonies of many nests. The female traders are called the same. 
The origin of the Madan Saras was in the 18th century when Haiti was a colony of large plantations utilizing slave labor. On the margins of the plantations the slaves were allowed to cultivate small acreages. Marketing and distribution of crops produced on the slave farms became the job of female slaves. They were allowed to meet at rural crossroads to sell or barter their produce. Women handled marketing because they had more freedom of movement than male slaves. 
Males were likely to flee the plantation if allowed to travel. Women usually had family ties on the plantation and were less likely to run away. Many of the women became itinerant traders, a characteristic that has endured into the 21st century. Men work the farms; women are often in charge of marketing the crops produced on the farms.

The Saras
The typical Madan Sara is a poor rural woman of little education. About one-half of them are illiterate, not unusual for Haiti which has a literacy rate of only 61 percent. She will typically have a husband and a family. The husband is a farmer who owns a small plot of land or is self employed. Saras may also own a plot of land which she cultivates herself or hires labor. Most Madan Saras buy produce in the area in which they live or where they have kinship ties. They move their produce on foot, donkey, horse, or public transport to markets, some local and rural, others in the largest cities of Haiti.
Although a few Saras operate with a truckload of produce, most have little capital. Most are among Haiti's poor who number 59 percent of the country's population and survive on less that two U.S. dollars income per day. The World Bank in 2019 estimated that Madan Saras have working capital between 2,000 Haitian gourdes (20 U.S. dollars) and one million Haitian gourdes (50,000 U.S. dollars). In 2002, a scholar found that the average purchase cost of produce by a Sara was 27 U.S. dollars. In 2014, among Madan Saras who journey to the market in the capital and largest city,",economics
Doubles curling,"Doubles curling (most commonly seen as mixed doubles) is a variation of the sport of curling with only two players on each team.  Mixed doubles is the most common format of doubles curling, where the term 'mixed' specifies that each team is composed of one man and one woman. The term mixed is also used to describe a specific format of 4-person team curling where the team consists of two men and two women and the throwing order alternates genders, see mixed team.
With its smaller teams and quicker games, doubles curling has provided an opportunity for more countries to participate in international competition. At the 2019 World Mixed Doubles Championship 48 of the 61 World Curling Federation member countries were represented, including the first international curling competition for Kosovo, Ukraine, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico.

History
The idea was developed by Curling Canada's Warren Hansen in 2001 to be one of four discipline variations for the inaugural Continental Cup of Curling.
The first World Mixed Doubles Championship took place in 2008. Since its inception, Switzerland has won six of its first ten titles. Russia and Hungary have won their first world curling titles in the mixed doubles championship, and New Zealand, France, Austria, and the Czech Republic have won their first world curling medals.
In 2002, Olympic scholar Bob Barney advocated for mixed doubles curling to be added to the Winter Olympics. He argued that it was a sport without any ""gender factor"", and high television ratings; and noted that equestrian events at the Summer Olympics was the only Olympic sport allowing males and females to compete against each other.
The IOC did not approve the events for inclusion into the 2010 Winter Olympics, but an attempt to include the mixed doubles in the following winter Olympiad succeeded, making its Olympic debut at the 2018 Winter Olympics. John Morris and Kaitlyn Lawes won the first mixed doubles gold medal for Canada, defeating Switzerland in the final. The Olympic Athletes from Russia won the bronze medal match only to have their medal stripped from them after Alexander Krushelnitsky failed a drug test. Team Norway, who had finished fourth, was then awarded the bronze medal.

Rules of play
In doubles curling each two-person team plays with six stones, one of which is positioned in play before the start of the end. One stone is placed on the center line in the 4-foot circle of the house such that the back edge of the stone is aligned with the back edge of the circle. The other positioned stone is placed on the center line as a guard in front of the house. The exact placement of this positioned guard is chosen from six possible locations and must be agreed upon by the teams before the game. The six possible locations are immediately in front of and behind three points along the center line, the midpoint between the hog line and the front of the house and 3 feet in front of and behind that midpoint. The teams decide on the gua",sports
Underwater ice hockey,"Underwater ice hockey (also called sub-aqua ice hockey) is a minor extreme sport that is a variant of ice hockey. It is played upside-down underneath frozen pools or ponds. Participants wear diving masks, fins, and wetsuits and use the underside of the frozen surface as the playing area or rink for a floating puck. Competitors do not use any breathing apparatus but instead surface for air every 30 seconds or so.
It is not to be confused with underwater hockey, in which the floor of a swimming pool and a sinking puck are used.

History
Underwater ice hockey is an extreme sport that requires a considerable amount of breath-holding skills, training, and patience in order to finish unscathed. The sport, UIC, originated in Austria in 2005 when an apnea diver, also known as breath-hold diving, skin diving, or freediving, named Christian Redl from Austria came up with the sport. The idea behind the sport was to take the enjoyment of hockey and turn it into an extreme sport that most divers would be fond of. The first world championship game took place in Weissensee, Austria, in 2007, where teams competed below 12 inches of ice in 35.6 °F or 2 °C water. Water freezes at 32 °F, or 0 °C. At these temperatures, the ice will be thick enough to support the weight of spectators, equipment, and tents to keep people warm while also providing a safe under-ice rink for competitors. This means that finding a location for the matches proved difficult because officials and organizers are required to find an area of ice that was thick enough to hold the weight of all the spectators, and safety officials for the free divers were needed.
This 2007 match was the first recorded Underwater Ice Hockey World Championship game; however, this was not the first ever match to be played. There were two matches before this, one in 2005 and one in 2006, where founder and organizer Christian Redl mobilized teams from around Europe to participate. The first match in 2005 was between Austria and Germany, which ended in an 8–8 tie. The second match in 2006 was between Austria and Slovakia, which ended in a 9–8 victory for Austria. Since then, one other world championship game was held in 2013, also at Weissensee, Austria. Both of these matches were organized by founder Christian Redl in hopes of furthering the sport, and over the last 12 years, Redl has been successful in bringing this minor extreme sport to the world; however, due to the nature of the activity, it is still limited to extreme sport enthusiasts and apnea divers. Historically, the aspect of the game that has drawn a lot of apnea divers, especially apnea divers under ice, is the conditions in which the sport is played. It involves a lot of skills that come with free diving, such as holding breath for a prolonged period of time, the ability to disorient between up and down, and the sheer excitement of playing a high-risk sport.

Founder
The sport was created by free diver Christian Redl with help from his friend and traini",sports
Digor (sports),"Digor or degor is a traditional sport in Bhutan, somewhat resembling the sport of shot put.

Digor is played with a pair of spherical flat stones that are hurled at two targets (pegs) fixed in the ground about 20 meters apart. The game is played all over Bhutan, but typically more in rural areas, and more often by men.
The only required equipment for playing the game is a pair of flat spherical stones for each player. The size and weight of the stones differ from player to player depending on his choice and strength. A player can have as many stones of any size as he wants, but can play only two at a time.
Digor can be played as a team game or individual game. If there are three persons, the game is played as on individual gaming basis. If there are four or more persons, it is preferred to be played in two teams that compete against each other. There is no fixed numbers of players on the teams, but too many players make the game slower and cumbersome. So, normally seven players on each team is the maximum number for an ideal game.
Unlike shot put, each player hurls a pair of spherical stones to the targets from one end to the other by swinging the arm below the shoulders. The target pegs are nailed into the ground with their tips at ground level. As in horseshoes, the players try to make their stone land and remain closest to the target peg. A point is scored if the distance between stone and the peg is less than the distance between the thumb and middle finger of an outstretched palm. If two or more stones of opponent teams fall in same range, the closest stone will score the point. If all stones in the range belong to one team, then the team will score as many points as the number of stones. There is no fixed point score at which the game ends, but it is normally fixed at odd numbers up to 21, depending on the number of the players and the time the teams have.
Unlike in archery, in digor the best players play first to occupy the area near the target. The players playing later are allowed to hit the stones of opponent players that have been played before with their own stones to displace them from the target and replace them with their stones. But it is more difficult if the stones played beforehand are heavy and solid. So, players prefer heavier stones so that these cannot be easily displaced or can be used as a better force to displace other players' stones.
Betting on the game differs from region to region and the occasion of the game being played. If the game is being played between villages, there may or may not be a bet. At times it is just played for the fame of victory. However, the game is mostly played to celebrate some occasions such as New Year and other major holidays. On such occasions, the betting is normally fixed on a grand feast and party where the loser will have to stand for the party solely or major chunk while the winner could share a little part. This kind of betting usually occurs for merrymaking and socializing within th",sports
The Establishment,"In sociology and in political science, the term ""the establishment"" describes the dominant social group, the elite who control a polity, an organization, or an institution. In the praxis of wealth and power, the Establishment usually is a self-selecting, closed elite entrenched within specific institutions — hence, a relatively small social class can exercise all socio-political control.
In 1955, the journalist Henry Fairlie popularized the contemporary usage of the term The Establishment to denote the network of socially prominent and politically important people:

By the 'Establishment' I do not mean only the centres of official power — though they are certainly part of it — but rather the whole matrix of official and social relations within which power is exercised. The exercise of power in Britain (more specifically, in England) cannot be understood unless it is recognised that it is exercised socially.
Consequently, the term the Establishment became common usage in the press of London; The Oxford English Dictionary cites Fairlie's column originating the British usages of the term the Establishment, as in the established church denoting the official Church of England. Moreover, in sociologic jargon, an outsider is the person who is not a member of The Establishment.

Australia
The term establishment is often used in Australia to refer both to the main political parties and also to the powers behind those parties. In the book, Anti-political Establishment Parties: A Comparative Analysis by Amir Abedi (2004), Amir Abedi refers to the Labor Party and the Coalition Parties (the Liberal Party and the National/Country Party) as the establishment parties.

Canada
The original Canadian Establishment began as a mix between the British and American models, combining political appointments and business acumen.  In Francophone Canada, the local leaders of the Catholic Church played a major role. The Family Compact is the first identifiable Canadian Establishment in Anglophone Canada.
The journalist Peter C. Newman defined the modern Canadian Establishment in his 1975 book The Canadian Establishment. It catalogued the richest individuals and families living in Canada at the time. All of the specific people he identified were prominent business leaders, especially in the media and in public transit. Newman reports that several of these old families have maintained their importance into the twenty-first century.

Hong Kong
The term is also used in politics of Hong Kong, where political parties, community groups, chambers of commerce, trade unions and individuals who are cooperative with and loyal to the Chinese Communist Party and the post-handover Hong Kong Government are labelled (most often self-labelled) ""pro-Beijing"" or ""pro-establishment"". The term first appeared in 2004.

The term ""Official Ireland"" is commonly used in the Republic of Ireland to denote the media, cultural and religious establishment.

Psychophysiological economics,"Psychophysiological economics is a field of study focused on the assessment and evaluation of psychological and physiological events as factors shaping consumer economic behavior. Psychophysiological economists believe that behavior and cognitive processing are indivisible and that behavioral, cognitive, and physiological tools and techniques can be combined to create interventions that improve the economic well-being of consumers.
Psychophysiological economics differs from behavioral economics by focusing on direct measures of physiological change and observational data, in addition to attitudinal measurement. Psychophysiological economics also differs from functional magnetic resonance imaging, which is typically applied exclusively to the study of brain activity. Psychophysiological economics emphasizes the role of the peripheral nervous system as it relates to shaping economic behavior.
The peripheral nervous system includes the spinal and cranial nerves. Of specific relevance is the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). The ANS regulates glands and other internal organs (visceral structures). Visceral structures control involuntary physiological activities and behavior. ANS increases electrodermal activity (EDA) and electrocardiogram activity (ECG), this phenomenon is also referred to as physiological arousal. Psychophysiological economics researchers directly measure the sympathetic nervous system as a person responds to stressor within the environment.

Assumptions
Three assumptions provide the basis for psychophysiological economics studies. First, stress shapes how consumers react, both physically and mentally, to economic challenges (i.e., stressors). Second, stress cannot be evaluated and assessed easily using traditional observational methods. Third, both eustress (positive stress) and distress (negative stress) can alter behavior by causing changes in a person’s visceral structures. These changes occur involuntarily, but the underlying cause can be measured and evaluated.

Scope
As a new field of study, psychophysiological economics tends to be focused on evaluating and assessing physiological aspects of economic behavior. Clinical and experimental  research uses the following tools to evaluate stress responses:

Cardiovascular activity: heart rate variability
Electrodermal activity: skin conductance
Peripheral skin temperature: sympathetic activation (sympathetic nervous system)
Respiratory feedback: breathing patterns
Surface electromyography: muscle tension patterns (muscle tone)
Sweat production
Elevated blood pressure
These tools allow Psychophysiological Economics researchers to evaluate directly, in real time, the relationship between cognition and economic behavior. In general, someone experiencing economic stress (either acute or chronic) should exhibit the following characteristics as they relate to any given economic stressor: (a) muscle tension, (b) increased sweat production, (c) a decrease in peripheral skin temperature, (d) ",economics
Vigoro,"Vigoro is a team sport, played mainly by women in Australia, that originally combined elements of cricket and tennis, although in its current form it may be more similar to cricket and baseball.

History
The game was invented in 1901 by Englishman John George Grant. In the original version tennis rackets were used and the wicket consisted of six stumps. On 17 October 1902, a match was played before the MCC committee at Lord's. An eleven led by real tennis and rackets player Eustace Miles, and including Wimbledon champions Laurence and Reginald Doherty, defeated the opposition, led by Surrey batsman Bobby Abel. Miles' team led after the first innings by 73 to 18 runs and won by an innings after Abel's team made only 39 runs in the second innings. That same month the game was also played at Crystal Palace. Games were also played that year, and in 1903, at London's Queen's Club. In England interest in the game died down after a few years but it managed to gain a foothold in Australia where it was introduced during World War I. A key figure in the promotion of the game in Australia was Ettie Dodge, who was President (1919–66) of the New South Wales Women's Vigoro Association and foundation president (1932–66) of the All Australian [Vigoro] Association. Ettie's husband had met John George Grant in England. When the game was introduced to New South Wales schools in the 1920s, Dodge & Co. began selling vigoro equipment. Grant died in 1927 and bequeathed the trademark and copyright of the game to Ettie.

Description
Vigoro is played on a pitch which shall be no shorter than 17.68 m [58'], which is slightly shorter in length than a cricket pitch. The balls are much lighter than those for cricket, and the bat has a different shape with a long handle resembling the shape of a paddle.
There are two teams of 12 players which will bat and field two innings each (except in the event that a team wins with an innings in hand). The aim of the game is for a team to score more runs than the opposition team.
There are no overs and the batsmen bat from one end only. Two bowlers bowl alternately and can incorporate any type of ""throwing"" action as long as the ball is released above the shoulder (i.e. not underarm).
If the ball is hit forward of the crease, the batter must run.
A run is completed each time both batters safely make it to the crease at the opposite end of the pitch. Fours and sixes also apply where the batter hits the ball past the boundary markers. In addition to shots made off the bat, byes and leg-byes add to the team's score.
Players may be dismissed by the same methods as in cricket – bowled, caught, run out, stumped, leg before wicket, hit wicket, handled ball and hit the ball twice.

Interstate competition
Teams from Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland compete annually for the All Australian Vigoro Titles.  These teams compete across four divisions – State (Senior) One and Two, Veterans and Juniors.

Ginger group,"A ginger group is a formal or informal group within an organisation seeking to influence its direction and activity. The term comes from the phrase ginger up, meaning to enliven or stimulate. Ginger groups work to alter the organisation's policies, practices, or office-holders, while still supporting its general goals. Ginger groups sometimes form within the political parties of Commonwealth countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Pakistan.

The Monday Night Cabal
The Monday Night Cabal was a 'ginger group' of influential people set up in London by Leo Amery at the start of 1916 to discuss war policy. The nucleus of the group consisted of Lord Milner, George Carson, Geoffrey Dawson, Waldorf Astor and F. S. Oliver. The group got together for Monday night dinners and to discuss politics. Throughout 1916, their numbers and influence grew to include Minister of Munitions David Lloyd George, General Henry Wilson, Philip Kerr, and Mark Jameson. It was through the Ginger Group that Times editor Geoffrey Dawson published a December 4, 1916 news story titled ""Reconstruction"" that set in motion events that caused Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to resign, signalling the rise of the Lloyd George Ministry.

Outline of natural science,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to natural science:
Natural science – a major branch of science that tries to explain, and predict, nature's phenomena based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypothesis must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory.  Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into 2 main branches: life science, and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.

Overview
Natural science can be described as all of the following:

Branch of science – systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.
Major category of academic disciplines – an academic discipline is focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with academic areas of study or areas of professional practice. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines. For instance, Gravitation is strongly associated with the discipline of physics, and is considered to be part of that disciplinary knowledge.

Branches of natural science
Physical science
Physical science – branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to the biological sciences. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a ""physical science"", together called the ""physical sciences"". However, the term ""physical"" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena (organic chemistry, for example).

Astronomy
Astronomy – studies the universe beyond Earth, including its formation and development, and the evolution, physics, chemistry, meteorology, and motion of celestial objects (such as galaxies, planets, etc.) and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth (such as the cosmic background radiation).
Astrobiology – study of evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe—also known as exobiology, exopaleontology, and bioastronomy
Astrodynamics – application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft.
Astrophysics – study of the physical aspects of celestial objects.
Astrometry – branch of astronomy that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestially  bodies.
Cosmology – discipline that deals with the nature of the Universe as a whole.
Extragalactic astronomy – branch of astronomy concerned with objects outside our own Milky Way Galaxy
Galactic astronomy – study of our own Milky Way galaxy and all its content",science
Social simulation,"Social simulation is a research field that applies computational methods to study issues in the social sciences. The issues explored include problems in computational law, psychology, organizational behavior, sociology, political science, economics, anthropology, geography, engineering, archaeology and linguistics (Takahashi, Sallach & Rouchier 2007).
Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the natural sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.
In social simulation, computers support human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as complex non-linear systems, which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models. Robert Axelrod regards social simulation as a third way of doing science, differing from both the deductive and inductive approach; generating data that can be analysed inductively, but coming from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than from direct measurement of the real world. Thus, simulating a phenomenon is akin to generating it—constructing artificial societies. These ambitious aims have encountered several criticisms.
The social simulation approach to the social sciences is promoted and coordinated by four regional associations, the European Social Simulation Association (ESSA) for Europe, the Asian Social Simulation Association (ASSA) for Asia, the Computational Social Science Society of the Americas (CSSS) in North America, and the Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences (PAAA) in Pacific Asia.

History and development
The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the Von Neumann machine, a theoretical machine capable of reproducing itself. The device John von Neumann proposed woud follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then improved by von Neumann's friend Stanislaw Ulam, also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of devices later termed cellular automata.
Another improvement was brought by mathematician, John Conway. He constructed the well-known Game of Life. Unlike the von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional checkerboard.
The birth of the agent-based model as a model for social systems was primarily brought about by a computer scientist, Craig Reynolds. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as the artificial life, a term coined by Christopher Langton.
Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell developed the first large scale agent model, the Sugarscape, to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, comb",science
Ice hockey,"Ice hockey (or simply hockey in North America) is a team sport played on ice skates, usually on an ice skating rink with lines and markings specific to the sport. It belongs to a family of sports called hockey. Two opposing teams use ice hockey sticks to control, advance, and shoot a vulcanized rubber hockey puck into the other team's net. Each goal is worth one point. The team with the highest score after an hour of playing time is declared the winner; ties are broken in overtime or a shootout. In a formal game, each team has six skaters on the ice at a time, barring any penalties, including a goaltender. It is a full contact game and one of the more physically demanding team sports. 
The modern sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in Montreal, where the first indoor game was played on March 3, 1875. It draws influence from shinty which originated in Scotland, as well as field hockey which originated in England. Some characteristics of ice hockey, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and professional ice hockey originated around 1900. The Stanley Cup, emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was initially commissioned in 1892 as the ""Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup"" and was first awarded in 1893 to recognise the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the National Hockey League (NHL). In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace, in Paris, France, the precursor to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). The sport was played for the first time at the Olympics during the 1920 Summer Games—today it is a mainstay at the Winter Olympics. In 1994, ice hockey was officially recognized as Canada's national winter sport.

While women also played during the game's early formative years, it was not until organizers began to officially remove body checking from female ice hockey beginning in the mid-1980s that it began to gain greater popularity, which by then had spread to Europe and a variety of other countries. The IIHF Women's World Championship was held in 1990, and women's play was introduced into the Olympics in 1998.

History
Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, Ireland, and elsewhere, primarily bandy, hurling, and shinty. The North American sport of lacrosse, derived from tribal Native American games, was also influential. The former games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules developed, such as shinny and ice polo, but later were absorbed into a new organized game with codified rules which today is ice hockey.

Game
While the general characteristics of the game remain constant, the exact rules depend on the particular code of play being used. The two most important codes are those of the IIHF and the NHL. Both ",sports

Al-Hawi,"Kitab al-Hawi or Al-Hawi or Kitāb al-Ḥāwī fī al-ṭibb translated as The Comprehensive Book on Medicine is an extensive medical encyclopedia authored by the Persian polymath Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (865–925), commonly known in the West as Rhazes in the 10th century. This monumental work is a compendium of Greek, Syrian, and early Arabic medical knowledge, as well as some Indian medical practices.
It was first translated into Latin in 1279 under the title Continens by Faraj ben Salim, a physician of Sicilian-Jewish origin employed by Charles of Anjou.
The oldest partial remaining copy of this work belongs to the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland dated 1094 CE.

Historical context and composition
The Kitab al-Hawi was composed around the year 900 and spans 22 volumes. It was later published by the Dairat'l-Macarif-il-Osmania (Osmania Oriental Publications Bureau) in Hyderabad-Deccan.

Contents and significance
The book covers a wide range of medical topics, including theoretical  and practical medicine. Al-Razi's approach was notably comprehensive, as he not only included medical knowledge from Greek and Syrian sources but also incorporated insights from Indian medical traditions.
Al-Razi frequently recommended various treatments, including those that might be considered magical remedies by today's standards. For instance, he addressed conditions such as quartan fever and recommended specific practices for their treatment.

Legacy
The Kitab al-Hawi had a profound influence on the development of medical knowledge in the medieval Islamic world and subsequently in Europe. It was translated into Latin in the 12th century and became one of the main sources of medical knowledge in medieval Europe.

Sri Lankan place name etymology,"Sri Lankan place name etymology is characterized by the linguistic and ethnic diversity of the island of Sri Lanka through the ages and the position of the country in the centre of ancient and medieval sea trade routes. While typical Sri Lankan placenames of Sinhalese origin vastly dominate, toponyms which stem from Tamil, Dutch, English, Portuguese and Arabic also exist. In the past, the many composite or hybrid place names and the juxtaposition of Sinhala and Tamil placenames reflected the coexistence of people of both language groups. Today, however, toponyms and their etymologies are a source of heated political debate in the country as part of the political struggles between the majority Sinhalese  and minority Sri Lankan Tamils.

Morphological structure of place names
The morphological structure of Sri Lankan place names by and large depends on the language. Sinhala and Tamil favour transparent compounds involving geological features combined with an animal or plant, while the European languages are more person centered and derive place names from saints or nobility or army.

Sinhalese
Place names of Sinhala origin, have a typical X+Y structure, where Y is a geographical feature such as
mountain, river or village
and X is a qualifier, like an animal or plant often found at that place, or otherwise associated with it. Examples for this are

singha+pitiya ""lion place""
weli+gama ""sand village""
monara+gala ""peacock rock"".
Commonly used trees in village names are pol (coconut) and Kitul (palm), among others.
The X part can be complex as in

kiri bath goda = milk rice village
The X part can also refer to social concepts like caste. Examples for this are waduwa (carpenter), batta (lower caste settlement), ambataya (barber), aruwa (potter), goviya (farmer), bamuna (Brahmin) and Villiya (Rodiya).
Besides the Y parts already mentioned, other commonly used land usage forms are Kumbura (paddy fields), Deniya, watte (garden), pola, gama (village), and Hena (cultivated lands). Grasslands were termed as talava and tree groves were termed golla. Village tanks were called pokuna or katuwa. Irrigation tanks were called wewa.  Canals from such lakes were called aala. Flat lands were termed botha. Ports were termed tota.  Names of flower gardens belonging to Buddhist establishments end with uyana.

Tamil
Place names of Tamil origin, like Sinhala origin, also have a typical X+Y structure.
The place names are simple and descriptive; they reflect criteria normal to early societies and are related to the concepts and outlooks of people of those times. The majority of the place names can be listed under caste and occupational, landforms, land classifications, coastal features, irrigation works, fields and farms, trees, animals, names of deities, personal names, old, new, big, small, good, settlement and village.
The X-part in Tamil place names is often one of the following: The commonly used trees are Vembu, Panai (palm) and Illupai. Commonly used animals and birds",history
Bolsominion,"Bolsominion (from the English minion) is a pejorative term used by opponents of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to refer to a segment of his supporters. The word is an amalgamation combining the first half of the surname Bolsonaro, and the word minion (""servant"", ""follower""), which is also the name of the characters in the Despicable Me franchise. The term gained prominence in Brazilian media with the rise of Bolsonaro throughout his 2018 presidential campaign.

Ideology
In general, bolsominions are described as extreme right-wing people who are uncompromising, reactionary and adept at military intervention to solve problems related to public health, education, security. They often use the term ""esquerdopata"" (pathological left) to refer to opponents, which is a term used on the internet to treat leftist ideology as a disease (psychopathy), to which its opponents usually respond by using the term ""direitopata"" (pathological right) to designate them. They see the relationship between military intervention and morality as closely linked factors and they are, in general, antagonistic to agendas considered progressive.
Many are also supporters of the Trump administration.

Use
In 2019, federal deputy Eduardo Bolsonaro celebrated his 35th birthday with a party themed around  Minions, the characters from the Despicable Me franchise, which was reported as referring to the term Bolsominion.

Caretaker government,"A caretaker government, also known as a caretaker regime, is a temporary ad hoc government that performs some governmental duties and functions in a country until a regular government is elected or formed. Depending on specific practice, it consists of either randomly selected members of parliament or outgoing members until their dismissal.
Caretaker governments in representative democracies are usually limited in their function, serving only to maintain the status quo, rather than truly govern and propose new legislation. Unlike the government it is meant to temporarily replace, a caretaker government does not have a legitimate mandate (electoral approval) to exercise aforementioned functions.

Definition
Caretaker governments may be put in place when a government in a parliamentary system is defeated in a motion of no confidence, or in the case when the house to which the government is responsible is dissolved, to be in place for an interim period until an election is held and a new government is formed. In this sense, in some countries which use a Westminster system of government, the caretaker government is simply the incumbent government, which continues to operate in the interim period between the normal dissolution of parliament for the purpose of holding an election and the formation of a new government after the election results are known. Unlike in ordinary times, the caretaker government's activities are limited by custom and convention.
In systems where coalition governments are frequent a caretaker government may be installed temporarily while negotiations to form a new coalition take place. This usually occurs either immediately after an election in which there is no clear victor or if one coalition government collapses and a new one must be negotiated. Caretaker governments are expected to handle daily issues and prepare budgets for discussion, but are not expected to produce a government platform or introduce controversial bills.
A caretaker government is often set up following a war until stable democratic rule can be restored, or installed, in which case it is often referred to as a provisional government.

Caretaker governments associated with elections
Many countries are administered by a caretaker government during election periods, such as:

Caretaker government of Australia
Caretaker government of Bangladesh
Caretaker government of Canada
Demissionary cabinet, a Dutch caretaker cabinet
Caretaker government of Malaysia
Caretaker government of Pakistan
Other countries that use similar mechanisms include Canada, and New Zealand.

Caretaker governments associated with wars or new regimes

Heads of caretaker governments are often referred to as a ""caretaker"" head, for example ""caretaker prime minister"".
Similarly, but chiefly in the United States, caretakers are individuals who fill seats in government temporarily without ambitions to continue to hold office on their own. This is particularly true with regard to United",politics
Capper–Volstead Act,"Capper–Volstead Act (P.L. 67-146), the Co-operative Marketing Associations Act (7 U.S.C. 291, 292) was adopted by the United States Congress on February 18, 1922. It gave “associations” of persons producing agricultural products certain exemptions from antitrust laws. It is sometimes called the Magna Carta of cooperatives.

Origins
The law was passed in response to challenges made  against cooperatives using the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Clayton Antitrust Act  (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.), and the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.). As a consequence of the depression of agricultural prices subsequent to World War I, farm organizations intensified their drive for government aid and managed to get a farm bloc established in Congress. Senator Arthur Capper was a member of this bloc and the Capper–Volstead Act was a part of the farm legislative program. (The law carries the names of its sponsors, Senator Arthur Capper of Kansas and Representative Andrew Volstead of Minnesota.)

Content
The act authorized various kinds of agricultural producers to form voluntary co-operative associations for purposes of producing, handling, and marketing farm products. It therefore exempted such associations from the application of the antitrust laws. The United States Secretary of Agriculture was given power, on his own motion, to prevent such associations from achieving and maintaining monopolies. He could hold hearings, determine facts, and issue orders, which were ultimately subject to review by federal district courts.

Ascribed characteristics,"Ascribed characteristics, as used in the social sciences, refers to properties of an individual attained at birth, by inheritance, or through the aging process. The individual has very little, if any, control over these characteristics. Typical examples include race, ethnicity, gender, caste, height, and appearance. The term is apt for describing characteristics chiefly caused by ""nature"" (e.g. genetics) and for those chiefly caused by ""nurture"" (e.g. parenting during early childhood), see: Nature versus nurture.

Use within demography
Demography being the statistical study of populations requires the ability to differentiate between populations. Most populations self-ascribe themselves as being different from others by the creation of a country. This allows demographers to draw lines between countries and compare them. However useful, countries have significant complex populations that require more exacting definitions. Commonly seen are uses of race, gender and ethnicity. In the scope of academic demography, all of these are social constructs, ascribed to groups or individuals for stratification. With these theories in place, many new theories can be formed and data collected to either prove or disprove them. Ascribed characteristics can have large by-products, whether perceived or not. Discussed below are race, gender, social status / caste and hiring / promotion.

Race
Ascribed characteristics are not always used for academic purposes. People with certain ascribed characteristics can be systematically treated with prejudice. Thus, the study of racism can be seen, at least superficially, as the study of the ways that people with a certain skin color and cultural background are systematically treated differently by society at large.

Gender
Frank van Tubergen studied the how ascribed characteristics and achieved characteristics affect their social capital in the article ""Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics"". The article highlighted that women have less social capital than men in Saudi Arabia citing specifically that it was ""due to fewer non-family connections"". There are many arguments that stem from disagreements over the definition of what is a fact when it comes to gender, showing the fluidity of ascribed characteristics. For example, people who find homosexuality morally objectionable may attempt to justify this by insisting that homosexuals make a conscious decision about the nature of the sexual desire they experience; however, it would difficult to condemn homosexuality if homosexuality was predetermined, either genetically or from early childhood. (See Sexual orientation.) Both groups do, however, use the term all the same, simply ascribing different definitions to those individuals.

Social status / caste
Many different societies have had varying types of social stratification both historically and in the modern era. One of the most obvious examples is India, and its caste system. In its",science
Louis Washkansky,"Louis Joshua Washkansky (12 April 1912 – 21 December 1967) was a South African man who was the recipient of the world's first human-to-human heart transplant, and the first patient to regain consciousness following the operation. Washkansky lived for 18 days and was able to speak with his wife and reporters.
Washkansky was the second human recipient of a heart transplant overall, in that James Hardy had done a transplant in 1964 in which Boyd Rush  received a chimpanzee's heart, although the patient in that case only survived an hour and did not regain consciousness.

Biography
Washkansky was a Lithuanian Jew, the youngest of the four children of Abe Washkansky and his wife, Chana Yentel Kemelgor. In 1912, when Washkansky was three months old, his father emigrated to South Africa without his family and started a business as a produce merchant. As a result of World War I and its aftermath, Chana and the children were not able to re-unite with Abe in Cape Town until 1923. Washkansky attended Cape Town High School, where he passed the standard eight, before entering the grocery business in Cape Town. He saw active service in World War II in East and North Africa and Italy.
Washkansky was an avid sportsman. He took part in football, swimming, and weightlifting. Later on in life, he suffered heart problems and required a heart transplant.

Medical background
Washkansky's health declined substantially: he was diabetic, and had an incurable heart disease, causing him to suffer three heart attacks. The last of these heart attacks led to congestive heart failure.
In April 1966, Washkansky visited Groote Schuur Hospital due to his pre-existing illness. He was first seen by Barry Kaplan, who in July 1966 had asked if Christiaan Barnard would be willing to treat Washkansky. Barnard had performed a number of laboratory tests and an in-depth examination on Washkansky and came to the conclusion that nothing could be done to help him. In January 1967, Washkansky was referred to Mervyn Gotsman, a cardiologist at the Cardiac Clinic in Groote Schuur Hospital, due to refractory heart failure. Washkansky underwent cardiac catheterisation confirming severe heart failure, and was subsequently referred to Barnard for possible surgery.
Washkansky was re-admitted to Groote Schuur on 14 September 1967, which was also the Jewish New Year. As a result of heart attacks in 1965, approximately only one third of his heart was still functioning. In late October, he went into a diabetic coma, but regained consciousness. Once, when he was swollen with fluid and in considerable pain, his wife Ann asked him in a whisper how he was doing. He managed a smile and whispered, ""I'm on top of the world."" He was also suffering from kidney and liver failure. On 10 November, Val Schrire put forward Washkansky as a possible heart transplant candidate.
When Barnard met with Washkansky, Barnard explained the possibility of a transplant and Washkansky was agreeable to the possibility. Afterwards, ",medicine
Economics of security,"The economics of information security addresses the economic aspects of privacy and computer security. Economics of information security includes models of the strictly rational “homo economicus” as well as behavioral economics. Economics of securities addresses individual and organizational decisions and behaviors with respect to security and privacy as market decisions.
Economics of security addresses a core question: why do agents choose technical risks when there exists technical solutions to mitigate security and privacy risks?  Economics addresses not only this question, but also inform design decisions in security engineering.

Emergence of economics of security
National security is the canonical public good. The economic status of information security came to the intellectual fore around 2000. As is the case with innovations it arose simultaneously in multiple venues.
In 2000, Ross Anderson wrote, Why Information Security is Hard.  Anderson explained that a significant difficulty in optimal development of security technology is that incentives must be aligned with the technology to enable rational adoption. Thus, economic insights should be integrated into technical design. A security technology should enable the party at risk to invest to limit that risk. Otherwise, the designers are simply counting on altruism for adoption and diffusion. Many consider this publication the birth of economics of security.
Also in 2000 at Harvard, Camp at the School of Government and Wolfram in the Department of Economics argued that security is not a public good but rather each extant vulnerabilities has an associated negative externality value.  Vulnerabilities were defined in this work as tradable goods. Six years later, iDEFENSE, ZDI and Mozilla have extant markets for vulnerabilities.
In 2000, the scientists at the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University proposed an early mechanism for risk assessment. The Hierarchical Holographic Model provided the first multi-faceted evaluation tool to guide security investments using the science of risk. Since that time, CERT has developed a suite of systematic mechanism for organizations to use in risk evaluations, depending on the size and expertise of the organization: OCTAVE. The study of computer security as an investment in risk avoidance has become standard practice.
In 2001, in an unrelated development, Lawrence A. Gordon and Martin P. Loeb published Using Information Security as a Response to Competitor Analysis System. A working paper of the published article was written in 2000. These professors, from Maryland's Smith School of Business, present a game-theoretic framework that demonstrates how information security can prevent rival firms from gaining sensitive information. In this context, the article considers the economic (i.e., cost-benefit) aspects of information security.

British Interregnum,"The interregnum in the British Isles began with the execution of Charles I in January 1649 (and from  September 1651 in Scotland) and ended in May 1660 when his son Charles II was restored to the thrones of the three realms, although he had been already acclaimed king in Scotland since 1649. During this time the monarchial system of government was replaced with the Commonwealth of England.
The precise start and end of the interregnum, as well as the social and political events that occurred during the interregnum, varied in the three kingdoms and the English dominions.

Prelude
After the Second English Civil War, the leadership of the New Model Army felt deeply betrayed by the King because they thought that while they had been negotiating in good faith he had duplicitously gone behind their backs in making The Engagement with the Scots and encouraging a new civil war. In April 1648, the Grandees of the Army met for a three-day meeting in Windsor Castle. At the end of the meeting, the Grandees accepted that it was their duty ""to call Charles Stuart, that man of blood, to an account for that blood he had shed, and mischief he had done"".
The Army and the Independents conducted ""Pride's Purge"" of the House of Commons removing their ill-wishers, and created a court for the trial and sentence of King Charles I. At the end of the trial the 59 Commissioners (judges) found Charles I guilty of high treason, as a ""tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy"". He was beheaded on a scaffold in front of the Banqueting House of the Palace of Whitehall on 30 January 1649.
The execution of Charles I ushered in the period known as the Interregnum. The reactions to the regicide and to subsequent events varied considerably between the three Kingdoms and the English Dominions.

England
Ireland
Scotland
After the execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649, the Scots declared his son king as Charles II. The English responded with an invasion led by Oliver Cromwell, resulting in defeats for the Scots at Dunbar in 1650 and then at Worcester 1651, opening the way for the English conquest of the country. The interregnum has been referred to as ""the Cromwellian ascendancy and military occupation of Scotland"" in the Oxford Companion to Scottish History  under the heading 'Restoration'.
Under the Tender of Union Scotland was declared part of a Commonwealth with England and Ireland in 1652, but despite repeated attempts, an act was not passed in Westminster to ratify the union until 1657. Under the terms of the union the Scots gained 30 members of parliament in the Protectorate (the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland), but many posts were not filled, or fell to English agents of the government, and had very little say at Westminster. Initially the government was run by eight commissioners and adopted a policy of undermining the political power of the nobility in favour of the ""meaner sort"". From 1655 it was replaced by a new Council of Scotland, headed by Irish peer L",history

George Washington's teeth,"George Washington, the first president of the United States, lost all but one of his teeth by the time he was inaugurated, and had at least four sets of dentures he used throughout his life. Made with brass, lead, gold, animal teeth and human teeth — possibly extracted from enslaved persons at Mount Vernon — the dentures were primarily created and attended to by John Greenwood, Washington's dentist.

Natural teeth
In 1756, when Washington was 24 years old, a dentist pulled his first tooth. According to his diary, he paid 5 shillings (£0.25, equivalent to $12 in 2024) to a ""Doctor Watson"" for the removal. His diary also regularly mentioned troubles such as aching teeth and lost teeth. John Adams said that Washington attributed the loss of his teeth to using them to crack walnuts, but modern historians have suggested that calomel, the mineral form of mercury(I) chloride which Washington was given to treat smallpox, probably contributed to the loss.
On April 30, 1789, the day of his first presidential inauguration, although he had mostly dentures, he had only one remaining natural tooth, a premolar. During that same year, he began wearing full dentures.
Washington's last tooth was given as a gift and keepsake to his dentist John Greenwood.

Dentures
During his life, George Washington had four sets of dentures. He began wearing partial dentures by 1781. Despite many people believing they were made of wood, they contained no wood, and often were made of teeth extracted from enslaved people and other materials, including hippopotamus ivory, brass, and gold. The dentures had metal fasteners, springs to force them open, as well as bolts to keep them together.
Records at Mount Vernon show that Washington bought teeth from slaves. These teeth were evidently intended for the use of French dentist Jean Pierre Le Mayeur in his dental practice. Whether they were used for Washington himself is unknown. The poor in the Western world had sold teeth as a means of making money since the Middle Ages, which were used as dentures or implants and sold to those of financial means. 
During the American Revolutionary War, Jean Pierre Le Mayeur provided services in tooth transplantation. In May of 1784, Washington paid several unnamed slaves 122 shillings (£6.10, equivalent to $190 in 2024) for a total of nine teeth to be implanted by a French doctor, who became a frequent guest on the plantation over the next few years. 
While it is unconfirmed that these purchased teeth were for Washington himself, his payment for them suggests that they were in fact for his use, as does a comment from a letter to his wartime clerk Richard Varick: ""I confess I have been staggered in my belief in the efficacy of transplantion,"" he wrote. Washington used teeth sourced from slaves to improve his appearance, a subject of frequent discomfort to him. However, scholars of the Mount Vernon estate dispute this, since the transactions in Washington's accounts state that they were bought ""on accoun",medicine
Dear Colleague letter,"A Dear Colleague letter is a letter sent by one member of a legislative body to all fellow members, usually describing a new bill and asking for cosponsors or seeking to influence the recipients' votes on an issue. They can also be used for administrative matters, such as announcing elevator repairs, or informing colleagues of events connected with congressional business, or to set or modify procedures.

Description
A typical ""Dear Colleague letter"" is written by staff members and will be approved by a Legislative Director as it represents a significant political communication by the member. Dear Colleague letters are short, typically no longer than 500 words.

Use
The use of such letters dates back to at least to the early 20th century. Electronic Dear Colleague letters are now disseminated via in-house networks in the US House and US Senate. Several agencies of the US government have also made use of ""Dear Colleague"" letters to disseminate information to the public and issue statements on public policy, including those of the Department of Transportation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. In UK government agencies such as the Department of Health, Dear Colleague letters convey general information, policy updates or a request for information or action.

Jianzi,"Jianzi (Chinese: 毽子; pinyin: jiànzi), is a traditional Chinese sport in which players aim to keep a heavily weighted shuttlecock in the air using their bodies apart from the hands, unlike in similar games such as peteca and indiaca. The primary origin of jianzi is an ancient Chinese game called Cuju, from the Han dynasty (202 BC – 9 AD, 25–220 AD). Jianzi is played on a badminton court using inner or outer lines in different competition settings. It can also be played artistically, among a circle of players in a street or park, with the objective to keep the shuttle 'up' and show off skills. In Vietnam, it is known as đá cầu, and it is the national sport. In the Philippines, it is known as sipa and was also the national sport, until it was replaced by arnis in December 2009.
The game has also gained a following around the globe. In English, both the sport and the object with which it is played are referred to as a ""shuttlecock"" or ""featherball"". In Malaysia, the game is known as capteh, or chapteh. It is considered a game played by children until they can master sepak raga.

Gameplay
The shuttlecock (called a jianzi in the Chinese game, or 'Chinese hacky sack' and 'kinja' in English) typically has four feathers fixed into a rubber sole or a plastic disc. Some handmade jianzis make use of a washer or a coin with a hole in the centre.
During play, any part of the body except for the hands can be used to keep the shuttlecock from touching the ground. It is primarily balanced and propelled upwards using parts of the leg, especially the feet. Skilled players may employ an overhead kick.
In China, the sport usually has two playing forms:

Circle kick among 5-10 people
Duel kick between two kickers or two sides.
The circle kick uses upward kicks only when keeping the shuttlecock from touching the ground. The duel kick has become popular among younger Chinese players, and uses ""flat kick"" techniques like goal shooting techniques in football. The ""powerful flat kick"" techniques are applied in Chinese games as a major attacking kill.

Competitive play
Competitively, the government-run game is called ""Hacky-Sack (jianqiu 毽球)"" and is played on a rectangular court 6.10 by 11.88 meters, divided by a net (much like badminton) at a height of 1.60 meters (1.50 meters for women).
A new style of Ti Jian Zi called ""Chinese JJJ"" was introduced in 2009.  ""JJJ"" stands for ""Competitive Jianzi-kicking"" in Chinese with the three Chinese characters ""竞技毽"" all starting with ""J"". This version uses a lower middle net at 90 cm, and the inner or outside lines of the standard badminton court.

Non-competitive play
There are several variations of the game, such as trying to keep the shuttlecock in the air until an agreed number of kicks (e.g. 100) is reached, either alone or in a pair. In circle play, the aim may be simply to keep play going. In all but the most competitive formats, a skillful display is a key component of play.

Environmental security,"Environmental security examines threats posed by environmental events and trends to individuals, communities or nations. It may focus on the impact of human conflict and international relations on the environment, or on how environmental problems cross state borders.

General
The Millennium Project assessed definitions of environmental security and created a synthesis definition:
Environmental security is environmental viability for life support, with three sub-elements: 

preventing or repairing military damage to the environment,
preventing or responding to environmentally caused conflicts, and
protecting the environment due to its inherent moral value.
It considers the abilities of individuals, communities or nations to cope with environmental risks, changes or conflicts, or limited natural resources. For example, climate change can be viewed a threat to environmental security (see the article climate security for more nuance to the discussion.) Human activity impacts CO2 emissions, impacting regional and global climatic and environmental changes and thus changes in agricultural output. This can lead to food shortages which will then cause political debate, ethnic tension, and civil unrest.
Environmental security is an important concept in three fields: international relations and international development and human security.
Within international development, projects may aim to improve aspects of environmental security such as food security or water security, but also connected aspects such as energy security, that are now recognised as Sustainable Development Goals at UN level. Targets for MDG 7 about environmental sustainability show international priorities for environmental security. Target 7B is about the security of fisheries on which many people depend for food. Fisheries are an example of a resource that cannot be contained within state borders. A conflict before the International Court of Justice between Chile and Peru about maritime borders and their associated fisheries is a case study for environmental security.

History
The Copenhagen School defines the referent object of environmental security as the environment, or some strategic part of it.
Historically, the definition of international security has varied over time. After World War II, definitions typically focused on the subject of realpolitik that developed during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.
As tensions between the superpowers eased after the collapse of the Soviet Union, academic discussions of definitions of security significantly expanded, particularly including environmental threats associated with the political implications of resource use or pollution. By the mid-1980s, this field of study was becoming known as ""environmental security"". Despite a wide range of semantic and academic debates over terms, it is now widely acknowledged that environmental factors play both direct and indirect roles in both political disputes and violent confl",politics

History of Vojvodina,"Vojvodina (Serbian: Војводина or Vojvodina; Hungarian: Vajdaság; Slovak: Vojvodina; Romanian: Voivodina; Croatian: Vojvodina; Rusyn: Войводина) is an autonomous province located in northern Serbia. It consists of the Pannonian Plain in the south, and the Danube and Sava  (part of the Mačva region that belongs to Vojvodina is located south of Sava) rivers in the north.

Etymology
The name ""Vojvodina"" (Војводина) in the Serbian language simply means ""voivodeship"" or ""duchy"". Its original historical name in 1848 was ""Serbian Voivodeship"" (Serbian Vojvodina). The Serbian language uses two more varieties of the word Vojvodina. These varieties are Vojvodovina (Војводовина), and Vojvodstvo (Војводство), the latter being an equivalent to the Polish word for province, województwo (voivodeship).
As for the names of the three historical and geographical regions of which Vojvodina is composed, Syrmia was named after the ancient Roman city of Sirmium, Bačka was named after the town of Bač, and Banat was named after the ruling title Ban.

Territory of present-day Vojvodina throughout history
Banat, Bačka and Syrmia: Throughout history, the territory of present-day Vojvodina (including regions of Banat, Bačka and Syrmia) has been (entirely or partially) a part of:

Convertible husbandry,"Convertible husbandry, also known as alternate husbandry or up-and-down husbandry, is a method of farming whereby strips of arable farmland were temporarily converted into grass pasture, known as leys. These remained under grass for up to 10 years before being ploughed under again, while some eventually became permanent pasturage. It was a process used during the 16th century through the 19th century by ""which a higher proportion of land was used to support increasing numbers of livestock in many parts of England."" Its adoption was an important component of the British Agricultural Revolution. 
Ley farming, a similar system of growing fodder on fallow plots of arable land, remains in use today.

Description
Convertible husbandry was a process that consisted of keeping arable land fallow for long periods as pasture for livestock. This system utilized fertilizer in the form of animal manure. Fertilizer was used in greater quantities due to the increase in animal husbandry and resulted in benefiting crop yields when it was time for tillage. Farmers sowed specific grass seeds to control the quality of their pasture.

Historical context
Before the 16th and 17th centuries, most farmlands in Britain used simple alternations of tilling and fallowing during different seasons over several years, while livestock was often kept on less productive land and commons. However, in the Midlands the rising population, density of settlements, lack of new areas into which cultivation could expand, and the 15th century enclosures of sheep flocks, led to a system of agriculture with increasing numbers of livestock. A possible factor that influenced the adoption of convertible husbandry was the changing skill levels of workers. In the words of historian Eric Kerridge, the combination of ""floating of water-meadows, the substitution of up-and-down husbandry for permanent tillage and permanent grass or for shifting cultivation, the introduction of new fallow crops and selected grasses, marsh drainage, manuring, and stock breeding"" were essential innovations of the British Agricultural Revolution.
Although often praised as increasing yields and efficiency, this is debatable. Yields were often poor in the late Middle Ages and approximately equivalent to regular common fields. It was not always adaptable to the type of land or soil at all locations. Kitsikopoulos argues it was the introduction of fodder legumes, such as clover, in the early modern period which eventually truly achieved greater agricultural productivity. 
Although debatable, many agricultural historians also believe that the introduction of convertible husbandry was brought about with the introduction of the turnip. They argue that ""the lowly turnip made possible a change in crop rotation which did not require much capital, but which brought about a tremendous rise in agricultural productivity."" They believe that this ""fodder"" crop pushed agriculture in a direction in which ""alternating"" husbandry was seen as ",economics
Criminology,"Criminology (from Latin crimen, 'accusation', and Ancient Greek -λογία, -logia, from λόγος logos, 'word, reason') is the interdisciplinary study of crime and deviant behaviour. Criminology is a multidisciplinary field in both the behavioural and social sciences, which draws primarily upon the research of sociologists, political scientists, economists, legal sociologists, psychologists, philosophers, psychiatrists, social workers, biologists, social anthropologists, scholars of law and jurisprudence, as well as the processes that define administration of justice and the criminal justice system.
The interests of criminologists include the study of nature of crime and criminals, origins of criminal law, etiology of crime, social reaction to crime, and the functioning of law enforcement agencies and the penal institutions. It can be broadly said that criminology directs its inquiries along three lines: first, it investigates the nature of criminal law and its administration and conditions under which it develops; second, it analyzes the causation of crime and the personality of criminals; and third, it studies the control of crime and the rehabilitation of offenders. Thus, criminology includes within its scope the activities of legislative bodies, law-enforcement agencies, judicial institutions, correctional institutions and educational, private and public social agencies.

History of academic criminology
Modern academic criminology has direct roots in the 19th-century Italian School of ""criminal anthropology"", which according to the historian Mary Gibson ""caused a radical refocusing of criminological discussion throughout Europe and the United States from law to the criminal. While this 'Italian School' was in turn attacked and partially supplanted in countries such as France by 'sociological' theories of delinquency, they retained the new focus on the criminal."" According to Gibson, the term criminology was most likely coined in 1885 by Italian law professor Raffaele Garofalo as Criminologia. In the late 19th century, French anthropologist Paul Topinard used the analogous French term Criminologie.
Criminology grew substantially as a discipline in the first quarter of the twentieth century. From 1900 through to 2000 this field of research underwent three significant phases in the United States: (1) Golden Age of Research (1900–1930) which has been described as a multiple-factor approach, (2) Golden Age of Theory (1930–1960) which endeavored to show the limits of systematically connecting criminological research to theory, and (3) a 1960–2000 period, which was seen as a significant turning point for criminology.

Early Schools of Thought
There were three main schools of thought in early criminological theory, spanning the period from the mid-18th century to the mid-twentieth century: Classical, Positivist, and Chicago. These schools of thought were superseded by several contemporary paradigms of criminology, such as the sub-culture, control, strain, ",science
Thomas Desmond Hawkins,"Thomas Desmond Hawkins, known as Desmond Hawkins, (22 May 1923 – 2 January 2015) was the dean of Cambridge University’s school of clinical medicine between 1979 and 1984, and a pioneer of interventional neuroradiology. While studying medicine at St. Mary's Hospital, he assisted at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as a voluntary medical student.

African humid period,"The African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth's axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.
During the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.
The AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Deserts, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.

Research history
Herodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.

Brazilian jiu-jitsu,"Brazilian jiu-jitsu (Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro [ʒiw ˈʒitsu bɾaziˈlejɾu, ʒu -]), often abbreviated to BJJ, is a self-defense system, martial art, and combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting, and submission holds. It is primarily a ground-based fighting style and focuses on taking one's opponent down to the ground, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks, chokeholds, or compression locks. It has its roots in traditional Japanese jiu-jitsu.
Brazilian jiu-jitsu was first developed around 1925 by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., and Hélio Gracie, after Carlos was taught Kodokan judo by a travelling Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, in 1917. Later on the Gracie family developed their own self-defense system which they named Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. BJJ eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and adaptation of Gracie jiu-jitsu and judo, and has become one of the essential martial arts for modern MMA.
BJJ revolves around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them. Sparring, commonly referred to as ""rolling"" within the BJJ community, and live drilling plays a major role in the practitioner's development. In contrast to some other martial arts BJJ can be practiced both using a gi uniform or not which is known as 'no-gi BJJ', for this purpose rash guards are used. The International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF) is the main governing body of the martial art, establishing the rules and general guidelines, as well as promoting competitions and training of referees. BJJ can also be used as a method of promoting physical fitness, building character, and as a way of life.

Principle
While grappling such as judo or wrestling mainly uses upperbody strength to hold and throw or subdue the opponent, this is a martial art that uses the legs to wrap around the opponent. The opponent is subdued by wrapping the legs around the neck, shoulders, torso, hips, thighs. By applying weight, push, pull, or rotate, mainly from leg wrapping with some upperbody strength.
Since the core of Jiu-Jitsu is leg wrapping, when you meet an opponent who has trained Jiu-Jitsu and also want to compete them in a grappling way, firstly subdue one of your opponent's legs to prevent him wrapping his leg, it will make them difficult to exert force.
Also, since the goal of Jiu-Jitsu is to create a so-called 2 on 1 situations where you use your own two arms to subdue others one arm or wrap the opponent's entire body with your legs, it is better to prevent such situations in advance.
In the case where an opponent had already his legs wrapped around your torso, which is a common situation in Jiu-Jitsu, it is easy to escape by applying force to one side of the",sports

Peak wheat,"Peak wheat is the concept that agricultural production, due to its high use of water and energy inputs, is subject to the same profile as oil and other fossil fuel production.  The central tenet is that a point is reached, the ""peak"", beyond which agricultural production plateaus and does not grow any further,  and may even go into permanent decline.
Based on supply and demand factors for agricultural commodities (e.g., changing diets in the emerging economies, biofuels, declining acreage under irrigation, growing global population, stagnant agricultural productivity growth), some commentators between 2007 and 2009 predicted a long-term annual production shortfall of around 2% which, based on the highly inelastic demand curve for food crops, could lead to sustained price increases in excess of 10% a year – sufficient to double crop prices in seven years. However, at that time according to the World Resources Institute, global per capita food production had been increasing substantially for the past several decades.

China
Water is a necessary input for food production. Two billion people face acute water shortage this century as Himalayan glaciers melt. Water shortages in China have helped lower the wheat harvest from its peak of 123 million tons in 1997 to below 100 million tons in recent years, but by 2020 production is back to 134 Mt.
Of China's 617 cities, 300 are facing water shortages. In many, these shortfalls can be filled only by diverting water from agriculture. Farmers are unable to compete economically with industry for water in China.  China is developing a grain deficit even with the over-pumping of its aquifers. Grain production in China has been said to have peaked in 1998 at 392 million tons, falling below 350 million tons in 2000, 2001, and 2002, although such was 571 million tons in 2011 after eight consecutive years of increase from 2003 to 2011. The annual deficits have been filled by drawing down the country's extensive grain reserves, and by reliance on the world grain market. Some predict that China will soon become the world's largest importer of grain.
Figures from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) contradict many claims that the country's wheat supply is unstable. According to USDA, in 2014 China imported 1.5 million tonnes (MT) of wheat, and had relatively small exports of 1 MT. However, China produced 126 MT of wheat in 2014, according to the same source. For comparison, Egypt was 2014's largest importer, with imports of 10.7 MT. If China had imported more than Egypt, it still would have produced more than 10 times more wheat than it would import, while in fact it produced more than 100 times more.

Farmers Weekly,"Farmers Weekly is a magazine aimed at the British farming industry. It provides news; business features; a weekly digest of facts and figures about British, European and world agriculture; and livestock, arable and machinery sections with reports on technical developments, farm sales and analysis of prices. It has both charted and captured agricultural changes. It has been vocal in its advocacy for the farming sector.

History and profile
The first issue of The Farmers Weekly was on 22 June 1934, costing 2d. It claimed to be a newspaper of the soil and aimed to increase agricultural production in the United Kingdom. It has captured and charted agricultural changes. It was acquired by Edward George Warris Hulton in 1937. The magazine is published weekly on Fridays, typically 51 times per year. Farmers Weekly has published books including Farmhouse Fare (1935) and Home Made Country Wines (1955), both consisting of recipes contributed by readers of the magazine.
In the 1930s, Farmers Weekly average circulation per issue was 100,000 copies. In 2004, it had an average circulation of 77,233; by 2013, this had fallen to 59,328; in 2018, average circulation was 44,023 per issue.
On 4 May 1951 it published a double-page spread on the changes in one hundred years of farming between 1851 and the Great Exhibition and 1951 the Festival of Britain. In the article it made the case for farming to be seen as a modern industry and a public good. It also made the case for national recognition for the hard-working countryside people.
Farmers Weekly Interactive (FWi) is the online home of Farmers Weekly, with 623,231 unique visitors per month visiting the FWi website.

Plantas alimentícias não convencionais,"Plantas alimentícias não convencionais, known by the acronym PANC, is an academic and popular movement in Brazil in favor of propagating and foraging for unconventional edible plants. The name, translating to Non-conventional Food Plants, refers to species with food potential that are not consumed on a large scale (such as Victoria amazonica), or to parts that are not usually consumed in common plants (such as sweet potato leaves).

History
Due to the advances in modern agriculture and changes in cuisine, some plants that were commonly grown or foraged are no longer used. Most PANCs are native species that are resistant to pests, need little care, and can be grown in unconventional places, such as roadsides or vacant lots.
The term PANC was coined by professor, researcher, and botanist Valdely Kinupp in his PhD thesis at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. The term is variable, and a plant that is widely consumed within Brazil can be considered a PANC outside of it, and vice versa. This difference is also regional.
In 2010, the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture released the Manual de hortaliças não convencionais (Manual of non-conventional vegetables). This book compiled 23 vegetable species with edible parts, and assists in the use and partial identification of PANCs.

Examples
Basella alba can be eaten sautéed, cooked or raw.
Maranta arundinacea has rhizomatous stems from which a starch can be extracted.
Tropaeolum majus is entirely edible above ground, including the seeds.

Early modern period,"The early modern period is a historical period that is defined either as part of or as immediately preceding the modern period, with divisions based primarily on the history of Europe and the broader concept of modernity. There is no exact date that marks the beginning or end of the period and its extent may vary depending on the area of history being studied. In general, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from around the start of the 16th century to the start of the 19th century (about 1500–1800). In a European context, it is defined as the period following the Middle Ages and preceding the advent of modernity; but the dates of these boundaries are far from universally agreed. In the context of global history, the early modern period is often used even in contexts where there is no equivalent ""medieval"" period.
Various events and historical transitions have been proposed as the start of the early modern period, including the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the start of the Renaissance, the end of the Crusades, the Reformation in Germany giving rise to Protestantism and the beginning of the Age of Discovery and with it the onset of the first wave of European colonization. Its end is often marked by the French Revolution, and sometimes also the American Revolution or Napoleon's rise to power, with the advent of the second wave modern colonization of New Imperialism.
Historians in recent decades have argued that, from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its spreading globalizing character. New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the period. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of mercantilism as an economic theory. Other notable trends of the period include the development of experimental science, increasingly rapid technological progress, secularized civic politics, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, and the emergence of nation states.

Definition
The early modern period is a subdivision of the most recent of the three major periods of European history: antiquity, the Middle Ages and the modern period. The term ""early modern"" was first proposed by medieval historian Lynn Thorndike in his 1926 work A Short History of Civilization as a broader alternative to the Renaissance. It was first picked up within the field of economic history during the 1940s and 1950s and gradually spread to other historians in the following decades and became widely known among scholars during the 1990s.

Overview
At the onset of the early modern period, trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. Feudalism declined in Europe, and Christendom saw the end of the Crusades and of religious unity in Western Europe under the Roman Catholic Church. The old order was destabilized by the Protestant Refor",history
Alex Paton (physician),"Alexander Paton (2 March 1924 – 12 September 2015) was a British gastroenterologist, writer and postgraduate dean for North-West London hospitals, who was a specialist in alcohol misuse.
In 1945, while studying medicine at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School, Paton was one of the London medical students who volunteered to go to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp shortly after its liberation by British troops, to assist in administering the ""starvation diet"" to the severely malnourished and dying inmates.
Paton was one of the first intake of doctors into the British National Health Service and later became a registrar to Sheila Sherlock, a recognised authority on liver disease. In 1959, he was appointed consultant physician to Dudley Road Hospital, Birmingham, where he taught medical students for the MRCP, established an endoscopy service and began a 20-year study of the effects of alcoholic liver cirrhosis.
Paton later held consultant positions at the St Ann's Hospital and the Prince of Wales Hospital in North London, and became the first chairman of the medical committee of Alcohol Concern. His book, ABC of Alcohol, went through four editions.

Early life
Alexander Paton was born on 2 March 1924 in Allahabad, India. His father, also called Alex, was an army colonel who had been awarded the Military Cross. His mother, Isabel Sybil Emma Grimwood Mears was the daughter of Sir Edward Grimwood Mears, chief justice of the High Court of Allahabad.
After completing his early education at Alleyn Court Prep School, Essex, he gained a scholarship to Canford School in Dorset and subsequently gained admission to study medicine at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School, London during The Blitz.

Belsen
Paton was one of the London medical students who were sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, shortly after its liberation by the British troops, to assist Arnold Peter Meiklejohn in administering what was known as the ""starvation diet"" to the severely malnourished and dying inmates. Many of these inmates had such advanced malnutrition that they were intolerant of large, highly nutritious meals and the diet comprised small, frequent, bland meals which were much better tolerated.
In his memoirs, published in the British Medical Journal in 1981, he described how on 4 April 1945 there was a proposed trip to Holland for 12 St Thomas's students. He put his name down and on 12 April was at the Hotel Grand Central at Marylebone collecting his kit. After a briefing by Richard Doll, explaining how they were to feed the starving Dutch with an experimental mixture, they were asked to ""keep detailed records"".
On 28 April, they were informed that the destination had changed to Belsen and they were rushed to Cirencester, where they spent three “frustrating” days. He recalled how the newspapers had already announced that “100 students from nine London medical schools are being rushed to Germany”. They arrived in Belsen on 2 May 1945 and on the following day began to clea",medicine
Telecommunications in Jamaica,"Telecommunications in Jamaica include the fixed and mobile telephone networks, radio, television, and the Internet.

Telecommunications
Jamaica is a member of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). The NANP Administrator (NANPA) has allocated the area codes 876 and 658 for use in the country, which is a single numbering plan area (NPA) with an overlay numbering plan. The national telephone number format is NPA-NXX-XXXX, where N is one of the digits 2 through 9, and X is any digit.
For international dialing to Jamaica, the country code is 1.
For accessing international destinations from within Jamaica, the international call prefix is 011.
Calls from Jamaica to other NANP nations, such as the U.S. and Canada, are dialed as 1 + NANP area code + 7-digit number.
Jamaica has a fully digital telephone communication system.

Main lines: 265,000 lines in use, 123rd in the world (2011).
Mobile cellular: 2.7 million, 135th in the world (2012).
Telephone system: Fully automatic domestic telephone network; the 1999 agreement to open the market for telecommunications services resulted in rapid growth in mobile-cellular telephone usage while the number of fixed-lines in use declined (2011).
Teledensity: 110 per 100 persons (combined) (2011).
Satellite earth stations: 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2010).
Communication cables: Fibralink submarine cable links to the Americas Region Caribbean Ring System (ARCOS-1) submarine cable in the Dominican Republic and on to the US, parts of the Caribbean, Central and South America; the ALBA-1 fiber-optic submarine cable links Jamaica, Cuba, and Venezuela (2010).

Mobile telephony
The country's three mobile operators – Cable and Wireless (once marketed as LIME – Landline, Internet, Mobile and Entertainment now named FLOW), Digicel, and at one point Oceanic Digital (operating as MiPhone and now known as Claro since late 2008) until the carrier was acquired and the relevant spectrum sold to Digicel  – have spent millions in network upgrade and expansion. Both Digicel and Oceanic Digital were granted licences in 2001 to operate mobile services in the newly liberalised telecom market that had once been the sole domain of the incumbent Cable and Wireless monopoly. Digicel opted for the more widely used GSM wireless system, while Oceanic opted for the CDMA standard. Cable and Wireless, which had begun with TDMA standard, subsequently upgraded to GSM, and currently utilises both standards on its network.
With wireless usage increasing, landlines supplied by Cable and Wireless have declined from just over half a million to roughly three hundred thousand as of 2006. In a bid to grab more market share, Cable and Wireless recently launched a new land line service called HomeFone Prepaid that would allow customers to pay for minutes they use rather than pay a set monthly fee for service, much like prepaid wireless service.

Trugo,"Trugo, alternatively TruGo or True-Go, is an Australian sport where a rubber ring is struck with a mallet so that it passes between a set of posts. The game was developed in the western suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. The first trugo clubs were established in 1930s with the governing body of the sport, the Victorian Trugo Association (VTA), formed in 1940 by four clubs: Footscray, Yarraville, Newport and Williamstown.
The game was traditionally played by senior citizens over 60 years of age as it was conceived as a gentle game for pensioners to maintain social contact after retiring from employment. However, since the 1990s, the game has been progressively opened up to all ages and is now promoted as a cross generational sport.
At the start of the 2020 season, the principal trugo teams are Ascot Vale, Brunswick, Brunswick City, Footscray Doughnuts, Footscray Gumnuts, Port Melbourne, Sandridge, South Melbourne and Yarraville.
While the sport is rarely covered by the mainstream media, from time-to-time trugo has featured in reports covering its unique history and the quirky niche it occupies in Melbourne's sporting culture. For example, in January 2009 the sport was featured on the American TV travel show Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations and The Age in 2020 provided a video report describing the game as ""Melbourne's own working-class sport"".

Play
Played outdoors on a grass court similar to that used for lawn bowls, courts measure 90 feet (27 meters) in length and 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 meters) wide. The object of the game is to score goals by striking a rubber ring one inch thick and thirteen inches in circumference with a mallet through a pair of short goal posts at the opposite end of the court. Rings are launched from a thick rubber plate and goal posts are hinged so that they fall if struck by the ring. When a post is struck it is judged a no-goal or 'poster' and no points are awarded. Behind the goal the player's opponent acts as a catcher using a canvas bag attached to a long pole to ensure the ring is safely contained. It is also the role of the catcher to call out the score for recording by both sides and to adjudicate any near goals.
Games may be played as singles, doubles, fours or eights. VTA premiership rounds are played as eights with four playing the first half and the remaining four playing the second half. Each player has three innings of four shots each before their opponents reply from the opposite end. At the end of the quarter, teams swap ends and play an additional three innings for a total of 24 shots per player. The team with the most goals at the end of the playing period is declared the winner.
The most common technique for striking the ring is called tunnelling: the player stands facing away from the goals, feet either side of the plate; the short-handled mallet is then swung between the player's legs to strike the ring. The less common technique, used in the early years and more common in the women's version of the game",sports
Technological determinism,"Technological determinism is a reductionist theory in assuming that a society's technology progresses by following its own internal logic of efficiency, while determining the development of the social structure and cultural values. The term is believed to have originated from Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), an American sociologist and economist. The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely Clarence Ayres who was a follower of Thorstein Veblen as well as John Dewey. William Ogburn was also known for his radical technological determinism and his theory on cultural lag.

Origin
The origins of technological determinism as a formal concept are often traced to Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), an influential American sociologist and economist. Veblen, known for his work on social and economic issues, introduced ideas that portrayed technology as a powerful, autonomous force capable of shaping societal norms and structures. He argued that the development and use of machinery exerted an independent influence on human thought and behavior, notably asserting that ""the machine throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought.” This notion laid the foundation for technological determinism by suggesting that technology inherently transforms society by reshaping patterns of thought and behavior.

Historical Context and Influences
During Veblen's time, rapid industrialization and advancements in technology were radically altering American society. Innovations in manufacturing and transportation, such as the assembly line and railroads, demonstrated technology’s potential to reshape economic and social structures. These changes helped popularize the idea that technology could independently drive societal evolution, creating the conditions for Veblen's ideas to resonate widely.

Influence of Karl Marx and Expansion by Clarence Ayres
Although Veblen is credited with coining the core ideas behind technological determinism, the influence of Karl Marx on these ideas is also significant. Marx argued that technology drives historical change by shaping the ""material base"" of society. For instance, he suggested that the railway in colonial India would challenge and erode the caste system by introducing new economic activities and altering social hierarchies. Later, Clarence Ayres, a 20th-century economist inspired by Veblen, expanded on these ideas by introducing the concept of ""technological drag."" According to Ayres, technology progresses as a dynamic, self-generating force, while traditional institutions often lag, resisting the transformative potential of technological change. Ayres’ theory further solidified technological determinism, emphasizing the inevitable clash between technological progress and social conservatism.

Explanation
Technological determinism seeks to show technical developments, media, or technology as a whole, as the key mover in history and social change. It is a theory subscribed to by ""hyperglobalis",technology
Burgenland,"Burgenland (German pronunciation: [ˈbʊʁɡn̩lant] ; Hungarian: Őrvidék; Croatian: Gradišće; Austro-Bavarian: Burgnland; Slovene: Gradiščanska; Slovak: Hradsko) is the easternmost and least populous state of Austria. It consists of two statutory cities and seven rural districts, with a total of 171 municipalities. It is 166 km (103 mi) long from north to south but much narrower from west to east (5 km (3.1 mi) wide at Sieggraben). The region is part of the Centrope Project. The name of Burgenland was invented/coined in 1922, after its territories became part of Austria. The population of Burgenland as of 1 January 2024 is 301,951. Burgenland's capital is Eisenstadt.

History
The territory of present-day Burgenland was successively part of the Roman Empire, the Hun Empire, the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths, the Italian Kingdom of Odoacer, the Kingdom of the Lombards, the Avar Khaganate, the Frankish Empire, Dominion Aba belonging to the Aba (family); Aba – Koszegi, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Habsburg monarchy, the Austrian Empire, Austria-Hungary, and lastly Austria.
Burgenland is the only Austrian province which has never been part of the Archduchy of Austria, Holy Roman Empire, German Confederation nor Austria-Hungary's Cisleithania.

Prehistory and antiquity
From the 4th century BC, the area was dominated by Celts and in the 1st century AD it became part of the Roman Empire. During Roman administration, it was part of the province of Pannonia, and later part of the provinces of Pannonia Superior (in the 2nd century) and Pannonia Prima (in the 3rd century). During the late Roman Empire, Pannonia Prima province was part of larger administrative units, such are Diocese of Pannonia, Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum and Praetorian prefecture of Italy.

Early Germanic states
The first Germanic people to settle in this region were the Ostrogoths, who came to Pannonia in AD 380. The Ostrogoths became allies of Rome and were allowed to settle in Pannonia, being tasked to defend the Roman borders. In the 5th century, the area was conquered by the Huns, but after their defeat, an independent Kingdom of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia was formed. The territory of present-day Burgenland became part of the Italian Kingdom of Odoacer, but at the end of the 5th century the Ostrogothic king Theodoric conquered this kingdom and restored Ostrogothic administration in western Pannonia.
In the 6th century, the territory was included in another Germanic state, the Kingdom of the Lombards. However, the Lombards subsequently left towards Italy and the area came under the control of the Avars. For a brief period in the 7th century, the area became part of the Slavic State of Samo, however it subsequently came back under Avar control. After the Avar defeat at the end of the 8th century, the area became part of the Frankish Empire. After the Battle of Lechfeld (or Augsburg) in 955, new Germanic settlers came to the area.

Cartel party theory,"In politics, a cartel party or cartel political party is a party which uses the resources of the state to maintain its position within the political system, colluding with other parties in a way similar to a cartel. The premise is that the parties do not compete with one another (being ""post-political""), but rather collude to protect their collective interests and keep small outsider parties from being viable.
Richard Katz and Peter Mair argue that ""parties in Western Europe have adapted themselves to declining levels of participation and involvement in party activities by not only turning to resources provided by the state but by doing so in a collusive manner"".

Concept
The concept of the cartel party was first proposed in 1992 as a means of drawing attention to the patterns of inter-party collusion or cooperation rather than competition; and as a way of emphasising  the influence of the state on party development.  In definitional terms, the cartel party is a type of party that emerges in advanced democratic polities and that is characterised by the interpenetration of party and state and by a pattern of inter-party collusion.  With the development of the cartel party, the goals of politics become self-referential, professional and technocratic, and what little inter-party competition remains becomes focused on the efficient and effective management of the polity. The election campaigns that are conducted by cartel parties are capital-intensive, professionalized and centralized, and are organized on the basis of a strong reliance on the state for financial subventions and for other benefits and privileges. Within the party, the distinction between party members and non-members becomes blurred, in that through primaries, electronic polling, and so on, the parties invite all of their supporters, members or not, to participate in party activities and decision-making.  Above all, with the emergence of cartel parties, politics becomes increasingly depoliticised.

Contrast with mass parties
The cartel party is contrasted with the traditional view of the mass party, where political parties organize around the issues of large numbers of people. Mass parties are often linked to specific groups with specific policy needs and compete in elections to advance their constituents needs. Mass parties traditionally had little formal support from the government and were largely financed and organized from civil society. In Western Europe the growth of socialist parties in the 19th and early 20th century are traditionally linked to the growth of mass parties, who emerged in working class communities to advance issues like universal suffrage and labor reform.

Reasons for growth
Decline of mass parties
The mass party as an organizational model declined in many countries in the later 20th century due to political parties' gradual moderation of policy ideas and breakdown of traditional group identities. Party membership has been in decline in many democracies, whic",politics
Clientelism,"Clientelism or client politics is the exchange of goods and services for political support, often involving an implicit or explicit quid-pro-quo. It is closely related to patronage politics and vote buying.
Clientelism involves an asymmetric relationship between groups of political actors described as patrons, brokers, and clients. In client politics, an organized interest group benefits at the expense of the public. Client politics may have a strong interaction with the dynamics of identity politics. This is particularly common in an elite pluralist or rigidly duopolistic system, such as in the United States, where lobbying can have considerable power shaping public policy. The opposite of client politics is entrepreneurial politics, or conviction politics. Although many definitions for clientelism have been proposed, according to the political scientist Allen Hicken, it is generally thought that there are four key elements of clientelistic relationships:

Dyadic relationships: Simply, these are two-way relationships.
Contingency: Delivery of a service to a citizen by a politician or broker is contingent on the citizen's actions on behalf of the politician or party through which they are receiving services.
Hierarchy: The politician or party is in a higher position of power than the citizen.
Iteration: The relationship is not a one-off exchange, but rather, ongoing.
Contingency and iteration are the two components shared across most definitions of clientelism.

Origins
The origin of the practice has been traced to ancient Rome. Here relationships between the patron (patronus) and client (cliens) were seen as crucial to understanding the political process. While the obligations between these were mutual, the key point is they were hierarchical. These relationships might be best viewed not as an entity but rather as a network (clientela), with the patronus himself perhaps being obligated to someone of greater power, and the cliens perhaps having more than one patron. These extensions increase the possibilities of conflicting interests arising. While the familia was the basic unit underlying Roman society, the interlocking networks (clientela) acted as restrictions on their autonomy but allowed a more complex society to develop. Historians of the late medieval period evolved the concept into bastard feudalism. There is, as is usual, ambiguity in the use of political terminology and the terms ""clientelism"", the ""patron–client relationship"", ""patronage"", and the political machine are sometimes used to describe similar or related concepts.
The reigns of Julius Caesar (49–44 BCE) and Tiberius (14–16 AD) have been characterized as examples of widespread clientelism. In the 1500s, French political theorist Étienne de La Boétie did not use the term clientelism, but described the practice of emperors who used gifts to the public to gain loyalty from those who were eager to accept what amounted to bribery:

Tejo (Argentina),"Tejo (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈte.xo]) is a precision sport in the family of the Bocce and the petanque. Tejo can be played by men and women of all ages.

History
The sport was born as a beach game on the coast of Argentina in the mid-nineteenth century. Over the years, it spread across Argentina and neighboring countries. It was elected in 2015 by the Ministry of Sports of the Argentine nation as an indigenous sport for the transplanted Olympics carried out in the city of Mar Del Plata and since 2018 is organized worldwide by the International Association of Tejo (AIT).

Gameplay
Tejo is played between two opposing teams. They play by throwing a series of small discs called tejos (they have two different colours, one for each team) in a rectangular field. They try to score points, winning with 12 (traditionally 15).

One team scores a point for each of its tejos that are nearer a small and neutral tejo, which is called tejin, than the nearest tejo of the opposing team, once all the tejos are played.
The playing field covers 2.5 by 12 meters (8 ft 2 in × 39 ft 4 in) divided in two equal parts.
The traditional surface of the game is sand and can contain land up to 20%.

Involuntary hospitalization of Joyce Brown,"Joyce Patricia Brown (1947 – November 29, 2005), also known as Billie Boggs, was a homeless woman who was forcibly hospitalized in New York City in 1987. She was the first person hospitalized under a Mayor Ed Koch administration program which expanded the city's ability to forcibly commit homeless New Yorkers to psychiatric hospitals. Between 1987 and 1988, Brown worked with the New York Civil Liberties Union to challenge her hospitalization in a case which attracted significant media attention. During the ensuing trial, her lawyers argued that her behaviors were not in line with social expectations but did not rise to the level of posing a danger to herself or others. Brown took the stand, and her clarity while testifying became part of the public conversation. The trial ended in her favor, and while the city won on appeal she was ultimately released after a subsequent case determined that the city could not forcibly medicate her. Following her release, she made several television appearances and spoke about homelessness at Harvard Law School, but came to avoid the press. Her case sparked national conversations about how best to care for the people with mental illnesses.

Background
The 1975 Supreme Court decision O'Connor v. Donaldson limited involuntary psychiatric hospitalization to those who posed a danger to themselves or others. Many states passed legislation following the ruling, including New York, which passed its Mental Hygiene Law in 1978, allowing involuntary hospitalization of people with mental illness if they were considered a danger to themselves or others. The case was one part of a larger trend of deinstitutionalization in the United States, which began in the late 1950s and resulted in the release of hundreds of thousands of people from psychiatric hospitals. These changes, along with inadequate social programs, housing policies, and broader economic conditions contributed to an increase in homelessness in parts of the United States.

In New York City, Mayor Ed Koch established Project HELP (Homeless Emergency Liaison Project) in 1982 to provide food, clothing, medical, and psychiatric services to homeless people in Manhattan. Sometimes staff would bring people to psychiatric hospitals but most were not admitted because they did not fit the legal requirements. Koch was frustrated that so many of the people his staff determined needed hospitalization were not being treated due to the typical interpretation of New York law, so he began exploring ways to interpret the legal language differently. He was advised that case law could support a reinterpretation of the Mental Hygiene Law's requirement that someone be a ""danger to themselves or others"" to include a consideration of whether people's behaviors, including self-neglect, might pose a danger to themselves or others in the future, even if there was no immediate danger. While considering these changes, Koch met with people who would be affected by this change, including Brown, ",medicine
Handball (schoolyard game),"Handball is a children's ball game widely documented in Australian schools, similar to downball. The rules of the game vary considerably across different sites and conditions, but it is generally played on a flat game court with lined square zones (occasionally with a wall for rebounds), and involves at least two players, who each occupies a square and take turns hitting a ball (often a tennis ball, squash ball or, occasionally, a bouncy ball) with their bare hands into other player's square(s). The game is very easy to set up and can be conveniently adapted to any environments where square/rectangular-lined flat grounds can be found, such as other gyms/arenas, parking spaces and even concrete slabbed driveways and footpaths.
In Australia and New Zealand, the sport is sometimes confused with European handball, an Olympic sport that is not widely played in either country.

History
On July 4, 1954, the American folklorist Dorothy Howard arrived in Australia. In the next nine months, she visited nineteen primary schools across the country to painstakingly document the folk games the children played. Among the children's games Howard recorded was four square, also known as handball, which was played in seven of the schools. The rules of the game varied between them, and many schools played with considerable deviations.

Rules
Basic rules
A game must have at least two players.
The person in the leading square 'serves' the ball, bouncing it once within their square before it can enter an opponent's square.
Once the serve is complete, the receiver must hit the ball to another player.
The ball must be hit so that it bounces in the player's own square on the first bounce, and into another player's square on the second bounce.
If an outside object interferes with the play, the point will be replayed, known as a 'replay'
When a player is 'out', they must proceed to the lowest square, or to the end of the line of players waiting to enter the court. Players on the court who were in a lower position each move up a square. On 4 square courts there is one relegation square, with 6 or more squares there will usually be two. With two elimination squares it becomes possible for a player who just moved up from the first square to be eliminated and sent back to the line by the player they just pushed down to the first square.
Full/Straight/Lob: when the ball lands in another player's square on the first bounce, the player has 'lobbed' or has hit a 'foul'. In some variants, if a player does not catch the ball and continues to play, they have 'played the lob/foul' also known as a 'full play' and are therefore out.
Out: when the ball lands outside of the court, the last person who touched the ball or the last court the ball touched is out.
Double Bounce/Dubs/Doubles: when the ball bounces twice in a person's square, the person who is in that square is out. Usually known as 'double', 'double bounce'.
If the first bounce lands on a line and is not a 'full' or a 'double', ",sports
Pauli Gerrei trilingual inscription,"The Pauli Gerrei trilingual inscription is a trilingual Greek-Latin-Phoenician inscription on the base of a bronze column found in San Nicolò Gerrei in Sardinia in 1861. The stele was discovered by a notary named Michele Cappai, on the right side of the Strada statale 387 del Gerrei that descends towards Ballao.
Spano donated the inscription to the Museum of Turin; Turin had been the first capital of the unified Kingdom of Italy from 1861 to 1865. Spano subsequently obtained the nomination as Senator of the Kingdom. It is currently in the Turin Archaeology Museum. On 10 October 2009 the then mayor Silvestro Furcas requested the inscription be returned to Pauli Gerrei.
It is also known as KAI 66 and CIS I 143.

Inscriptions
The inscriptions are a votive gift, a Phoenician votive inscription, to the Sardinian healing deity, equivalent to the Phoenician Eshmun and the Greco-Roman Asclepius in gratitude for a grace received.
The three texts do not correspond perfectly to each other. It is thought that the dedications were addressed to different social groups. The Latin text states that Cleon claims is a ""slave (S.) of the contracting partners  of the salt pans""; the fact that he does not indicate the name of his father and of the tribe he belongs to is an indication of his social status as a servant. The Punic text does not label Cleon as a slave but instead as an employee of the saltworks concession. The Greek inscription described Cleon's role as ""superintendent of the salt pans"".

Latin: CLEON.SALARI.SOC.S.AESCOLAPIO.MERRE.DONVM.DEDIT.LUBENS.MERITO.MERENTE.
Translation: Cleon, a salari(ed) s(lave) of (the) comp(any), dedicated (this altar) as a gift to Asclepius-Merre, to whom thanks is deserving.

History of Belém,"The History of Belém refers to the history of this Brazilian municipality in the Northern Region of the country, the capital of the state of Pará, which had its origins in the 17th century in the indigenous region of Mairi, located 160 km from the equator.

Overview
Until the beginning of the sixteenth century, Portugal showed no interest in the lands located at the mouth of the Amazon River; a fact possibly linked to the policies adopted by the royal courts of the first expansionist phase, more concerned with expanding their domains along the African coast and the East. However, the succession crisis that led to the union of the courts of Portugal and Spain, coupled with the threat of pirates and smugglers in the region near the equator, implied a change of attitude beyond the Treaty of Tordesillas. This accelerated a response in military terms materialized in expeditions for the expulsion of the invaders and the establishment of settlements along the borders. One of these was the expedition commanded by Francisco Caldeira Castelo Branco (1566-1619) toward the mouth of the Amazon River.
The construction of a city in the middle of the Amazon rainforest was difficult regarding the change in the natural environment; colonizers faced flooded lands, intersected by streams, intense vegetation, and periods of heavy rain.
Belém had economic and political strengths, such as in 1621, when the colonial settlement was elevated to the category of the municipality with the denomination of ""Santa Maria de Belém do Pará"" or ""Nossa Senhora de Belém do Grão Pará"". In 1625, the fiscal warehouse ""Casa de Haver o Peso"" was created and in 1654, due to the importance of the warehouse the ""State of Maranhão"" was renamed to ""State of Maranhão and Grão-Pará""; In 1751, Belém reached its first commercial peak and became the first capital of the Brazilian Amazon.

History
Etymology
The toponym ""belém"" originates from the Hebrew ""בית לחם"" (""Beit Lehem""), literally meaning ""House of Bread"".
In 1621, the initial Portuguese colonial settlement ""Feliz Lusitânia"" (now Belém) was elevated to the category of the municipality with the name ""Santa Maria de Belém do Pará"" or ""Nossa Senhora de Belém do Grão Pará"" (an homage to Mary mother of Jesus) - being called by the abbreviation ""Belém do Pará"" by King Philip III of Spain (1578-1621). The name can also be considered an homage to the western day of Christmas (December 25); the day when Captain Francisco Caldeira Castelo Branco (1566 - 1619, former Captain-Mor of Rio Grande do Norte) left in 1615 from the city of São Luís to secure the dominion of the eastern Amazon and the riches of the Conquista do Pará.

European beginnings and colonization
The region where Belém do Pará is located was initially the busy indigenous region of Mairi, home of the Tupinambá and Pacajás (under the command of cacique Guaimiaba). In 1580, the Portuguese invaded the area through the military expedition Feliz Lusitânia commanded by Captain Castelo Branco (",history
Change and continuity,"Change and continuity is a classic dichotomy within the fields of history, historical sociology, and the social sciences more broadly. The question of change and continuity is considered a classic discussion in the study of historical developments. The dichotomy is used to discuss and evaluate the extent to which a historical development or event represents a decisive historical change or whether a situation remains largely unchanged. A good example of this discussion is the question of how much the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 represents an important change in European history. In a similar vein, historian Richard Kirkendall once questioned whether FDR's New Deal represented ""a radical innovation or a continuation of earlier themes in American life?"" and posed the question of whether ""historical interpretations of the New Deal [should] stress change or emphasize continuity?"" The issue here is if the New Deal marks something radically new (change) in US history or if the New Deal can be understood as a continuation (continuity) of tendencies in American history that were in place well before the 1930.
The dichotomy is important in relation to constructing, discussing, and evaluating historical periodizations. In terms of creating and discussing periodization (e.g. the Enlightenment or the Victorian Era,) the dichotomy can be used to assess when a period can be said to start and end, thus making the dichotomy important in relation to understanding historical chronology. Economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron has taken issue with the dichotomy, arguing that continuity ""appears to mean no more than absence of change, i.e. stability."" German historian Reinhart Koselleck, however, has been said to challenge this dichotomy.

Agronomy,"Agronomy, generally known as agriculture, is the science and technology of producing and using plants by agriculture for food, fuel, fiber, chemicals, recreation, or land conservation. Agronomy has come to include research of plant genetics, plant physiology, meteorology, and soil science. It is the application of a combination of sciences such as biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, earth science, and genetics. Professionals of agronomy are termed agronomists.

History
Early humans practiced hunter-gathering, but by around 10,000 BCE, they began to domesticate plants like wheat, barley and rice. This laid the foundation for agriculture.
Ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians, Egyptians and Romans made significant advances in farming. They introduced irrigation systems, crop rotation, and early forms of fertilization.
During this period, agricultural knowledge remained relatively static in Europe, though Islamic scholars made advances in agronomy. Ibn al-'Awwam, a 12th-century Andalusian agronomist, wrote the Kitāb al-Filāḥa, a comprehensive guide on farming practices, crop management and soil conservation.
The Renaissance saw a renewed interest in scientific exploration, including agriculture. Leonardo da Vinci and other scholars contributed to early agronomic theory, studying plant growth, crop rotation, and animal husbandry.
Agronomy emerged as a distinct scientific discipline in the 1800s, driven by advancements in chemistry and biology. The development of scientific methods led to the study of plant physiology, soil chemistry, and the role of fertilizers in crop production. Justus von Liebig, a German chemist, made groundbreaking discoveries about plant nutrition, establishing that plants require specific minerals, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, for growth.
In the early 20th century, industrialization began transforming agriculture. Mechanization, the development of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and improved crop varieties, led to higher agricultural productivity. The Green Revolution (1940s-1960s), led by scientists like Norman Borlaug, introduced high-yield crop varieties and modern farming techniques, helping to avert hunger in many parts of the world.
By the late same century, concerns over the environmental impact of industrial agriculture, such as soil degradation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss, led to a push toward sustainable agriculture. Today agronomy continues to adapt to challenges of climate change, global food security and the need to balance productivity with environmental stewardship.

Plant breeding
This topic of agronomy involves selective breeding of plants to produce the best crops for various conditions. Plant breeding has increased crop yields and has improved the nutritional value of numerous crops, including corn, soybeans, and wheat. It has also resulted in the development of new types of plants. For example, a hybrid grain named triticale was produced by crossbreeding rye and wh",science
Food regimes,"Food regime theory is a broadly Marxist approach to theorising food systems. It was developed in the late 1980s by Harriet Friedmann and Philip McMichael. Food regime analysis is concerned with explaining, and therefore politicising, the strategic role of agriculture in the construction and development of the world capitalist economy. As a framework, it takes a historical view in order to identify stable periods of capital accumulation associated with particular configurations of geopolitical power and forms of agricultural production and consumption.  Its theoretical roots are in French Regulation Theory and World Systems Theory.
With its Marxist influences, food regime theorists are also interested in how moments of crisis within a particular configuration are expressive of the dialectical tension that animates movement between such configurations (i.e. periods of transition).  According to leading food regime proponent Philip McMichael, then, food regimes are always characterised by contradictory forces.  Further, consolidation of a regime does not so much resolve as it does contain, or else strategically accommodate, these tensions; meanwhile, their intensification, often via the mobilisations of social movements, tends to signal a period of transition.

Response and criticism
Some academics have claimed that the food regime theory is very limited in its ability to describe all food security issues. A key problem with the theory is that it does not look at localized issues for individual countries, but rather tries to group all the world into a broad grouping.

Key texts
The seminal texts are as follows:

Harriet Friedmann's (1987) ""International regimes of food and agriculture since 1870""
Friedmann and McMichael's (1989) ""Agriculture and the state system: the rise and fall of national agricultures, 1870 to the present""
Further, Philip McMichael's more recent article (2009), ""A food regime genealogy"", provides a comprehensive overview of the development of the concept, key themes and debates, and a guide to further reading.

Class discrimination,"Class discrimination, also known as classism, is prejudice or discrimination on the basis of social class. It includes individual attitudes, behaviors, systems of policies and practices that are set up to benefit the upper class at the expense of the lower class.
Social class refers to the grouping of individuals in a hierarchy based on wealth, income, education, occupation, and social network.
Studies show an intersection between class discrimination and racism and sexism. Legislation shows efforts to reduce such intersections and classism at an individual level.

History
Class structures existed in a simplified form in pre-agricultural societies, but it has evolved into a more complex and established structure following the establishment of permanent agriculture-based civilizations with a food surplus. 
Classism started to be practiced around the 18th century. Segregation into classes was accomplished through observable traits (such as race or profession) that were accorded varying statuses and privileges. Feudal classification systems might include merchant, serf, peasant, warrior, priestly, and noble classes. Rankings were far from invariant with the merchant class in Europe outranking the peasantry, while merchants were explicitly inferior to peasants during the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan. Other prominent forms of classism include India's caste system, where caste and class often intersected and caused discrimination against certain peoples. 
Modern classism, with less rigid class structures, is harder to identify. In a professional association posting, psychologist Thomas Fuller-Rowell states, ""Experiences of [class] discrimination are often subtle rather than blatant, and the exact reason for unfair treatment is often not clear to the victim.""

Intersections with other systems of oppression
Both gender and racial inequality intersect with class discrimination, influencing economic opportunities and social mobility for marginalized groups.
Class discrimination and gender inequality intersect by shaping economic disparities that disproportionately affect women, particularly those in lower-income groups. Research indicates that women are more likely to be employed in low-wage and part-time jobs, limiting their financial security and career advancement opportunities. Occupational segregation, where women are overrepresented in sectors such as caregiving and retail, contributes to persistent wage gaps.  For example, as of 2022, Black women make up 6% of employed workers but are 32% of home aids, where they earn on average $23,803 per year. Women constitute nearly two-thirds of workers in the 20 occupations with the lowest median wages for full-time, year-round employees.Additionally, economic barriers can exacerbate gender inequality in access to education and leadership positions, reinforcing systemic disadvantages.
Similarly, the intersection of class and racial discrimination manifests in economic disparities that disproportionately impact ",politics
Pediatric endocrinology,"Pediatric endocrinology (British: Paediatric)  is a medical subspecialty dealing with disorders of the endocrine glands, such as variations of physical growth and sexual development in childhood, diabetes and many more.
By age, pediatric endocrinologists, depending upon the age range of the patients they treat, care for patients from infancy to late adolescence and young adulthood.
The most common disease of the specialty is type 1 diabetes, which usually accounts for at least 50% of a typical clinical practice. The next most common problem is growth disorders, especially those amenable to growth hormone treatment. Pediatric endocrinologists are usually the primary physicians involved in the medical care of infants and children with intersex disorders. The specialty also deals with hypoglycemia and other forms of hyperglycemia in childhood, variations of puberty, as well other adrenal, thyroid, and pituitary problems. Many pediatric endocrinologists have interests and expertise in bone metabolism, lipid metabolism, adolescent gynecology, or inborn errors of metabolism.
Most pediatric endocrinologists in North America and many from around the world can trace their professional genealogy to Lawson Wilkins, who pioneered the specialty in the pediatrics department of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Harriet Lane Home in Baltimore in between the late 1940s and the mid-1960s.

Professional training
In the United States and Canada, pediatric endocrinology is a subspecialty of the American Board of Pediatrics or the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics, with board certification following fellowship training. It is a relatively small and primarily cognitive specialty, with few procedures and an emphasis on diagnostic evaluation.
Training for pediatric endocrinology consists of a 3-year fellowship following completion of a 3-year pediatrics residency. The fellowship, and the specialty, are heavily research-oriented and academically based, although less exclusively now than in past decades.

Professional organizations
The principal North American professional association was originally named the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, now renamed the Pediatric Endocrine Society. Other longstanding pediatric endocrine associations include the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, the Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group and the Japanese Society for Pediatric Endocrinology. Professional associations of the specialty continue to proliferate.

Controversial treatment guidelines
In 2021, the Pediatric Endocrine Society offered updated recommendations for use of growth-promoting hormone therapy and related medications in children. The Guidelines for Growth Hormone and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Treatment in Children and Adolescents were updated from 2003 and reflect the continuing controversy over how to diagnose, categorize and treat growth failure in children.

List of regions by past GDP (PPP),"These are lists of regions and countries by their estimated real gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), the value of all final goods and services produced within a country/region in a given year. GDP dollar (international dollar) estimates here are derived from PPP estimates.

Methodology
In the absence of sufficient data for nearly all economies until well into the 19th century, past GDP cannot be calculated, but at best only roughly estimated. In a first step, economic historians try to reconstruct the GDP per capita for a given political or geographical entity from the meagre evidence. This value is then multiplied by estimated population size, another determinant for which as a rule only little ancient data is available.
A key notion in the whole process is that of subsistence, the income level which is necessary for sustaining one's life. Since pre-modern societies, by modern standards, were characterized by a very low degree of urbanization and a large majority of people working in the agricultural sector, economic historians prefer to express income in cereal units. To achieve comparability over space and time, these numbers are then converted into monetary units such as International Dollars, a third step which leaves a relatively wide margin of interpretation.
The formula thus is: GDP (PPP) = GDP per capita (PPP) x population size
It should be stressed that, historically speaking, population size is the far more important multiplier in the equation. This is because, in contrast to industrial economies, the average income ceiling of premodern agrarian societies was quite low everywhere, possibly not higher than twice the subsistence level. Therefore, the total GDP as given below primarily reflects the respective historical population size, and is much less indicative of contemporary living standards than, for example, estimations of past GDP per capita are.
According to the 20th-century macroeconomist Paul Bairoch, a pioneer in historical economic analysis, 

it is obvious that by itself the volume of total GNP has no important significance, and that the volume of GNP is not by itself the expression of the economic strength of a nation.
Rather, Bairoch advocates a formula combining GNP per capita and total GNP to give a better measure of the economic performance of national economies.

1750–1990 (Bairoch)
In his 1995 book Economics and World History, economic historian Paul Bairoch gave the following estimates in terms of 1960 US dollars, for GNP from 1750 to 1990, comparing what are today the Third World (Asia, Africa, Latin America) and the First World (Western Europe, Northern America, Japan)

Grassroots democracy,"Grassroots democracy is a tendency towards designing political processes that shift as much decision-making authority as practical to the organization's lowest geographic or social level of organization. 
Grassroots organizations can have a variety of structures; depending on the type of organization and what the members want. These can be non-structured and non-hierarchical organizations that are run by all members, or by whichever member wishes to do something. 
To cite a specific hypothetical example, a national grassroots organization would place as much decision-making power as possible in the hands of local chapters or common members instead of the head office.  The principle is that for democratic power to be best exercised it must be vested in a local community and common members and instead of isolated, atomized individuals, at the top of the organization. Grassroots organizations can inhabit participatory systems.  Grassroots systems differ from representative systems that allow local communities or national memberships to elect representatives who then go on to make decisions.
The difference among the three systems comes down to where they rest on two different axes:  the rootedness in a community (grassroots versus national or international);  and the ability of all individuals to participate in the shared decision-making process (participatory versus representative).

As an economic system
Grassroots democracy is a key component of  libertarian socialist political philosophies, which, for various reasons, advocate putting firms under the control of local communities or councils. For example, eco-socialists argue that firms should be controlled by the group of people whose ecosystem is directly affected by that firm's activity. Meanwhile, Anarchists view contemporary forms of employment as examples of unjust and unnecessary forms of hierarchy and centralization. Finally, Libertarian Marxists view history as a struggle between various social groups where the inclusive nature of a grassroots economy will enable new socioeconomic groups to emerge such that these struggles will abate, thereby,  improving the human condition.

Frisbee sports,"Flying disc sports are sports or games played with discs, often called by the trademarked name Frisbees. Ultimate and disc golf are sports with substantial international followings.

History
The flying disc was developed in 1948 by Walter Morrison. On January 23, 1957, Wham-O bought the rights to the invention and released it later under the trademarked name Frisbee.
Although playing catch with discs as a pastime and proto-golf games are documented from the early 1900s, and doubtlessly occurred from time to time before, disc sports began to flower in the late 1960s. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they looked for alternative recreational activities, including throwing a frisbee. What started with a few players in the sixties, like Victor Malafronte, Z Weyand and Ken Westerfield experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a disc, later would become known as playing disc freestyle. Organized disc sports began in the 1970s with promotional efforts from Wham-O and Irwin Toy (Canada). These took the form of national tournaments and Frisbee show tours at universities, fairs and sporting events. Disc sports such as freestyle, double disc court, guts, ultimate and disc golf became this sport's first events. Two sports, the team sport of ultimate and disc golf, are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi-professionally. The World Flying Disc Federation, Professional Disc Golf Association and the Freestyle Players Association are the official sanctioning organizations for disc sports worldwide.
Guts was invented by the Healy Brothers in the 1950s and developed at the International Frisbee Tournament (IFT) in Marquette, Michigan. Ultimate, the most widely played disc sport, began in the late 1960s with Joel Silver and Jared Kass. In the 1970s it developed as an organized sport with the creation of the Ultimate Players Association with Dan Roddick, Tom Kennedy and Irv Kalb. Double disc court was invented and introduced in the early 1970s by Jim Palmeri. In 1974, freestyle competition was created and introduced by Ken Westerfield and Discraft's Jim Kenner. Judging standards were developed by the Freestyle Players Association. In 1976, the game of disc golf was standardized with targets called ""pole holes"" invented and developed by Wham-O's Ed Headrick and the Professional Disc Golf Association.
Beginning in 1974, the International Frisbee Association (IFA), under the direction of Dan Roddick, became the regulatory organization for all of these sports.

Ultimate
Ultimate (also called Ultimate Frisbee) is a competitive non-contact team sport. The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to a team member in the opposing team's end zone. Players may not move about the field while holding the disc. Catching is done with one hand or both hands on the rim or with hands simultaneously on the top and bottom, sometimes referred to as a clap-catch. When one-hand catching on the rim, care must always b",sports

Social work management,"Social work management is the management of organisations or enterprises in the social economy and non-profit sector, e.g., public service providers, charities, youth welfare offices, associations, etc. 
Social work management has been traditionally pursued by social workers, social pedagogues, pedagogues, psychologists without additional management skills and knowledge or legal practitioners and business economists – often without reference to the social economy. Furthermore, Social work management is a field of education & practice established since 1980s in Europe & North America that focuses on person-centred leadership, motivation & strategic issues. It manages organizations in social economy & non-profit sector.
Most scholars and practitioners agree that social work managers need to have a high degree of leadership skills to make considered managerial decisions, to empower social workers, to develop staff within and collaborate with partners outside the social and human service organisation. Social work management as a field of social work education and practice was established in many universities in Europe and North America  since the 1980s. Established qualifications in higher education first included diplomas in social economy. It originally focused on person-centred leadership, motivation and strategic issues. It combines management with social pedagogical, psychological, and sociological knowledge and skills.

Definition
In today's understanding, social management includes all management functions that are necessary for the management of social and/or non-profit organizations. This includes finance and accounting of social organizations, development of mission statements and concepts, city and social marketing, public relations, organizational development, human resource management, project management, quality management and other sub-disciplines of management and business administration.
In contrast to management in other industries, branches and areas of the economy (e.g. sports management or media and education management), social work management takes into account characteristics especially of organizations in the social sector: the provision of person-centered social services, the peculiarities of non-profit organizations and, in particular, labour and welfare services, the close integration into the social law as well as the character of the services as merit goods. With the increasing spread of private providers, social work management is also referred to as the management of enterprises in the social economy. Against this background, social work management can also be understood as a so-called specialised form of business administration for social enterprises or companies.
Some authors also understand social work management as the management of people with special consideration of human relationships in the sense of human resources management. However, this understanding does not apply to all social services organizations. A s",economics
Age of Discovery,"The Age of Discovery (c. 1418 – c. 1620), also known as the Age of Exploration, was part of the early modern period and largely overlapped with the Age of Sail. It was a period from approximately the late 15th century to the 17th century, during which seafarers from a number of European countries explored, colonized, and conquered regions across the globe. The Age of Discovery was a transformative period in world history when previously isolated parts of the world became connected to form the world-system and laid the groundwork for globalization. The extensive overseas exploration, particularly the opening of maritime routes to the Indies and the European colonization of the Americas by the Spanish and Portuguese, later joined by the English, French and Dutch, spurred in the international global trade. The interconnected global economy of the 21st century has its origins in the expansion of trade networks during this historic era.
The exploration also created colonial empires and marked an increased adoption of colonialism as a government policy in several European states. As such, it is sometimes synonymous with the first wave of European colonization. The colonization reshaped power dynamics causing geopolitical shifts in Europe and creating new centers of power beyond Europe. Having set human history on the global common course, the legacy of the Age still shapes the world today.
European oceanic exploration started with the maritime expeditions of Portugal to the Canary Islands in 1336, and later with the Portuguese discoveries of the Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and Azores, the coast of West Africa in 1434, and the establishment of the sea route to India in 1498 by Vasco da Gama, which initiated the Portuguese maritime and trade presence in Kerala and the Indian Ocean.
During the Age of Discovery, Spain sponsored and financed the transatlantic voyages of the Italian navigator Christopher Columbus, which from 1492 to 1504 marked the start of colonization in the Americas, and the expedition of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan to open a route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, which later achieved the first circumnavigation of the globe between 1519 and 1522. These Spanish expeditions significantly impacted the European perceptions of the world. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Australia that continued into the late 19th century, followed by the exploration of the polar regions in the 20th century.
European exploration initiated the Columbian exchange between the Old World (Europe, Asia, and Africa) and the New World (the Americas). This exchange involved the transfer of plants, animals, human populations (including slaves), communicable diseases, and culture across the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The Age of Discovery and European exploration involved mapping of the world, shaping a new worldview a",history
Nucleus estate and smallholder,"Nucleus estate and smallholder (NES) is a farming system for commodity crops, often oil palm, practised in different world regions. It is most famous today for its application in the palm oil sector in Indonesia. The nucleus is the part of such a plantation that is under concession and management of the company, while another part of the plantation is operated by smallholders typically on their own land but planted by the company. NES farming is a particular form of contract farming.

Origins
The system was first implemented by Commonwealth Development Corporation in the 1950s in various African countries.

System
Smallholders work on their own farms usually organized in farmers' cooperatives and are contractually bound to the company. In Indonesia the price for fresh fruit bunches (FFB) in this scheme is set by the government.
The motivation for this kind of organizational and contractual arrangement is mainly that the initial investments to establish a plantation is considerable. Clearing land, building roads, and planting trees on sizeable areas requires not only elevated economic power but also technical skills. This part, therefore, is in the company's responsibility while the costs are later deducted from the payments made to the farmers.
Smallholders can benefit from the arrangement through technological transfers. Not only in the establishment of the plantation does the company play an important role. Also during operations, the company usually provides inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides to the smallholders. Often smallholders have additional independent oil palm farms where they can apply their newly acquired skills.

Country cases
Indonesia
History
The scheme has a long history in Indonesia, where it is commonly known as Inti-Plasma farming, Inti being the nucleus and plasma the smallholdings. It has been implemented in different ways since 1978. The first model was called PIR Lokal (Perkebunan Inti Rakyat Lokal) and was designed for local populations.
In later forms, NES was designed to settle transmigrants on the so called outer islands of Indonesia (i.e. outside of Java and Madura). This form of inti-plasma is called PIR Trans which stands for Perkebunan Inti Rakyat Transmigrasi, i.e. Nucleus Estate Smallholders Project for Transmigrants. Construction of health treatment facilities and public facilities such as roads, schools, houses of worship, clinics, and other projects were at times part of the PIR scheme.
Another, more recent form of the system, started in the 1990s and is called KKPA. It stands for Kredit Koperasi Primer Anggota, i.e. Credit for Cooperative Primary Members and is not attached to the transmigration program.
Recently, in the wake of decentralization and neo-liberal reforms, the kemitraan (partnership) scheme is shifting away from NES mechanics. Smallholders typically do no longer work on their land but receive dividends from their plantation part. This has shown to be very disadvantageous for the 'smallhold",economics
List of commodities exchanges,"A commodities exchange is an exchange, or market, where various commodities are traded. Most commodity markets around the world trade in agricultural products and other raw materials (like wheat, barley, sugar, maize, cotton, cocoa, coffee, milk products, pork bellies, oil, and metals). Trading includes various types of derivatives contracts based on these commodities, such as forwards, futures and options, as well as spot trades (for immediate delivery).
A futures contract provides that an agreed quantity and quality of the commodity will be delivered at some agreed future date. A farmer raising corn can sell a futures contract on his corn, which will not be harvested for several months, and gets a guarantee of the price he will be paid when he delivers; a breakfast cereal producer buys the contract and gets a guarantee that the price will not go up when it is delivered. This protects the farmer from price drops and the buyer from price rises. Speculators and investors also buy and sell these contracts to try to make a profit; they provide liquidity to the system.
Some of these exchanges also trade financial derivatives, such as interest rate and foreign exchange futures, as well as other instruments such as ocean freight contracts and environmental instruments. In some cases these are mentioned in the lists below.

Trivial Pursuit,"Trivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer trivia and popular culture questions. Players move their pieces around a board, the squares they land on determining the subject of a question they are asked from a card (from six categories including ""history"" and ""science and nature""). Each correct answer allows the player's turn to continue; a correct answer on one of the six ""category headquarters"" spaces earns a plastic wedge which is slotted into the answerer's playing piece. The object of the game is to collect all six wedges from each ""category headquarters"" space, and then return to the center ""hub"" space to answer a question in a category selected by the other players.
Since the game's first release in 1981, numerous themed editions have been released. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies).

History
The game was created on December 15, 1979, in Niagara on the Lake, Ontario, by Canadians  Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press. After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing, they decided to create their own game. With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1981. During the development of the game, some of the early work and question writing was completed by Chris and John Haney in Weymouth Library, Dorset where they were staying with family.
The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (later part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008, Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.
By 1986, the board game had sold 20 million units, grossing $600 million in sales. As of 2014, more than 100 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the ""Games Hall of Fame"" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003.

Gameplay
The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, the Geography category is blue, Entertainment is pink, History is yellow, Art & Literature is originally brown, later purple, Science & Nature is green, and Sports & Leisure is orange. The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die.
Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections like wedges of pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called a cheese (like ",sports
Applied ecology,"Applied ecology is a sub-field within ecology that considers the application of the science of ecology to real-world (usually management) questions. It is also described as a scientific field that focuses on the application of concepts, theories, models, or methods of fundamental ecology to environmental problems.

Concept
Applied ecology is an integrated treatment of the ecological, social, and biotechnological aspects of natural resource conservation and management. Applied ecology typically focuses on geomorphology, soils, and plant communities as the underpinnings for vegetation and wildlife (both game and non-game) management.
Applied ecology includes all disciplines that are related to human activities so that it does not only cover agriculture, forestry and fisheries but also global change. It has two study categories. The first involves the outputs or those fields that address the use and management of the environment, particularly for its ecosystem services and exploitable resources. The second are the inputs or those that are concerned with the management strategies or human influences on the ecosystem or biodiversity.
The discipline is often linked to ecological management on the grounds that the effective management of natural ecosystems depends on ecological knowledge. It often uses an ecological approach to solve problems of specific parts of the environment, which can involve the comparison of plausible options (e.g. best management options).
The role of applied science in agricultural production has been brought into greater focus as fluctuations in global food production feed through into prices and availability to consumers.

Approaches
Applied ecologists often use one or more of the following approaches, namely, observation, experimentation, and modeling. For example, a wildlife preservation project could involve: observational studies of the wildlife ecology;  experiments to understand causal relationships; and the application of modeling to determine the information beyond the scope of experimentation.
The ecological approach used in applied ecology could include inputs from management strategies such as conservation biology, restoration ecology, global change, ecotoxicology, biomonitoring, biodiversity, environmental policies, and economics, among others. Restoration ecology is a particularly prominent strategy in the discipline since it applies the principles of restoring and repairing damaged ecological systems to their original state.
Like those used in ecological theory, many areas of the discipline employ approaches that are based on simple statistical and analytic models (e.g. spatial models) as well as those with mathematical properties (e.g. matrix models). There is also the digital computer simulation modeling, which is designed to solve statistical ecology problems and to achieve bioeconomic goals such as the forecasting and the evaluation of consequences for specific activities.
Applied ecology also requires human",science
Far-left politics,"Far-left politics, also known as extreme left politics or left-wing extremism, are politics further to the left on the left–right political spectrum than the standard political left. The term does not have a single, coherent definition; some scholars consider it to be the left of communist parties, while others broaden it to include the left of social democracy. In certain instances—especially in the news media—far left has been associated with some forms of authoritarianism, anarchism, communism, and Marxism, or are characterized as groups that advocate for revolutionary socialism and related communist ideologies, or anti-capitalism and anti-globalization. Far-left terrorism consists of extremist, militant, or insurgent groups that attempt to realize their ideals through political violence rather than using democratic processes.

Ideologies
The far-left is heterogeneous, and wide variety exists between different far-left groups. The definition of the far-left varies in the literature and there is not a general agreement on what it entails or consensus on the core characteristics that constitute the far left, other than being to the left of mainstream left-wing politics.
Far-left groups are alike in their support for radical politics and systemic reorganization of society, as opposed to the reformist politics of the centre-left. The far-left seeks to replace capitalism with communism so it can create a society without exploitation, oppression, and class inequality. The method to bring about communism became the primary distinction among new far-left ideologies as they developed, and ideas of how a communist society should function changed over time. Over time, far-left groups became more willing to work within liberal capitalist nations as revolutions failed to develop.
As with all political alignments, the exact boundaries of centre-left versus far-left politics are not clearly defined and can vary depending on context. Far-left ideologies often include types of socialism, communism, and anarchism. Academic study of far-left politics often uses the term radical left as an all-encompassing term, though some far-left groups object to this usage as derogatory. Extreme left and anti-capitalist are also commonly used as synonyms for the far-left. Far-left political parties use a variety of descriptors for themselves, including workers', labour, socialist, communist, militant, and revolutionary parties.
The far-left is regarded as being to the left of social democracy. While it historically opposed social democracy over its reformist nature, the post-Soviet far-left accuses social democracy of being too comfortable with neoliberalism.
Far-left politics is traditionally centred on the idea of a unified working class. Karl Marx defined the working class as including all waged employees of all industries. The development of middle management and decline of the petite bourgeoisie complicated the definition over time. Students and intellectuals have often ",politics
Corn-rent,"Corn rent is a type of variable money rent that follows fluctuations in the price of corn. The word corn in British English denoted all cereal grains, including wheat, oats and barley.
The underlying concept of corn-rent is that a tenant farmer pays a portion of the produce of a farm to the landlord as rent. However, the price of produce varies and so the money value of this allotted portion varies based on the price.

Medieval Hungary
Different types of rents existed in the feudal system of Medieval Hungary including rent in kind which could mean gifts like chickens, loaves of bread, butter, etc. or the less common (but more burdensome) corn tax paid from the yields produced on tenant farm lands. The demand for 1/9th of the corn crop is found in the law of 1351 there is evidence for its collection from 1438 at Pécsvárad Abbey, in 1451 at the bishopric of Varad (modern Romania), Köszvényes, Tolna County in 1465, Károly in Szatmár County in 1481, and Lippó in Baranya County in 1483.
Corn rent was often collected as a fixed quantity rather than a proportion of yield in the villages attached to the estates of Zalavár, Komárom, Karakó, Sempte, Bátmonostor manor in Bodrog, Marótis manor, and numerous villages of the Töttös estates in Baranya. The exact amount varied even among the villages of each estate, for instance only two villages of Csente manor paid the corn rent, while in some areas other cereals like rye and oats were also subject to similar provisions.

Enclosures
The 1830 case King v. Joddrell concerned Yelling Parish, the corn rent was imposed as compensation after the practice of paying tithes ended when the parish was enclosed by an act of Parliament.

Ricardo and Malthus
David Ricardo wrote:

""But there are improvements which may lower the relative value of the produce without lowering the corn rent, though they will lower the money rent of the land. Such improvements do not increase the productive powers of the land; but they enable us to obtain its produce with less labour...Less capital, which is the same thing as less labour , will be emploued on the land; but to obtain the same produce, less land cannot be cultivated. Whether improvements of this kind, however, effect corn rent, must depend on the question, whether the difference between the produce obtained by the employment of different portions of capital be increased, stationary or diminished. If four portions of capital, 50, 60, 70 and 80, be employed on the land, giving each the same results, and any provement in the formation of such capital should enable me to withdraw five from each, so that they should be 45, 55, 65, and 75, no alteration would take place in the corn rent.""

In Principles Ricardo defines rent as the ""proportion of the whole produce [of the produce obtained with a given capital on a given farm] without any reference to its exchangeable value"". Ricardo reasons that where ""the same cause, the difficulty of production, raises the exchangeable value of raw pro",economics
Economics of digitization,"The economics of digitization is the field of economics that studies how digitization, digitalisation and digital transformation affects markets and how digital data can be used to study economics. Digitization is the process by which technology lowers the costs of storing, sharing, and analyzing data. This has changed how consumers behave, how industrial activity is organized, and how governments operate. The economics of digitization exists as a distinct field of economics for three reasons: it studies a world that is digital, exponential and combinatorial. First, new economic models are needed because digital goods have very low or even zero marginal costs unlike most traditional goods, thus many traditional assumptions no longer hold in a digitized world. Second, the rate of improvement of computers, networks and other engines of digitization, is exponential, as reflected by Moore's Law.  Third, digital goods can easily be combined and recombined, increasing their value not only via networks and platforms, but also novel combinations. Each of these effects is important individually, but together they have synergies and constitute a distinct economic landscape.
Research in the economics of digitization touches on several fields of economics including industrial organization, labor economics, and intellectual property. Consequently, many of the contributions to the economics of digitization have also found an intellectual home in these fields. An underlying theme in much of the work in the field is that existing government regulation of copyright, security, and antitrust is inappropriate in the modern world. For example, information goods, such as news articles and movies, now have zero marginal costs of production and sharing. This has made the redistribution without permission common and has increased competition between providers of information goods. Research in the economics of digitization studies how policy should adapt in response to these changes.

Information technology and access to networks
Technological standards
The Internet is a multi-layered network which is operated by a variety of participants. The Internet has come to mean a combination of standards, networks, and web applications (such as streaming and file-sharing), among other components, that have accumulated around networking technology. The emergence of the Internet coincided with the growth of a new type of organizational structure, the standards committee. Standards committees are responsible for designing critical standards for the Internet such as TCP/IP, HTML, and CSS. These committees are composed of representatives from firms, academia, and non-profit organizations. Their goal is to make decisions that advance technology while retaining interoperability between Internet components. Economists are interested in how these organizational structures make decisions and whether those decisions are optimal.

Operationalization,"In research design, especially in psychology, social sciences, life sciences and physics, operationalization or operationalisation is a process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon which is not directly measurable, though its existence is inferred from other phenomena. Operationalization thus defines a fuzzy concept so as to make it clearly distinguishable, measurable, and understandable by empirical observation. In a broader sense, it defines the extension of a concept—describing what is and is not an instance of that concept. For example, in medicine, the phenomenon of health might be operationalized by one or more indicators like body mass index or tobacco smoking. As another example, in visual processing the presence of a certain object in the environment could be inferred by measuring specific features of the light it reflects. In these examples, the phenomena are difficult to directly observe and measure because they are general/abstract (as in the example of health) or they are latent (as in the example of the object). Operationalization helps infer the existence, and some elements of the extension, of the phenomena of interest by means of some observable and measurable effects they have.
Sometimes multiple or competing alternative operationalizations for the same phenomenon are available. Repeating the analysis with one operationalization after the other can determine whether the results are affected by different operationalizations. This is called checking robustness. If the results are (substantially) unchanged, the results are said to be robust against certain alternative operationalizations of the checked variables.
The concept of operationalization was first presented by the British physicist N. R. Campbell in his 'Physics: The Elements' (Cambridge, 1920). This concept spread to humanities and social sciences. It remains in use in physics.

Theory
History
Operationalization is the scientific practice of operational definition, where even the most basic concepts are defined through the operations by which we measure them. The practice originated in the field of physics with the philosophy of science book The Logic of Modern Physics (1927), by Percy Williams Bridgman, whose methodological position is called ""operationalism"".
Bridgman wrote that in the theory of relativity a concept like ""duration"" can split into multiple different concepts. In refining a physical theory, it may be discovered that what was thought to be one concept is actually two or more distinct concepts. Bridgman proposed that if only operationally defined concepts are used, this will never happen.
Bridgman's theory was criticized because ""length"" is measured in various ways (e.g. it is impossible to use a measuring rod to measure the distance to the Moon), so ""length"" logically is not one concept but many, with some concepts requiring knowledge of geometry. Each concept is to be defined by the measuring operation used. So the criticism is that there are poten",science
International Association of Agricultural Economists,"The International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE) is an International professional organization for agricultural economists. IAAE publishes the peer-reviewed journal Agricultural Economics. The flagship conference of the International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE), the International Conference of Agricultural Economists (ICAE), is held every three years.
Although founded in England in 1929, the Association was only formally incorporated as a 501(c)(6) organization in the US as of 2012, as the ""International Association of Agricultural Economists, Inc"". The related ""Fund for the International Conference of Agricultural Economics"" was registered as a 501(c)(3) organization in the US in 1960, to offer support for travel and registration costs to the triennial conference.

History
The International Association of Agricultural Economists was formed in 1929 as a result of meetings organized by Leonard Knight Elmhirst and Carl Edwin Ladd. These were in part a response to the agricultural depression of the 1920s, following World War I.  The meetings were hosted by Elmhirst and his wife, heiress Dorothy Payne Whitney, at their home Dartington Hall in Devon, England.
Elmhirst's first conference at Dartington Hall in 1929 was followed by a second conference at his alma mater, Cornell University, USA, in 1930. International travel for many of the attendees was subsidized with the help of the Carnegie Endowment and the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation. At the 1930 conference, what was then known as the International Conference of Agricultural Economists (ICAE) adopted a constitution and agreed to publish proceedings for each meeting.  Leonard Elmhirst served as the president of the new organization from 1929 to 1958, and was subsequently designated as the ""founder president"" (1959-1974). George F. Warren (USA) and Max Sering (Germany) were the first co-vice presidents.
Subsequent conferences were held at Bad Eilsen, Germany (1934), St. Andrews, Scotland (1936) and Macdonald College, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada (1938). Eleven countries were represented in 1929 (Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and the United States),  thirty in 1930, and nineteen in 1934.  Organizers planned to hold a sixth conference in Hungary in 1941, but the next conference did not occur until 1947, after World War II.
In 1961, at the Eleventh International Conference of Agricultural Economists in Mexico, the name of the organization was officially changed to ""International Association of Agricultural Economists"" (IAAE), with the name ""International Conference of Agricultural Economists"" (ICAE) being retained for the actual conference.
The organization supported publication of the multi-volume World Atlas of Agriculture (1969-1976), collecting together text, maps, charts, and statistics about hundreds of countries.  ""The first complete coverage of world la",economics
Visual ethnography,"Visual ethnography is an approach to ethnography (the study of people and cultures) that uses visual methods such as photography, film and video. There are many methods available to conduct visual ethnography. According to Sarah Pink, visual ethnography is a research methodology that brings “theory and practice of visual approaches to learning and knowing about the world and communicating these to others”. As a methodology, visual ethnography can guide the design of research as well as the methods to choose for data collection. Visual ethnography suggests a negotiation of the participants’ view of reality and a constant questioning on the part of the researcher.

Historical development
Beginning in the early 1900s, researchers have recognized the importance of visual methods which has largely emerged from anthropology. That is when photography as well as video became ways of recording targeted populations during field work which are called “salvage ethnography” or “salvage anthropology.” Flaherty's Nanook of the North (1922), Margaret Mead's and Gregory Bateson's video and photos of the Balinese, and Evans-Prichard's photographs of the Nuer are examples of this “salvage ethnography (Pink, 2006, cited in van den Scott, 2018). Boas as explained by Pink was an early user of photography who did not trust it and was thought that surface images could be an issue in which might shift the historical understanding of culture. Through the 1900s to 1950s, mainstream anthropology rejected visual methods. Ethnographic photography was still in use- less for analysis and more for context. Despite the move away from applied anthropology through the 1970s and 1980s, ethnographic filmmaking is still common. Still marginal, Visual methods slowly became a tradition and exploded when reflexive research made a dramatic turn. Visual methods shaped interdisciplinary interest during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Visual methods became recognized across social sciences as digital technology became available, maintaining their roots in ethnography and anthropology. Sarah Pink claims for an “anthropology of the relationship between the visual and other elements of culture, society, practice and experience and the methodological practice of combining visual and other media in the production and representation of anthropological knowledge”.

Qualitative research
Visual ethnography as an aspect of the use of visual data has become increasingly important as a part of the qualitative research toolbox.  Qualitative research is an off-shoot of the anthropological practice of ethnography that focuses on the collection and analysis of diverse narrative or textual forms of expression.  In describing the importance of visual ethnography in qualitative research, Banks explained that as images are present in society their illustration should be included in the studies of society, and that study of images in the accumulation of data may reveal sociological understanding that may not be ",science
Sport,"Sport is a form of physical activity or game. Often competitive and organized, sports use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills. They also provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, some are done by a single person with others being done by hundreds. Most sports take place either in teams or competing as individuals. Some sports allow a ""tie"" or ""draw"", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament format, producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.
Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions admitting only sports meeting this definition. Some organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without any physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee who oversee the Olympic Games recognises both chess and bridge as sports. SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: chess, bridge, draughts, Go and xiangqi. However, they limit the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports. Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.
Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in others integral to the sport.
According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport.

Meaning and usage
Etymology
The word ""sport"" comes from the Old French desport meaning ""leisure"", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being ""anything humans find amusing or entertaining"".
Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise. Roget's defines the noun sport as an ""activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement"" with synonyms including diversion and recre",sports
Competition climbing,"Competition climbing is a form of regulated rock-climbing competition held indoors on purpose-built artificial climbing walls (earlier versions were held on external natural rock surfaces). The three competition climbing disciplines are lead climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing. The result of multiple disciplines can be used in a ""combined"" format to determine an all-round winner (or the ""combined"" winner). Competition climbing is sometimes called ""sport climbing"", which is the name given to pre-bolted lead climbing.
In competition lead climbing, competitors start at the bottom of a pre-bolted sport climbing route and lead-climb to touch or secure the highest climbing hold possible within a set time limit on a single attempt, making sure to clip the rope into pre-placed quickdraws while ascending. In competition bouldering, competitors climb short bouldering problems without a rope, with an emphasis on the number of problems completed, and the attempts necessary to do so. In competition speed climbing, competitors race-off in pairs on a standardised 'speed climbing wall' using a top rope on an auto belay, in the shortest time.
The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) regulates and organizes international competition climbing events, including the biennial IFSC Climbing World Championships, and the annual IFSC Climbing World Cup that is held as a series of events during the year. Competition climbing was first featured at the 2020 Summer Olympics in a once-off single combined format per gender, with the results based on a combination of lead climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing performances. Climbing at the 2024 Olympics had speed climbing as a standalone event, although lead and boulder are still a combined event.

History
Competition climbing dates from the arrival of sport climbing in the mid-1980s, which is a type of rock climbing where the climbing protection is pre-bolted into the climbing route, so the climber does not have to worry about their safety while ascending. Some were reticent about the ethics of competitive climbing, and in early 1985, several leading climbers signed the Manifeste des 19, rejecting the concept. However, later in 1985, the first internationally recognized competition climbing event was held at Sportroccia, which later became the annual Rock Master competition. These were annual lead climbing competitions held outdoors on natural rock surfaces and their first winners were Stefan Glowacz, Patrick Edlinger and Catherine Destivelle.
In 1988–89, the French Federation and Paul Brasset convinced the UIAA to regulate and administer competition climbing; it was agreed that events would be held on indoor artificial climbing walls. In 1989, the first UIAA Climbing World Cup was held over seven events around the world. In 1991, the first biennial UIAA World Climbing Championships was held in Frankfurt. In 1992, the first UIAA Climbing World Youth Championships was held in Basel. In 1998, bouldering and sp",sports
Bristol heart scandal,"The Bristol heart scandal occurred in England during the 1990s. At the Bristol Royal Infirmary, babies died at high rates after cardiac surgery. An inquiry found ""staff shortages, a lack of leadership, [a] ... unit ... 'simply not up to the task' ... 'an old boy's culture' among doctors, a lax approach to safety, secrecy about doctors' performance and a lack of monitoring by management"". The scandal resulted in cardiac surgeons leading efforts to publish more data on the performance of doctors and hospitals.

Concerns raised by Stephen Bolsin
Dr Stephen Bolsin joined the BRI team as an anaesthetist in 1988 and noticed high surgical mortality rates. As early as 1991, Bolsin raised concerns with high-ranking individuals at the trust and also contacted the NHS, the Department of Health, and the Royal Colleges. Bolsin was largely ignored until 1995, when Joshua Loveday died during a complex heart operation performed by Dr Janardan Dhasmana. After the death of Loveday, Bolsin emigrated to Australia. There he was praised for raising issues about the mortality rates at BRI and was promoted to professor. Subsequently, he was awarded the Royal College of Anaesthetists Frederic Hewitt Medal in 2013 in recognition of his contribution to patient safety.

Formal investigation
An investigation chaired by Professor Ian Kennedy QC was set up in 1998. It reported in 2001, concluding that paediatric cardiac surgery services at Bristol were ""simply not up to the task"" because of shortages of key surgeons and nurses, and a lack of leadership, accountability, and teamwork. In five years (1991–1995), 34 children under one year of age died in the unit, who are believed would have survived in other NHS units. Overall 170 children died in the Bristol unit between 1986 and 1995, who would have survived in other NHS hospitals, as estimated by Laurence Vick, the lawyer most closely involved in the Bristol scandal. The same expert estimates that 25–30 children suffered permanent brain damage after cardiac surgery by the Bristol surgeons over the same 10-year time span.

Formation of the Commission for Health Improvement and decline of mortality rates
The NHS Plan 2000, published a year earlier, included the establishment of the Commission for Health Improvement which was intended to tackle such problems.
The mortality rate within 30 days of a child's heart operation in the UK fell from 4.3% in 2000 to 2.6% in 2009. Plans to reduce the number of centres performing children's heart surgery have been opposed. A report to NHS England in July 2015 proposed a ""three tier"" model for all hospitals providing congenital heart disease care. It suggested that they would work within ""regional, multi-centre networks, bringing together foetal, children’s and adult services"" and noted that since 2001 there ""have been subsequent reviews each making a series of recommendations, but no coordinated programme of change, and concerns have remained"".

Goalball,"Goalball is a team sport designed specifically for athletes with a vision impairment.  Participants compete in teams of three, and try to throw a ball with bells embedded inside it into the opponents' goal.  The ball is thrown by hand and never kicked.  Using ear–hand coordination, originating as a rehabilitation exercise, the sport has no able-bodied equivalent. Sighted athletes are also blindfolded when playing this sport.
Played indoors, usually on a volleyball court, games consist of twelve-minute halves (formerly ten-minute halves) with a three-minute half-time.  Where there is a tie, golden goal overtime occurs in the form of two three-minute periods (and a second three-minute half-time). If the tie persists, a paired shootout ('extra throws' and 'sudden death extra throws') determines the winner. Teams alternate throwing or rolling the ball from one end of the playing area to the other, and players remain in the area of their own goal in both defence and attack. Players must use the sound of the ball to judge its position and movement. Eyeshades allow partially sighted and blind players to compete on an equal footing. Eyepatches may be worn under eyeshades to ensure complete coverage of the eye, and prevent any vision should the eyeshades become dislodged.
The International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), founded in 1981 and responsible for a range of sports for blind and partially sighted people, is the official governing body for the sport.

History
Goalball was originally devised in 1946 by Hans Lorenzen, an Austrian, and Sepp Reindle, a German, as a means of assisting the rehabilitation of visually impaired World War II veterans.
Goalball gradually evolved into a competitive game during the 1950s and 1960s. It was eventually nominated as a demonstration sport at the 1972 Summer Paralympics in Heidelberg, West Germany, and became a Paralympic Games sport at the 1976 Summer Paralympics in Toronto. The sport's first world championship was held in Austria in 1978.
In 2011, the long-standing IBSA Goalball Subcommittee sought to separate from IBSA and form a new international body, the World Goalball Association. IBSA responded by appointing a new committee.
As of 2017, there were 81 competing nations, and 270 international referees.

Essentials
Court and ball
IBSA goalball rules require the field of play to be 18 metres (59 ft) long by 9 metres (30 ft) wide. Goals span the width of the pitch. The court is divided into six even sections, 3 by 9 metres (9.8 by 29.5 ft). At either end, just in front of the goal, is the team area. Beyond that is each team's landing zone. The middle two sections are collectively referred to as the neutral zone.
The lines of the court are made by placing tape over lengths of twine. This makes the line both visual (for officials) and tactile (for players). The team area and landing zone, including the boundary, goal lines and high-ball lines, are always marked in this way. Furthermore, the team area has six hash m",sports
National Socialist German Doctors' League,"The National Socialist German Doctors' League (Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Ärztebund, abbreviated as NSDÄB or NSD-Ärztebund) was a division of the Nazi Party with the mission of integrating the German medical profession within the framework of the Nazi worldview. The organisation was headquartered in Munich. The League was organized (as with other departments of the Nazi Party) strictly in accord with the Führerprinzip (""leader principle"") as well as the principle of Machtdistanz (""power distance""). The League was led by the Reich Health Leader (Reichsärzteführer).

History
The National Socialist German Doctors' League was founded by the Nazi Party on August 3, 1929 on the initiative of the doctor and publisher Ludwig Liebl. He was also the first chairman, with his tenure lasting three years. The NSDÄB's self-image was not that of a representative body, but of a combat organisation. As such, the League developed the essential ""scientific"" foundations of Nazi health policy, which culminated in the racial hygiene concept of annihilation of the ""life unworthy of life"".
The NSDÄB's organizational structure followed that of the Nazi Party. Gerhard Wagner had been the leader of the NSDÄB since 1932, and in 1934 he received the title of Reich Health Leader (Reichsärzteführer). In 1935, he enforced the rigorous synchronization of the medical associations and contributed to the drafting of the Nuremberg Laws. Wagner's proposals included a forced separation of ""mixed marriages"" and a marriage ban for ""quarter Jews""; however, these were not included in the law after Hitler's intervention. After Wagner's sudden death in 1939 at the age of 50, Leonardo Conti took over his position. The NSDÄB ceased operations for the duration of the war on October 13, 1942, when it had around 46,000 members.
After Germany's defeat in World War II, the Nazi Party, its divisions and affiliated groups were declared ""criminal organizations"" and banned by the Allied Control Council on October 10, 1945. Conti, who was to be held accountable for his participation in the Nazi Action T4 in the Nuremberg Trials, hanged himself in his prison cell in October 1945.

Autonomism (political doctrine),"Autonomism is a political doctrine which supports acquiring or preserving political autonomy of a nation or a region. It is not necessarily opposed to federalism, and souverainism necessarily implies autonomism, but not vice versa.
Examples of autonomist parties include Union Nationale, Action démocratique du Québec and its successor Coalition Avenir Québec (Quebec) and recent (2018) Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta (Alberta) in Canada, New Macau Association in China (Macau), Parti progressiste martiniquais (Martinique) in France, Lega Nord in Italy (Northern Italy) and Popular Democratic Party in the United States (Puerto Rico).

Canada
Alberta
In Alberta, the Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta (FCPoA), which was formerly known as Alberta First Party (AFP), Western Freedom Party (WFP), and Separation Party (SP), replaced the party's old ideology Albertan separatism to support promoting Albertan autonomy like Quebec's counterparts, instead as part of the new another changes under then elected Derek Fildebrandt's leadership.
In 2022, the Alberta provincial government passed the Alberta Sovereignty Within a United Canada Act.

Quebec
Autonomism is a policy defended by four Quebec political parties, the Union Nationale (UN), the Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ), its successor Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) and the Équipe Autonomiste (EA), are provincial parties that aim to obtain certain federal capacities and to give the title of autonomous state to the province.

Saskatchewan
The provincial government of Saskatchewan has called for greater provincial autonomy, with premier Scott Moe calling for a ""New Deal with Canada"" and referring to Saskatchewan as a ""nation within a nation"" when discussing a desire for more control over taxation, immigration, and policing. The third party Saskatchewan United Party also supports provincial autonomy.
In 2022, the Saskatchewan provincial government issued a white paper on its stance against ""federal intrusion"" and in 2023 passed Saskatchewan First Act.

Romania
The Székely autonomy movement is supported by local parties representing the Hungarian community and by most of the political parties in Hungary.

Spain
The Autonomous Communities of Spain may demonstrate the doctrine although it is limited in its extent.

Switzerland
The 26 cantons of Switzerland demonstrate autonomism in a federal state. The Swiss Federal Constitution declares the cantons to be sovereign to the extent that it is not limited by federal law. The cantons also retain all powers and competencies not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution.

History of Andean South America,"The history of human habitation in the Andean region of South America stretches from circa 15,000 BCE to the present day. Stretching for 7,000 km (4,300 mi) long, the region encompasses mountainous, tropical and desert environments. This colonisation and habitation of the region has been affected by its unique geography and climate, leading to the development of unique cultural and societal organisations.
After the first humans — who were then arranged into hunter-gatherer tribal groups — arrived in South America via the Isthmus of Panama, they spread out across the continent, with the earliest evidence for settlement in the Andean region dating to circa 15,000 BCE, in what archaeologists call the Lithic Period. In the ensuing Andean preceramic period, plants began to be widely cultivated, and first complex society, Caral-Supe civilization, emerged at 3500 BC, and lasted until 1800 BC. Also, distinct religious centres emerged, such as the Kotosh Religious Tradition in the highlands.
This was followed by the Ceramic Period. Various complex societies developed at this time, such as Chavín culture, lasting from 900 BC to 200 BC, Paracas culture, lasting from 800 BC to 200 BC, its successor Nazca culture, lasting from 200 BC to 800, the Moche civilisation, lasting from 100 to 700, Wari and Tiwanaku Empires, with both lasting from 600 to 1000, and Chimor, lasting from 900 to 1470. In later periods, much of the Andean region was conquered by the indigenous Incas, who in 1438 founded the largest empire that the Americas had ever seen, named Tahuantinsuyu, but usually called Inca Empire. The Inca governed their empire from the capital city of Cuzco, administering it along traditional Andean lines. Inca Empire rose from Kingdom of Cuzco, founded around 1230.
In the 16th century, Spanish colonisers from Europe arrived in the Andes, eventually subjugating the indigenous kingdoms and incorporating the Andean region into the Spanish Empire. In the 19th century, a rising tide of anti-imperialist nationalism that was sweeping all of South America led rebel armies to overthrow Spanish rule.
The Andean region was subsequently divided into a number of new states, Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador.
The 20th century saw the growing influence of the United States in the region, which was increasingly exploited for its natural gas supplies. This in turn led to the rise of a number of anti-imperialist and socialist movements to oppose U.S. and multinational involvement in Andean South America.

Lithic Period: c.15,000 BCE—3500 BCE
The earliest period in which humans inhabited the Andean region was the Lithic period, sometimes alternately called the Early Archaic period. It was a period characterised by the use of stone tools, or lithics, as the main form of technology, and a hunter-gatherer mode of existence.

Ecosystem-based adaptation,"Ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA or EbA) encompasses a broad set of approaches to adapt to climate change. They all involve the management of ecosystems and their services to reduce the vulnerability of human communities to the impacts of climate change. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defines EBA as ""the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change"".
EbA involves the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, mangroves or coral reefs to reduce the harmful impacts of climate hazards including shifting patterns or levels of rainfall, changes in maximum and minimum temperatures, stronger storms, and increasingly variable climatic conditions. EbA measures can be implemented on their own or in combination with engineered approaches (such as the construction of water reservoirs or dykes), hybrid measures (such as artificial reefs) and approaches that strengthen the capacities of individuals and institutions to address climate risks (such as the introduction of early warning systems).
Collaborative planning between scientists, policy makers, and community members is an essential element of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation. By drawing on the expertise of outside experts and local residents alike, EbA seeks to develop unique solutions to unique problems, rather than simply replicating past projects.
EbA is nested within the broader concept of nature-based solutions and complements and shares common elements with a wide variety of other approaches to building the resilience of social-ecological systems. These approaches include community-based adaptation, ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction, climate-smart agriculture, and green infrastructure, and often place emphasis on using participatory and inclusive processes and community/stakeholder engagement. The concept of EbA has been promoted through international fora, including the processes of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the CBD. A number of countries make explicit references to EbA in their strategies for adaptation to climate change and their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.
While the barriers to widespread uptake of EbA by public and private sector stakeholders and decision makers are substantial, cooperation toward generating a greater understanding of the potential of EbA is well established among researchers, advocates, and practitioners from nature conservation and sustainable development groups. EbA is increasingly viewed as an effective means of addressing the linked challenges of climate change and poverty in developing countries, where many people are dependent on natural resources for their lives and livelihoods.

Bagatelle,"Bagatelle (from the Château de Bagatelle) is a billiards-derived indoor table game, the object of which is to get a number of balls (set at nine in the 19th century) past wooden pins (which act as obstacles) into holes that are guarded by wooden pegs; penalties are incurred if the pegs are knocked over.  It probably developed from the table made with raised sides for trou madame, which was also played with ivory balls and continued to be popular into the later 19th century, after which it developed into bar billiards, with influences from the French/Belgian game billard russe (with supposed Russian origins). A bagatelle variant using fixed metal pins, billard japonais, eventually led to the development of pachinko and pinball.

History
Table games involving sticks and balls evolved from efforts to bring outdoor games like ground billiards, croquet, and bowling inside for play during inclement weather. They are attested in general by the 15th century, although the 19th-century idea that bagatelle itself derived from the English ""shovel-board"" described in Charles Cotton's 1674 Compleat Gamester has since been disregarded.

France
In France, during the long 1643–1715 reign of Louis XIV, billiard tables were narrowed, with wooden pins or skittles at one end of the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or cue from the other end, in a game inspired as much by bowling as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed to the table, and holes in the bed of the table became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the harder scorable holes.  Quite a number of variations on this theme were developed.
In 1777, a party was thrown in honour of Louis XVI and the queen at the Château de Bagatelle, recently erected at great expense by the king's brother, the Count of Artois. Bagatelle from Italian bagattella, signifies 'a trifle', 'a decorative thing'. The highlight of the party was a new table game featuring a slender table and cue sticks, which players used to shoot ivory balls up an inclined playfield.  The game was dubbed bagatelle by the count and shortly after swept through France.

UK and US
The name ""bagatelle"" was first used to describe such a game in 1819. Its dimensions soon standardised at 1 ft 9 in x 7 ft (53 cm x 213 cm).  Some French soldiers carried their favorite bagatelle tables with them to America while helping to fight the British in the American Revolutionary War. Bagatelle spread and became so popular in America as well that a political cartoon from 1863 depicts US President Abraham Lincoln playing a small tabletop version of bagatelle against presidential rival George B. McClellan.
As of 2022, bagatelle is still played competitively in the Chester area of Cheshire, England. The Chester and District Bagatelle League is believed to be the last surviving bagatelle league in the world.

Crokicurl,"Crokicurl is a Canadian winter sport invented by Liz Wreford and Leanne Muir of Public City Architecture in 2016 and first played in Winnipeg, Canada. The game is a large scale hybrid of curling and the board game Crokinole.
The related game of crokinole is a game in which the players take turn to flick small discs on a circular board, to score highest depending on where the disc lands on the board where the regions are marked with score.

Play and rules
In crokicurl, rocks are used instead of discs and its rocks are roughly the size of a curling stone. The game uses junior curling stones which are 25 lbs instead of 38 - 44 lbs for regular curling stones.
The game is played by teams consisting of two players, trying to score points by throwing the stones into the center of the ice where the circles are marked. The highest circle is marked with twenty points.

Locations
Crokicurl has spread from Winnipeg all across Canada to small towns and large cities. A list is included below.

Information Age,"The Information Age is a historical period that began in the mid-20th century. It is characterized by a rapid shift from traditional industries, as established during the Industrial Revolution, to an economy centered on information technology. The onset of the Information Age has been linked to the development of the transistor in 1947, and the optical amplifier in 1957. These technological advances have had a significant impact on the way information is processed and transmitted.
According to the United Nations Public Administration Network, the Information Age was formed by capitalizing on computer miniaturization advances, which led to modernized information systems and internet communications as the driving force of social evolution.
There is ongoing debate concerning whether the Third Industrial Revolution has already ended, and if the Fourth Industrial Revolution has already begun due to the recent breakthroughs in areas such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology. This next transition has been theorized to harken the advent of the Imagination Age, the Internet of things (IoT), and rapid advancements in machine learning.

History
The digital revolution converted technology from analog format to digital format. By doing this, it became possible to make copies that were identical to the original. In digital communications, for example, repeating hardware was able to amplify the digital signal and pass it on with no loss of information in the signal. Of equal importance to the revolution was the ability to easily move the digital information between media, and to access or distribute it remotely. One turning point of the revolution was the change from analog to digitally recorded music. During the 1980s the digital format of optical compact discs gradually replaced analog formats, such as vinyl records and cassette tapes, as the popular medium of choice.

Previous inventions
Humans have manufactured tools for counting and calculating since ancient times, such as the abacus, astrolabe, equatorium, and mechanical timekeeping devices. More complicated devices started appearing in the 1600s, including the slide rule and mechanical calculators. By the early 1800s, the Industrial Revolution had produced mass-market calculators like the arithmometer and the enabling technology of the punch card. Charles Babbage proposed a mechanical general-purpose computer called the Analytical Engine, but it was never successfully built, and was largely forgotten by the 20th century and unknown to most of the inventors of modern computers.
The Second Industrial Revolution in the last quarter of the 19th century developed useful electrical circuits and the telegraph. In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith developed electromechanical tabulating and calculating devices using punch cards and unit record equipment, which became widespread in business and government.
Meanwhile, various analog computer systems used electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic systems to model probl",history
Boyd Rush,"Boyd Rusia Rush (July 4, 1895 – January 24, 1964) was an American upholsterer who was the recipient of the world's first heart transplant on January 24, 1964, at University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi.  Furthermore, Boyd's doctor James D. Hardy used a chimpanzee heart since no human donor heart was readily available. This heart beat in Rush's chest for approximately one hour, and then failed. Rush never regained consciousness.

Biography
Rush was born on Independence Day (July 4th), 1895, in Coldwater, Mississippi. During the U.S. draft for World War I, he was living in Enid, Mississippi and working as a day laborer. His physical build was listed as ""stout.""
In 1936, he married Mary Senora ""Nora"" Bridges. In 1942, he and his wife were living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he was working at Jack's Cookie Company.  He has also been described as a ""deaf mute.""

Unsuccessful heart transplant
Background on organ transplants
James Hardy at the University of Mississippi Medical Center had previously performed the world's first transplant of a human lung in June 1963.
Being impressed by the limited success of Keith Reemtsma in transplanting chimpanzee kidneys into human patients, Hardy acquired four chimpanzees instead for the possibility of a heart transplant.  He and the Medical School Dean Robert Marston jointly established conditions for a heart transplant which included that, since the procedure was highly experimental, they could only consider a patient close to death who had no other chance of survival.

Boyd Rush
On January 21, 1964, 68-year old Boyd Rush was transferred to the University of Mississippi Medical Center after being found in a comatose state two nights earlier.  One lower leg was black with gangrene, his face was mottled with blood clots, and he only had a faint pulse.  These symptoms were likely caused by his heart's inability to pump sufficient blood.  Rush had had hypertensive heart disease for years and likely had suffered a heart attack before being found unconscious.
On Jan. 22, Hardy amputated the gangrenous portions of Rush's left leg.
On Jan. 23, it appeared as though Rush might receive a stroke of good luck, for there was a trauma victim in the hospital's ICU who was brain-dead and whose family had given permission for him to be a heart donor. However, the legal definition of death at the time required the heartbeat to stop, and this trauma victim's heart was still beating. At approximately 11:00 pm, Rush went into shock and his blood pressure fell to 60, and Hardy took him into the operating room. Rush's heart stopped just before the team attached him to the heart-lung machine. Hardy then polled the other four doctors regarding whether they should continue with the transplant knowing that they would now use a chimpanzee heart and would likely receive much public criticism.  He asked each doctor quietly, ""Are you prepared to proceed?"" The first doctor agreed, the next abstained, and the last two",medicine
Genoeconomics,"Genoeconomics is an interdisciplinary field of protoscience that aims to combine molecular genetics and economics.
Genoeconomics is based on the idea that economic indicators have a genetic basis — that a person's financial behaviour can be traced to their DNA and that genes are related to economic behaviour. As of 2023, the results have been inconclusive. Some minor correlations may have been identified between genetics and economic preferences.

History
The word genoeconomics was coined in 2007.
The field of economics and the economic indicators used by economists predate the Empiricist Age. Genoeconomics adds biological foundations to these traditional economic indicators.
Quantitative genetic data was not available to researchers until the year 2000, when the human genome was sequenced as part of the Human Genome Project. Genetic milestones of the late 20th and early 21st century, such as the sequencing of the human genome, has spurred interest in research combining economics and genetics.

Background
Genoeconomics involves the study of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The field of genoeconomics uses genetic data to infer economic preferences such as time preference, risk aversion, and educational attainment, as well as macroeconomic data such as per-capita income. For example, genoeconomic methodology was used in a 2012 study of tobacco taxes in the United States, where such taxes vary across jurisdictions, to look at ""the interaction of a single nicotinic receptor and state-level tobacco taxes to predict tobacco use"". Additionally, genoeconomic research in 2013 found that two-fifths of the ""variance of educational attainment is explained by genetic factors"".
Some genoeconomic researchers claim that the economic success of a country can be predicted by its genetic diversity. The American economist Enrico Spolaore says that genoeconomic work could ""reduce barriers to the flows of ideas and innovations across populations"".

Criticism and limitations
Genoeconomic research is prone to the public misconception that genetically-influenced behaviours are separate from environmental factors. The authors of a 2012 paper said that their work ""is not about a nature or nurture debate"".
Nature published an online article written in 2012 about the various reactions on the subject. The field is criticized by biologists for lacking methodological rigour, drawing conclusions about causation based on causal correlation, and working with small sample sizes. The political implications of the field are also a concern for some scientists; anticipating the publication of a genoeconomics article in the journal American Economic Review, a group of scientists and social scientists wrote an open letter which said that ""the suggestion that an ideal level of genetic variation could foster economic growth and could even be engineered has the potential to be misused with frightening consequences to justify indefensible practices such as ethnic cleansing or genocide",economics
Urban history,"Urban history is a field of history that examines the historical nature of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like social history, architectural history, urban sociology, urban geography, business history, and archaeology. Urbanization and industrialization were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of modernization, or the transformation of rural traditional societies.
The history of urbanization focuses on the processes of by which existing populations concentrate in urban localities over time, and on the social, political, cultural and economic contexts of cities. Most urban scholars focus on the ""metropolis,"" a large or especially important city. There is much less attention to small cities, towns or (until recently) suburbs. However social historians find small cities much easier to handle because they can use census data to cover or sample the entire population.  In the United States from the 1920s to the 1990s many of the most influential monographs began as one of the 140 PhD dissertations at Harvard University directed by Arthur Schlesinger, Sr. (1888-1965) or Oscar Handlin (1915-2011).  The field grew rapidly after 1970, leading one prominent scholar, Stephan Thernstrom, to note that urban history apparently deals with cities, or with city-dwellers, or with events that transpired in cities, with attitudes toward cities – which makes one wonder what is not urban history.

Comparative studies
Only a handful of studies attempt a global history of cities, notably Lewis Mumford, The City in History (1961).  Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, The European City (1993);  Christopher R. Friedrichs, The Early Modern City, 1450-1750 (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. Edo and Paris (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).
Architectural history is its own field but occasionally overlaps with urban history.
The political role of cities in helping state formation—and in staying independent—is the theme of Charles Tilly and W. P. Blockmans, eds., Cities and the Rise of States in Europe, A.D. 1000 to 1800 (1994).  Comparative elite studies—who was in power—are typified by Luisa Passerini, Dawn Lyon, Enrica Capussotti and Ioanna Laliotou, eds. Who Ran the Cities? City Elites and Urban Power Structures in Europe and North America, 1750-1940 (2008) .  Labor activists and socialists often had national or international networks that circulated ideas and tactics.

Great Britain
In the 1960s, the historiography of Victorian towns and cities began to flourish in Britain. Much attention focused first on the Victorian city, with topics ranging from demography, public health, the working-class, and local culture. In recent decades, topics regarding class, capitalism, and social structure gave way to studies of the cultural history of urban life, as well as the study of groups su",history
Terence English,"Sir Terence Alexander Hawthorne English  (born October 1932) is a South African-born British retired cardiac surgeon. He was consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Papworth Hospital and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1973–1995. After starting a career in mining engineering, English switched to medicine and went on to lead the team that performed Britain's first successful heart transplant in August 1979 at Papworth, and soon established it as one of Europe's leading heart–lung transplant programmes.
Born into a family of mixed Irish, Afrikaans, Yorkshire and Scottish descendants, English's father died at age 49, leaving his mother to bring up two children in South Africa. After completing a degree in Mining Engineering in Johannesburg, he was inspired by a maternal uncle, who was a surgeon, to study medicine, and with the financial aid of an unexpected legacy travelled to London. After completing his medical training at Guy's Hospital Medical School, he was stimulated by the pioneering open heart surgery taking place in the 1960s and he embarked on a career in cardiac surgery and then specialised in cardiac transplantation.
English became president of the Royal College of Surgeons 1989–92, Master of St Catharine's College 1993–2000, Deputy Lieutenant for Cambridgeshire 1994–2001 and president of the British Medical Association 1995–1996. A member of the General Medical Council (GMC) (1983–1989), he has also been president of International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation 1984–1985 and holds multiple international honorary fellowships and Doctorates of medical colleges and universities. He was knighted, KBE in 1991.

Early life and education
Terence English was born in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, to Mavis and Arthur English. He has an older sister called Elizabeth. Arthur English died from silicosis when Sir Terence was two years old.

School
English went to Parktown Preparatory School for boys in Johannesburg and at the age of ten was sent to board at Cordwallis school in Pietermaritzburg and in 1946 completed his schooling at Hilton College in Natal.

Engineering and university, mining to medicine
After leaving school at the age of seventeen, English worked for a year in what was then Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as a diamond driller with the Cementation Company (Africa) Ltd on a dam near Salisbury (now Harare). This skill was useful in providing opportunities for summer jobs while he was studying for a BSc in mining engineering at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, which he completed in 1954.
His qualifications later provided opportunities for employment in mining exploration in Northern Quebec and the Yukon.

Medical school
In his penultimate year of engineering, he unexpectedly inherited £2,000 from a family trust and decided this would enable him to change to medicine and spend his professional career as a doctor rather than an engineer. English applied to Guy's Medical School and was accepted by the Dean, George Houston pr",medicine
Cestoball,"Cestoball is a dynamic team sport that originated in Argentina in 1897, developed by Professor Enrique Romero Brest, a pioneer in Argentine physical education. Initially called pelota al cesto (ball to basket), it was officially incorporated into the national physical education curriculum in 1903. The sport underwent modernization in 1986, evolving to include faster gameplay and higher engagement, leading to its rebranding as Cestoball.
Cestoball is played on a rectangular court measuring 28 by 16 meters, with a basket located at each end. Each team fields six players on the court, with a total roster of 12 players to allow for substitutions. Unlike basketball, the ball in Cestoball does not bounce, and players advance it through passing. The objective is to score by shooting the ball into the opponent's basket, which is uniquely positioned five meters from the end line, allowing for scoring from all sides.
In recent years, Cestoball has gained traction internationally, particularly in regions such as Asia and Africa. In India, the sport is being promoted by enthusiasts like Mohamed Aquib from Bangalore, who helped establish the Cestoball Federation of India and the Asian Cestoball Federation. These organizations aim to secure recognition from national sports authorities and the Indian Olympic Association, with efforts to integrate the sport into school and university programs.

Sinuca brasileira,"Sinuca brasileira (Portuguese for Brazilian snooker), often simply called sinuca, is a cue sport played on a snooker table, using only one red ball instead of snooker's fifteen, with the normal six colours of the standard set of snooker balls. Each ball carries the same basic point value as in snooker.  As  with other pocket billiards games, a white cue ball is used to pot the red and other coloured balls. The game is played almost exclusively in Brazil and is little known outside this region.

Rules
Ball values are the same as in standard snooker (red = 1, yellow = 2, green = 3, brown = 4, blue = 5, pink = 6, black = 7) and points are awarded to a player after the corresponding ball is legally potted.
The colours are set up on their normal spots as in snooker, while the sole red ball is placed halfway between the pink ball and the right side cushion. The cue ball is placed in the ""D"". The opening player may move the ball anywhere within the ""D"" before playing. The first shot must be played so that the red ball is contacted; however, it is not permitted to either pocket the red ball or leave the opponent snookered. The opponent then has choice of shot.
Taken in turns, each player has a choice to either take a free shot (shoot for the ball on the table with the lowest point value) or a penalty shot (shoot for any other ball). 
All shots are called, that is the player must indicate which ball they wish to pot and which pocket they are aiming for. 
If a free shot is made, the player is awarded the ball's point value, the ball remains off the table, and the player can choose any remaining ball on the table as a second free shot; if that ball is made, the player receives its point value and the ball is respotted. 
The player now once again has the choice of either a free shot or a penalty shot. A miss on a free shot incurs no penalty, but does end the player's turn. 
If a penalty shot is chosen, and the shot is made, the player is awarded the ball's point value and the ball is respotted. The player then has to play a free shot. If a penalty shot is missed, it constitutes a foul and the opponent is awarded 7 points. 
If an in-off foul (where the cue ball is accidentally potted) occurs, the incoming opponent will get the points and receive ball-in-hand, permitting placement of the cue ball anywhere within the ""D"" before their next shot. 
All other rules are the same as in snooker, although plants, cannons and other combination shots are automatically illegal because all the balls are different colours.

Byzantine Dark Ages,"Byzantine Dark Ages is a historiographical term for the period in the history of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, from around c.630 to the 760,s, which marks the transition between the late antique early Byzantine period and the ""medieval"" middle Byzantine era. The ""Dark Ages"" are characterized by widespread upheavals and transformation of the Byzantine state and society, resulting in a paucity of primary historical sources.

Collapse
The 7th century was a watershed in the history of the Byzantine Empire. At its beginning, the Eastern Roman Empire still controlled most of the Mediterranean Basin's shores and faced the Sassanian Empire as its main eastern rival. The Fall of the Western Roman Empire had eroded this traditional order, and despite Emperor Justinian I's wars of reconquest in the 6th century, many of his gains in Italy and Spain were quickly undone. But it was still recognizably the late antique world dominated by the Roman Empire, with the Mediterranean mare nostrum as its center of gravity and cities as the main social and economic unit. 
The final Byzantine-Sassanid War weakened this world, but the Muslim conquests of the 7th century shattered it for good. The emergent caliphate was not only far more powerful and threatening than Persia had ever been, but it also shattered the political unity of the Mediterranean world and moved the center of power east, first to Damascus and then to Baghdad. Byzantium was left territorially crippled, reduced to the status of a peripheral power, and on a permanent defensive against invaders from all sides.

Transformation
This crisis led to a profound transformation in the nature and culture of the Byzantine state, that was not completed until the 9th century, when the Muslim pressure on the Empire slackened. The Byzantine state that emerged ""was an empire and culture focused on emperor and capital."" It was also much more militarized: The civilian late-antiquity administrative structure, put in place by Diocletian and his successors, was replaced by the themes, each governed by a military commander (strategos, ""general""). The rigid distinction between civilian and military hierarchies, which was a hallmark of the late antique system, was thus abolished. With the territorial losses reducing the Empire to its core territories in Anatolia and parts of the Balkans, the administration was streamlined, with the central government essentially absorbing the old provincial administration of the praetorian prefectures into a centralized, court-centered hierarchy. In the process, the handful of great departments of late antiquity were replaced by a series of smaller, more narrowly focused fiscal bureaus, all of roughly equal status. Another change was that Greek also finally replaced Latin as the language of administration during this period.
The Muslim conquests, coupled with the Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe around the same time, resulted in the breakdown of the late-antiquity social order. I",history
Terminal lucidity,"Terminal lucidity (also known as rallying, terminal rally, the rally, end-of-life-experience, energy surge, the surge, or pre-mortem surge) is an unexpected return of consciousness, mental clarity, or memory shortly before death in individuals with severe psychiatric or neurological disorders. It has been reported by physicians since the 19th century. Terminal lucidity is a narrower term than the phenomenon paradoxical lucidity where return of mental clarity can occur anytime (not just before death). However, as of 2025, terminal lucidity is not considered a medical term and there is no official consensus on the identifying characteristics.
Terminal lucidity is a poorly understood phenomenon in the context of medical and psychological research, and there is no consensus on what the underlying mechanisms are. It can occur even in cases of severe, irreversible damage or degeneration to the brain, making its existence a challenge to the irreversibility paradigm of degenerative dementias.
Studying terminal lucidity presents ethical challenges due to the need for informed consent.  Care providers also face ethical challenges of whether to provide deep sedation, which might limit terminal lucidity, and how to respond to requests for a change in care plans from family members.

History
Several case reports in the 19th century described the unusual condition of an improvement and recovery of the mental state in people days or weeks before death. In 1887, William Munk called the phenomenon ""lightening up before death"".
According to historical reviews headed by the biologist Michael Nahm, the phenomenon has been noted in individuals with diseases which cause progressive cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, but also schizophrenia, tumors, strokes, meningitis, and Parkinson's disease. This makes terminal lucidity a phenomenon that is difficult to classify. Researchers are unclear if the phenomenon occurs in all people regardless of their medical history. In 2018, a group of researchers at Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital published a study involving the observation of people weeks prior to death. Out of 151 deaths, six people experienced terminal lucidity. These six had different admission causes, and upon admission three of them were alert and aware and the other three were drowsy. The most common causes of death among these people were different infectious diseases or cancer complications. A survey of 45 Canadian palliative care volunteers reported that 33% of them personally witnessed at least one case of terminal lucidity within the past year.
According to Nahm, it may be present even in cases of people with previous mental disability. Nahm defines two subtypes: one that comes gradually (a week before death), and another that comes rapidly (hours before death), with the former occurring more often than the latter. There are many cases reported in literature, although the phrase terminal lucidity was coined in 2009. Interest in this conditio",medicine
Downball,"Downball, also recognised as handball or four-square, is a ball game popular in Australian schools. It is also commonly played by the broader Australian population.
The game can be played with a rubber high bounce ball or a tennis ball. Players take turns using their hands to hit the ball against a wall until a player misses a shot and is eliminated. The last player left is declared the winner, and the next round begins.
There are several versions of the game, one involving the playing area being divided into four squares (marked by simply placing a stick in the centre so that players can divide the space mentally). When a player is eliminated, an onlooker previously in the line (also referred  to as the ries (firstry, secondry and so on) takes their place.
In an unofficial setting, the game can be adapted to any environments where square/rectangular-lined flat grounds can be found, including parking lots, driveways and footpaths, commonly playing with a tennis ball.

Downball Australia
Downball Australia was founded in February 2020 by a 16-year-old student named Noah, originally as year 9 school project. ABC have described it as Australia's first officially recognised Downball organisation.
Downball Australia rules say to play the game on a flat indoor or outdoor court, with connected lined square zones of 1.8 by 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in × 5 ft 11 in), with matches involving between four and seven players.

Statistics,"Statistics (from German: Statistik, orig. ""description of a state, a country"") is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as ""all people living in a country"" or ""every atom composing a crystal"". Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.
When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation.
Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences made using mathematical statistics employ the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.
A standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: Type I errors (null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true, giving a ""false positive"") and Type II errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is in fact false, giving a ""false negative""). Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework, ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate ",science
Deadliest Enemy,"Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs is a non-fiction book by epidemiologist Michael T. Osterholm and writer Mark Olshaker, that explores public health emergencies including antimicrobial resistance, emerging infectious disease, and the threat of an influenza pandemic. It proposes a nine-point ""battle plan for survival"" for dealing with these threats, including solutions to antimicrobial drug resistance.
The book also focuses on the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), toxic shock syndrome, Zika, Ebola, bioterrorism, influenza research, and the antivaccine movement.
The book was first published in March 2017 by Little, Brown and Company.

Synopsis
Michael Osterholm describes his book as ""part history, part current affairs, and part blueprint for the future"". Top of his concerns are influenza pandemics, antibiotic resistance and bioterrorism, combined with ""no clear international governance structure for how we are going to deal with these issues"". Focusing on major infectious diseases, he highlights the world's vulnerability to their emerging threats. His concerns include the effects of major outbreaks on medicine and vaccine production, should countries where these are produced be affected.
Content includes a chapter on coronaviruses titled, ""SARS and MERS: Harbingers of Things to Come"". Other chapters are on the HIV/AIDS, toxic shock syndrome, the 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic, and Ebola outbreaks, covering all the main outbreaks over the previous 30 years, including influenza bioterrorism, Gain-of-function research, influenza research, the antivaccine movement, and antimicrobial resistance. The concept of ""game-changing influenza vaccines"" is introduced in the chapter ""Taking influenza off the table"". This provides reasoning and mechanisms for developing vaccines. Solutions to antimicrobial drug resistance are suggested in the chapter titled ""Fighting the resistance"".
The authors divide infectious diseases into four classes: pathogens that have the potential to cause pandemics; pathogens important to particular regions; endemic diseases; and bioterrorism, dual-use research of concern, and concerns over gain-of-function research, where modifying pathogens in the laboratory might potentially be misused.
The book contains personal experiences, including Osterholm's La Crosse encephalitis, and it uses medical history to assess the threat of pandemics and anti-microbial resistance, while also discussing political responses. The authors propose a nine-point ""Battle Plan for Survival"" to fight emerging threats, with the aim of informing and inspiring people into public health work.

Reception
The book was described by Richard Preston as a ""powerful and necessary book"" that ""offers us not just fear but plans"". John M. Barry described the book as Osterholm's way of getting results.
Frank Weimann described the book's ""dismal introduction on the threat of epidemics"" and the ma",medicine
Canadian football,"Canadian football, or simply football, is a sport in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete on a field 110 yards (101 m) long and 65 yards (59 m) wide, attempting to advance a pointed oval-shaped ball into the opposing team's end zone.
Canadian and American football have shared origins and are closely related, but have some major differences.  
Rugby football, from which Canadian football developed, was first recorded in Canada in the early 1860s, taken there by British immigrants, possibly in 1824. Both the Canadian Football League (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and Football Canada, the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1880 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union.
The CFL is the most popular and only major professional Canadian football league. Its championship game, the Grey Cup, is one of Canada's biggest sporting events, attracting a large television audience.
Canadian football is also played at high school, junior, collegiate, and semi-professional levels: the Canadian Junior Football League and Quebec Junior Football League are for players aged 18–22,
post-secondary institutions compete in U Sports football for the Vanier Cup, and seniors in the Alberta Football League. The Canadian Football Hall of Fame is in Hamilton, Ontario.

History
The first documented football match was a practice game played on November 9, 1861, at University College, University of Toronto (approximately 400 yards or 370 metres west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was Sir William Mulock, later chancellor of the school. A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.
The first written account of a game played was on October 15, 1862, on the Montreal Cricket Grounds. It was between the First Battalion Grenadier Guards and the Second Battalion Scots Fusilier Guards resulting in a win by the Grenadier Guards 3 goals, 2 rouges to nothing. In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on rugby football. The game gradually gained a following, with the Hamilton Football Club (later the Hamilton Tiger-Cats) formed on November 3, 1869. Montreal Football Club was formed on April 8, 1872. Toronto Argonaut Football Club was formed on October 4, 1873, and the Ottawa Football Club (later the Ottawa Rough Riders) on September 20, 1876. Of those clubs, only the Toronto club is still in continuous operation today.
This rugby-football soon became popular at Montreal's McGill University. McGill challenged Harvard University to a two-game series in 1874, using a hybrid game of English rugby devised by the University of McGill.
The first attempt to establish a proper governing body and to adopt the current set of Rugby rules was the Foot Ball Association of Canada, organized o",sports
Information and communications technology in Kosovo,"Information and communication technology (ICT) in Kosovo has experienced a remarkable development since 1999. From being almost non-existent 10 years ago, Kosovar companies in the information technology (IT) domain offer today wide range of ICT services to their customers both local as well as to foreign companies. Kosovo has the youngest population in Europe, with advanced knowledge in ICT.
Today, public and private education institutions in the IT field, through certified learning curricula by companies such as CISCO and Microsoft, provide education to thousands of young Kosovars while the demand for this form of training is still rising.
Kosovo has two authorized mobile network operators and is the only country in the region not having awarded any UMTS license. Kosovo has neither awarded licenses for fixed wireless access, nor made the 900 and 1800 MHz bands technology neutral. Currently around 1,200,000 customers of ""Vala"" Post and Telecom of Kosovo (PTK). As of March 2007 the second GSM license granted to IPKO – Telekom Slovenije. Currently IPKO has over 1,000,000 users. Following the Brussels Agreement, Kosovo has its own telephone dialing code: +383. Before this assignment, network operators in Kosovo used either +377 (Monaco) or +386 (Slovenia). All other codes were to have been superseded by the new code on 15 January 2017, but some are still in use.
The infrastructure of ICT sector in Kosovo is mainly built of microwave network, optic and coaxial cable (DOCSIS). The telecom industry is liberalized and legislation is introduced adopting European Union regulatory principles and promoting competition. Some of the main internet providers are PTK, IPKO, Kujtesa and Artmotion.

History
First ICT companies in Kosovo can be found as early 1984, these companies where mainly focused on radio telecommunication and audio-video systems, while in early and mid '90s more companies were created, mainly specializing in personal computer sales. ICT industry in Kosovo boomed after 1999 with a lot of new companies being created, among which IPKO which now one of the major telecommunication providers and one of the biggest foreign investments in Kosovo.

Index-based insurance,"Index-based insurance, also known as index-linked insurance, weather-index insurance or, simply, index insurance, is primarily used in agriculture. Because of the high cost of assessing losses, traditional insurance based on paying indemnities for actual losses incurred is usually not viable, particularly for smallholders in developing countries. With index-based insurance, payouts are related to an “index” that is closely correlated to agricultural production losses, such as one based on rainfall, yield or vegetation levels (e.g. pasture for livestock). Payouts are made when the index exceeds a certain threshold, often referred to as a “trigger”. By making payouts according to an index instead of individual claims, providers can circumvent the transaction costs associated with claims assessments. Index-based insurance is therefore not designed to protect farmers against every peril, but only where there is a widespread risk that significantly influences a farmer’s livelihood. Many such indices now make use of satellite imagery.

Uses for index-based insurance
Traditional insurance schemes are susceptible to morally hazardous behaviors. To ensure that a given claim is legitimate, time and resources must be allocated to adequately audit the losses or damages incurred from an event. Index-based insurance attempts to reduce costs by circumventing the issue of moral hazard, thereby eliminating the administrative costs of claims auditing. This is possible because index-based insurance insures against risks that can not significantly be manipulated through human intervention (e.g. extreme weather). Unlike other insurance, adverse events cannot easily be predicted statistically, large numbers of people tend to be affected at the same time (known as ""concurrency"" by the insurance industry) and losses for each of them tend to be significant. The opposite is the case for more traditional insurance such as home theft insurance, where actuaries can make a good forecast of the likely incidence of claims, thefts are (relatively) rare, all the houses on a block are not entered at the same time, and entire contents of a house are not usually stolen.

Agriculture
Insuring risk in small-scale agriculture faces particular problems that are not usually encountered by the broader insurance sector. Production relies on natural conditions, such as rain, temperature, and sunlight, which cannot be controlled easily by poorer farmers, other than by those with access to irrigation or plastic tunnels in the case of horticultural crops. Consequently farmers face problems on a regular basis.
Traditional insurance has two cost categories. First is the underlying risk that is being insured and, second, the costs involved in operating the insurance, such as carrying out individual risk assessments and loss adjustments. In the agricultural sector these costs tend to be high and premiums are often unaffordable for most poorer farmers. The fixed costs of loss verification make it u",economics
Speed-ball,"Speed-Ball (Arabic: كرة السرعة / [kurat.assurʕa]) is a racquet sport invented in Egypt in 1961 by Mohamed Lotfy, father of Hussein Lotfy (first world champion) and Ahmad Lotfy (the present president of FISB), for the training of beginner tennis players. Today it is a sport in its own right, enjoying popularity not only in Egypt but in other countries. Several of these countries make up the International Federation of Speed-Ball (FISB).

Description
A hollow ball in latex revolves around a metallic mast (1,70m high) which is linked by a nylon thread (fishing thread type) of 1,70m length. The thread is knotted to the mast by a loop or a plastic ring freely revolving around a reel. The mast is fixed in a base from 40 kg to 90 kg. The ball is elliptic and is hit with a rigid plastic racquet with a small handle and a strings around 25 cm of diameter. The speed-ball court is about 6x4 m. for the single match and 8x6 m. for the doubles.

Rules for speed-ball
Speed-ball is played alone (super-solo), with two players (single match), or with four players (double match or relay).

Super-solo
In Super-solo, the aim is to hit the ball a maximum times in one minute. At first with the right hand, then a minute again with the left hand, then with two racquets in fore-hand only,  then with two racquets in back-hand only. The number of hits of each movement is added to make the final score of the solo.
The duration of one movement is  30 seconds for the players under 14 years old and one minute for older players. A break of 30 seconds for all classes is granted behind each movement.
The best players can do up to 160 hits in one minute.
The current men's world record is 621 hits,  set by Egypt's Mohammed Nagy, while the women's record of 539 hits set by Egyptian Noha AbouZeid in the 26th world championship In Kuwait.

Single match
The single match is played by two players, each with one racquet. Each player has their own ground, separated by a neutral strip 60 cm wide (the diameter of the speed-ball's base). A match is divided into games of 10 points. The players attempt to hit the ball once each in turn, inverting its direction of rotation. To score points, the ball must pass twice successively across the opponent's ground, without the opponent being able to return it. If there is a fault, the point is missed and there is a new service. The service is alternated according to who wins each point. The first player to score 10 points wins the game. The first player who wins two games (three games for men's seniors) wins the match.

Double match
The double match takes place like the single, in two teams of two players. In each team, the players serve and hit the ball alternatively. The general rules are the same as the single.
Specific mistakes involve the player's rotation and reception of the ball.

Federation
The International Federation of Speed-Ball (FISB) was founded in 1985 by the membership of Egypt, France, and Japan. Several other countries have since joined",sports
Computer science,"Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). 
Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.
The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.
The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated. The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.

History
The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.
Wilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623. In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner. Leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, because of various reasons, including the fact that he documented the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gav",science
Product ecosystem theory,"Product ecosystem theory is an emerging theory that describes how the design of manufactured products evolves over time and draws parallels with how species evolve within a natural ecosystem. Fundamental to this theory is that manufactured product lines respond to external threats and opportunities in much the same way that species respond to threats and opportunities. Competition and other environmental pressures may cause a species to become extinct. An example of the parallel in consumer products is the way in which the typewriter became displaced (or extinct) due to pressures from the personal computer. 
Products lines can be seen to incrementally change and branch over time following the principle of phyletic gradualism. Or they can be seen to have periods of stasis followed by disruptive innovation. This follows the principle of punctuated equilibrium.
Ecosystem Theory provides a conceptual framework that helps designers and others understand the mechanisms underpinning product innovation in a tangible and visual way. 
Technology change is one of the environmental variables that provide both opportunity and threat for products in much the same way that environmental variables such as climate provide opportunity and threat for species.
Evaluating designed products from this perspective is useful as it shows that the value of a product is not contained entirely within the product itself. Value is also obtained from the rest of the ecosystem.

History and usage of the term
The term was first used in this context by Tim Williams in 2013 in a paper he wrote with Marianella Chamorro-Koc. This paper proposed a methodology for understanding the difficulties of implementation for disruptive innovation based on a case study of the MIT City Car. The term has been used non-specifically prior to this on a number of occasions.

Demonyms for the United States,"People from the United States of America are known as and refer to themselves as Americans. Different languages use different terms for citizens of the United States. All forms of English refer to US citizens as Americans, a term deriving from the United States of America, the country's official name. In the English context, it came to refer to inhabitants of British America, and then the United States. There is some linguistic ambiguity over this use due to the other senses of the word American, which can also refer to people from the Americas in general. Other languages, including French, Japanese, and Russian, use cognates of American to refer to people from the United States. In contrast, others, particularly, Spanish and Portuguese, primarily use terms derived from United States or North America. There are various other local and colloquial names for Americans. The name America came from the Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci.

Development of the term American
Amerigo Vespucci first demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as conjectured by Christopher Columbus, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to the peoples of the Old World. Martin Waldseemüller coined the term America (in honor of Vespucci) in a 1507 world map.
First uses of the adjective American referenced European settlements in the New World. Americans referred to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and subsequently to European settlers and their descendants. English use of the term American for people of European descent dates to the 17th century, with the earliest recorded appearance being in Thomas Gage's The English-American: A New Survey of the West Indies in 1648. In English, American came to be applied especially to people in British America and thus its use as a demonym for the United States derives by extension.
The United States Declaration of Independence of 1776 refers to ""the thirteen united [sic] States of America"", making the first formal use of the country name, which was officially adopted in 1777 by the nation's first governing constitution, the Articles of Confederation. The Federalist Papers of 1787–1788, written by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison to advocate the ratification of the United States Constitution, use the word American in both its original Pan-American sense, but also in its United States sense: Federalist Paper 24 refers to the ""American possessions"" of Britain and Spain (i.e. land outside of the United States) while Federalist Papers 51 and 70 refer to the United States as ""the American republic"". People from the United States increasingly referred to themselves as Americans through the end of the 18th century and the 1795 Treaty of Peace and Amity with the Barbary States refers to ""American Citizens"" while George Washington spoke to his people of ""[t]he name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity"" in his 1796 farewell address.",politics
Age of Sail,"The Age of Sail is a period in European history that lasted at the latest from the mid-16th (or mid-15th) to the mid-19th centuries, in which the dominance of sailing ships in global trade and warfare culminated, particularly marked by the introduction of naval artillery, and ultimately reached its highest extent at the advent of steam power. Enabled by the advances of the related age of navigation, it is identified as a distinctive element of the early modern period and the Age of Discovery.

Periodization
Like most periodic eras, defining the age is inexact and serves only as a general description. The term is used differently for warships and merchant vessels.
By the 14th century naval artillery was employed in Europe, documented at the Battle of Arnemuiden (1338). The 15th century saw the Iberian naval ventures all the way along the African Atlantic coast and across the Atlantic Ocean, starting the Age of Discovery.
For warships, the age of sail runs roughly from the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the last significant engagement in which oar-propelled galleys played a major role, to the development of steam-powered warships.

Golden Age of Sail
The period between the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity (e.g. clippers and windjammers), is sometimes referred to as the ""Golden Age of Sail"".

Decline
The second sea-going steamboat was Richard Wright's first steamboat Experiment, an ex-French lugger; she steamed from Leeds to Yarmouth in July 1813. The first iron steamship to go to sea was the 116-ton Aaron Manby, built in 1821 by Aaron Manby at the Horseley Ironworks, and became the first iron-built vessel to put to sea when she crossed the English Channel in 1822, arriving in Paris on 22 June. She carried passengers and freight to Paris in 1822 at an average speed of 8 knots (9 mph, 14 km/h). 
The first purpose-built steam battleship was the 90-gun Napoléon in 1850. Multiple steam battleships saw action during the Crimean War, especially the Allied (British, French and Ottoman) fleet Bombardment of Sevastopol as part of the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855). The first ironclad battleship, Gloire, was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. In the March 1862 Battle of Hampton Roads, the ironclad CSS Virginia fought USS Monitor, making this the first fight between ironclads.
The Suez Canal in the Middle East, which opened in 1869, was more practical for steamships than for sailing ships, achieving a much shorter European-Asian sea route, which coincided with more fuel-efficient steamships, starting with Agamemnon in 1865.
By 1873, the Age of Sail for warships had ended, with HMS Devastation commissioned in 1871. Devastation was the first class of ocean-going battleships that did not carry sails.

Sailing ships continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s and 1930s, though steamships soon pushed them out of those trades as well. Sailin",history

Kaitai Shinsho,"Kaitai Shinsho (解体新書, Kyūjitai: 解體新書, roughly meaning ""New Text on Anatomy"") is a medical text translated into Japanese during the Edo period. It was written by Sugita Genpaku, and was published by Suharaya Ichibee (須原屋市兵衛) in 1774, the third year of An'ei. The body comprises four volumes, the illustrations, one. The contents are written kanbun-style. It is based on the Dutch-language translation Ontleedkundige Tafelen, often known in Japan as Tafel Anatomie (ターヘル・アナトミア, Tāheru Anatomia), of Johann Adam Kulmus’ Latin Tabulae Anatomicae, published before 1722 (exact year is unknown) in Gdańsk, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. As a full-blown translation from a Western language, it was the first of its kind in Japan.

Background
On 4 March 1771, the eighth year of Meiwa, the students of Rangaku medicine Sugita Genpaku, Maeno Ryōtaku, Nakagawa Jun'an, et al., by studying performing autopsies on criminals executed at the Kozukappara execution grounds (now, there is a possibility that Katsuragawa Hoshū was at this facility as well, but from the description in Rangaku Koto Hajime (蘭学事始), it seems more likely that he was not). Both Sugita and Maeno had the book Ontleedkundige Tafelen, imported from Holland. Sugita, marveling at the accuracy of the work while comparing it by eye with his autopsies, proposed to Maeno that it be translated. For some time, Sugita had a desire to translate something from Dutch; now he would get approval for this. He met with Maeno the very next day (5 March) and began translation. The one who recommended Kaitai Shinsho to the shōgun was Katsuragawa Hosan.
At first, Sugita and Nakagawa could not actually read Dutch; even with Maeno who could, their Dutch vocabulary was inadequate. It would have been difficult for them to consult with the Dutch translations and translators (Tsūji) in Nagasaki, and naturally there were no dictionaries at the time. A translation from any other Western language would have been out of the question, as the government of the time did not allow contact with any other Western nation. Therefore, in a process comparable to cryptanalysis, they progressed with translation work. In his later years, Sugita would detail the process in Rangaku Koto Hajime.
In the second year of An'ei (1773), as they arrived at a translation goal, in order to ascertain society's and above all the authorities' response, they released the ""Anatomical Diagrams"" (解体約図, Kaitai Yakuzu), a five-page flyer.
In 1774, Kaitai Shinsho was published.

Influences
Maeno Ryōtaku was at the center of the translation work, but his name is only mentioned in the dedication written by the famous interpreter Yoshio Kōsaku. By one account, Maeno was on the way to study at Nagasaki; when he prayed at a Tenman-gū for the fulfillment of his studies, he vowed not to study in order to raise his own name, so he abstained from submitting it. By another account, since he knew that the completed works were not completely perfect, the academic Maeno could not ",medicine
Cold War,"The Cold War was a period of global geopolitical rivalry between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) and their respective allies, the capitalist Western Bloc and communist Eastern Bloc, which lasted from 1947 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The term cold war is used because there was no direct fighting between the two superpowers, though each supported opposing sides in regional conflicts known as proxy wars. In addition to the struggle for ideological and economic influence and an arms race in both conventional and nuclear weapons, the Cold War was expressed through technological rivalries such as the Space Race, espionage, propaganda campaigns, embargoes, and sports diplomacy.
After the end of World War II in 1945, during which the US and USSR had been allies, the USSR installed satellite governments in its occupied territories in Eastern Europe and North Korea by 1949, resulting in the political division of Europe (and Germany) by an ""Iron Curtain"". The USSR tested its first nuclear weapon in 1949, four years after their use by the US at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and allied with the People's Republic of China, founded in 1949. The US declared the Truman Doctrine of ""containment"" of communism in 1947, launched the Marshall Plan in 1948 to assist Western Europe's economic recovery, and founded the NATO military alliance in 1949 (matched by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact in 1955). The Berlin Blockade of 1948 to 1949 was an early confrontation, as was the Korean War of 1950 to 1953, which ended in a stalemate. 
US involvement in regime change during the Cold War included support for anti-communist and right-wing dictatorships and uprisings, while Soviet involvement included the funding of left-wing parties, wars of independence, and dictatorships. As nearly all the colonial states underwent decolonization, many became Third World battlefields of the Cold War. Both powers used economic aid in an attempt to win the loyalty of non-aligned countries. The Cuban Revolution of 1959 installed the first communist regime in the Western Hemisphere, and in 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis began after deployments of US missiles in Europe and Soviet missiles in Cuba; it is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into nuclear war. Another major proxy conflict was the Vietnam War of 1955 to 1975, which ended in defeat for the US. 
The USSR solidified its domination of Eastern Europe with its crushing of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Relations between the USSR and China broke down by 1961, with the Sino-Soviet split bringing the two states to the brink of war amid a border conflict in 1969. In 1972, the US initiated diplomatic contacts with China and the US and USSR signed a series of treaties limiting their nuclear arsenals during a period known as détente. In 1979, the toppling of US-allied governments in Iran and Nicaragua and the outbreak of the Soviet–Af",history
Silivri,"Silivri, formerly Selymbria (Greek: Σηλυμβρία), is a municipality and district of Istanbul Province, Turkey. Its population is 217,163 (2022). It lies along the Sea of Marmara, outside the urban core of Istanbul, containing many holiday and weekend homes for residents of the city. The largest settlement in the district is also named Silivri.
Silivri is located bordering Büyükçekmece to the east, Çatalca to the north, Çorlu and Marmara Ereğli (both districts of Tekirdağ Province) to the west, Çerkezköy to the north-west (one of Tekirdağ Province) and with the Sea of Marmara to the south. It is, with an area of 858 km2 (331 sq mi), the second largest district of Istanbul Province after Çatalca. The seat of the district is the city of Silivri.
Established in 2008, Turkey's most modern (and Europe's largest) prison complex is located 9 km (5.6 mi) west of Silivri.

History
Ancient
Silivri, the ancient Greek Selymbria or Selybria (Greek: Σηλυ(μ)βρία), owed its historical importance to the natural harbor and its position on the major commercial roads. It was a colony of Megara founded on a steep 56 m high hill east of the bay, but excavations show that it was a Thracian settlement before it was a Greek colony.
According to Strabo, the city's name is a combination of the name of the mythological founder of the city, Selus, and the Thracian word that Strabo thought was used for polis, ""bria"". This, however, did not mean polis, and had another meaning.
Selymbria is the birthplace of the physician Herodicus, and was an ally of the Athenians in 351 BC. Until the second half of the 2nd century BC, the city could preserve its autonomy, but after its neighbours Byzantium and Perinthos became more powerful,  the city fell under their control during the next centuries. The settlement shrank into a village under the governance  of the Roman Empire. In the early 5th century, the town was officially renamed Eudoxiopolis (Greek: Εὐδοξιόπολις), during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Arcadius (377–408), after his wife Aelia Eudoxia, though this name did not survive.

Medieval
In 805 AD, the Bulgarian Khan Kroum pillaged the town. In the late 9th century, Emperor Michael III constructed a fortress on the top of the hill, the ruins of which still remain, during an era in which the Byzantine Empire suffered attacks by Saracen corsairs and Rus raiders. With the Fourth Crusade, and the fall of Constantinople to the Latin Empire in 1204, the fortress fell in quick succession to the Latin Empire, Bulgarian, back to the Latins and finally was recaptured by the Byzantine successor state of the Empire of Nicaea in 1247, who were finally able to recapture Constantinople and restore the empire in 1261.
In 1346, the Ottomans became an ally of the pretender for the Emperor John VI Cantacuzenus (1292–1383), and helped him against his rival John V Palaeologus (1332–1391). The same year, Sultan Orhan I married Theodora, the daughter of John VI in Selymbria.
In 1399, Selymbria fell ",history
International order,"In international relations, international order refers to patterned or structured relationships between actors on the international level.

Definition
David Lake, Lisa Martin and Thomas Risse define ""order"" as ""patterned or structured relationships among units"".
Michael Barnett defines an international order as ""patterns of relating and acting"" derived from and maintained by rules, institutions, law and norms. International orders have both a material and social component. Legitimacy (the generalized perception that actions are desirable, proper or appropriate) is essential to political orders. George Lawson has defined an international order as ""regularized practices of exchange among discrete political units that recognize each other to be independent."" John Mearsheimer defines an international order ""an organized group of international institutions that help govern the interactions among the member states.""
In After Victory (2001), John Ikenberry defines a political order as ""the governing arrangements among a group of states, including its fundamental rules, principles and institutions.""
The United Nations has been characterized as a proxy for how states broadly perceive the international order.
Jeff Colgan has characterized international order as entailing multiple subsystems. These subsystems can experience drastic change without fundamentally changing the international order.

Liberal international order
The liberal international order describes a set of global, rule-based, structured relationships based on political liberalism, economic liberalism and liberal internationalism since the late 1940s. More specifically, it entails international cooperation through multilateral institutions (like the United Nations, World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund) and is constituted by human equality (freedom, rule of law and human rights), open markets, security cooperation, promotion of liberal democracy, and monetary cooperation. The order was established in the aftermath of World War II, led in large part by the United States.
The nature of the liberal international order, as well as its very existence, has been debated by scholars. The LIO has been credited with expanding free trade, increasing capital mobility, spreading democracy, promoting human rights, and collectively defending the West from the Soviet Union. The LIO facilitated unprecedented cooperation among the states of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Over time, the LIO facilitated the spread of economic liberalism to the rest of the world, as well as helped consolidate democracy in formerly fascist or communist countries.
Origins of the LIO have commonly been identified as the 1940s, usually starting in 1945. John Mearsheimer has dissented with this view, arguing that the LIO only arose after the end of the Cold War, since Liberal International Order is practically possible only during unipolar moment(s), while at the time of the Cold War the World was bipolar.",science
British Arctic Territories,"The British Arctic Territories were a region of British North America, composed of islands to the north of continental North America. They are now known as the Arctic Archipelago.
The British claim to the area was based on the discoveries of Martin Frobisher (1535–1594) in the 16th century. The British government passed control of the islands to Canada in 1880 by means of an imperial order in council, the Adjacent Territories Order, under the royal prerogative. That was made out of fear of the United States' interest in the area as part of the Monroe Doctrine.
Britain had in 1870 transferred most of its remaining land in North America, which was the North-Western Territory and Rupert's Land, to Canada, and it became the Canadian North-West Territories, spelled the Northwest Territories from 1906.
On 1 April 1999, the territory of Nunavut was created from the eastern portion of the Northwest Territories. Most of the islands became part of Nunavut. Islands split between Nunavut and the Northwest Territories include Victoria Island, Melville Island, Mackenzie King Island, and Borden Island.
The islands were never part of Rupert's Land (Hudson Bay drainage basin) or the North-Western Territory (the mainland north and west of Rupert's Land), and both of those trade monopolies were managed by the Hudson's Bay Company. Canada had acquired those regions in 1870 and created the new Province of Manitoba, originally a square 18 times less its current size, as well as the new Northwest Territories, which by 1999 had ceded land to create today's Yukon and Nunavut Territories and the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, and ceded land to existing provinces' expansions into northern Ontario, northern Quebec, all of Manitoba, and the northeastern tip of British Columbia.

Flags of the World has a tradition of posting a new flag for the British Arctic Territory every 1 April. It has led to some persistent misinformation on the web.

The Doctor (painting),"The Doctor is an 1891 painting by Luke Fildes that depicts a Victorian doctor observing the critical stage in a child's illness while the parents gaze on helplessly from the periphery. It has been used to portray the values of the ideal physician and the inadequacies of the medical profession. Different theories exist as to the painting's origin but it is most likely based upon Fildes' own experience of the death of his son. Critics have noted that Fildes omitted common medical equipment of his era in order to focus on the relationship between physician and patient.

Origins
The painting was commissioned by Henry Tate in 1890 as a work of ""social realism"" on a topic of Fildes' choosing to be displayed in the National Gallery of British Art, now known as the Tate Gallery London. Fildes was paid £3,000 for the work, a sum he felt was too small for such a painting and less than he expected for painting portraits. Two Victorian doctors, Dr Thomas Buzzard (neurologist) and Dr Gustavus Murray (obstetrician), have been particularly associated with the painting, as has the genre of the period in which it was painted. Fildes had the particular desire ""to put on record the status of the doctor in our time"".
Different theories exist as to the origins of the painting.

Fildes' personal loss
The most important personal influence was probably the death of Fildes' first child, his one-year-old son, Philip, from typhoid fever on Christmas morning, 1877. Fildes' biographer has described how the boy's death compelled Fildes to paint a picture revolving around the compassionate Dr Murray visiting his dying child. The story was confirmed later by Fildes' second son, who described this as Fildes' ""quickest painted of his 'big' pictures"".

Fildes' experiences
Documentation of Fildes' work with the homeless reveals that a child was once brought into the studio by a labourer, a scenario which prompted the painting The Widower (1876). This painting included many features later seen in The Doctor.
Fildes most likely modelled the characters in the painting on his own family and himself. Observing photographs of himself, Fildes guided his models, who were frequently his friends. His daughter was likely the prototype of the sick child, and a professional model was used for the mother. The child's resting hand and extended arm may have been drawn from Fildes' older son. Despite reports that doctors visited Fildes in the hope of being used as models, the final painting of the doctor resembles Fildes himself.
Paying tribute to his family origins in the fishing industry, Fildes adds a fishing net hanging from the ceiling. His father was a mariner and shipping agent.

On Queen Victoria's orders
The cottage setting has led some to believe that the painting was ordered by Queen Victoria to honour her own physician, Sir James Clark. This alternative account also originates in the story about her physician being sent to Balmoral to care for the sick child of a servant. This account, ",medicine
Land banking,"Land banking is the practice of aggregating parcels of land for future sale or development.
While in many countries land banking may refer to various private real estate investment schemes, in the United States it refers to the establishment of quasi-governmental county or municipal authorities tasked with managing an inventory of surplus land.
In some cases the practice is run as a scam, with land being sold above its market value and its potential for future returns exaggerated.

Municipal land banks in the United States
Definition
Land banks are quasi-governmental entities created by counties or municipalities to effectively manage and repurpose an inventory of underused, abandoned, or foreclosed property. They are often chartered to have powers that enable them to accomplish these goals in ways that existing government agencies can not. While the land bank ""model"" has gained broad support and has been implemented in a number of cities, it is implemented differently so as to best address the needs of the municipality, the state and the local legal context in which it was created.

History
Land banking originated in the 1920s and 1930s as a means of making low-priced land available for housing and ensuring orderly development.  The period of deindustrialization in the United States coupled with increased suburbanization in the middle of the 20th century left many American cities with large amounts of vacant and blighted industrial, residential, and commercial property. Beginning in the early 1970s, municipalities began to seek solutions to manage decline or spur revitalization in once prosperous city neighborhoods. The first land bank was created in St. Louis in 1971.  While additional municipalities continued to adopt them at a trickle it wasn't until the mid 2000s that land banks became viewed as a tested, reliable, and accepted model and experienced widespread implementation – particularly after the success of the Genesee County Land Bank. In 2009, the Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a report embracing land banks as a best practice model for municipalities dealing with the effects of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the ensuing foreclosure crisis.

Investment land banking by country
United Kingdom
Land banking developed in the late 17th Century in the British Isles and was previously the preserve of the landed gentry or real estate developers such as Nicholas Barbon. Many reputable commercial building companies engage successfully in land banking for future building projects. Companies also purchase land sites and easily divide them into smaller plots, then offer these plots for sale to individual investors. This relatively new practice in the UK does not fall under the control of the Financial Conduct Authority. Many people are wary of this form of investment as many plot-based land banking companies have failed or been closed down. There are currently no audited successes recorded for UK plot-based land banking despite",economics

Dirtsurfing,"Dirtsurfing is the sport of riding a Dirtsurfer brand inline board. This new Australian boardsport is correctly known as inline boarding because Dirtsurfer is a trademark protected brand name.
A Dirtsurfer is composed of an aircraft aluminium tube frame, a laminate or composite deck and two 20in or 16in diameter BMX style bicycle wheels. Footstraps are (optionally) attached to the deck to give more control to the rider. The board is unique in that it incorporates a patented steering geometry where the front wheel pivots from a point in front of and below the axle of the wheel, via the 'Swingarm'. The rider's weight automatically centres and straightens the front wheel, creating stability and control.
Another feature of the Dirtsurfer which is not found on other four-wheeled boards is that, much like a bicycle, the stability actually increases with speed.
Inline Boarding was made an official race class by the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) and Gravity Sports International (GSI) in 2005. The 2005 IGSA World Cup Champion inline boarder is Nihat Uysal of Germany.[1] Nihat rides the Silver GP-X (see below)

Models
The first board was designated the GP (general purpose) and was available in black, red and blue colour options.
Initially it was sold without brakes, which were later made standard as an addition to the existing frame, and utilised a retro fit ""calf lever"" operating system.
A Limited Edition model was made of the GP, which offered a silver anodized frame, V rim wheels and a signed certificate and number.
The next board made available was the GP-X, which came with a silver anodized aluminium frame, blue anodized deep V rims, fully integrated calf brake with moulded plastic lever, increased ground clearance, disc brake caliper lugs on the frame, and disc hub on the rear wheel for easy conversion to disc brake use.
Two alternative versions to the GP-X were produced. The first, called the Road Racer, used the same frame as the GP-X in canary yellow powder coat finish, with black V rims and slick tyres.
The other was a UK specific beach racer model, with sealed bearing hubs, Black V rims, disc brake as standard, and beach tread tyres.
In 2003, Dirtsurfer introduced the Flexideck, a newer concept with an epoxy/fibreglass/maple composite deck connecting the front and rear frame to absorb jumps. Made available in powder coated lime green frame with purple anodized V rims, and disc brake as standard, it offered greatly increased ground clearance and a reinforced frame for jumping.
Dirtsurfer has updated their line-up with two new models for 2006: The Flexi Pro Downhill (DH), an updated Flexideck; and the all new Freestyle board (FS), a scaled down Flexideck with 16 inch wheels. Both models feature the new adjustable metal calf brake lever, rear disc brake, and new thermofibre deck. In addition to updating their flexideck boards, dirtsurfer also updated their line of General Purpose models (GP). Both are manufactured from HT steel. T",sports
History of Capri,"The island of Capri is situated in the Gulf of Naples, between the Italian Peninsula and the islands of Procida and Ischia. Made of limestone, its lowest part is at the center, while its sides are high and mostly surrounded by steep precipices, which contain numerous caves. Its topography is dominated by the slopes of the Monte Solaro in the west and Monte San Michele in the east.

Prehistory and Greek period
The first discoveries of prehistoric-age remains occurred more than two thousand years ago during the Roman Imperial era, when excavations for Imperial buildings on the island unearthed remains of animals that had disappeared tens of thousands before, as well as traces of Stone-Age occupants. The story was documented by the historian Suetonius (75–140) who described the interest shown by the emperor Augustus in preserving these remains, creating the first museum of paleontology and paleoanthropology in his villa's garden.
The earliest mythical inhabitants were the Teleboi from Acarnania under their king Telon. Neolithic remains were found in 1882 in the Grotta delle Felci, a cave on the south coast. In historical times the island was occupied by Greeks who from the 8th century BC onward first settled on the island of Ischia and the mainland, at Cumae, and later came to Capri. The historian Strabo wrote that ""in ancient times there were two towns in Capri, which were later reduced to one"".
One of those two towns was the precursor to today's Capri town. This is confirmed by the remains of fortification walls, built with large limestone boulders at the bottom and square blocks at the top, visible from the terrace of the funicular railway, and a building at the foot of Castiglione, and these, together with other buildings now destroyed, complete the old town (5th to 4th century BC).
Regarding the second city, many hypotheses have been advanced, but the most reliable is that even then it was Anacapri, based on the existence of the Phoenician Steps that connect to the port (despite its name, the steps were not built by the Phoenicians, but by Greek colonists).
Since its first settlement, the natural shape of the island led to the creation of two communities, one in the east with hills sloping down to the sea, and one to the west on a large plateau, the steep slopes of Monte Solaro and with no access to the sea.
Capri subsequently fell into the hands of Neapolis (the former Greek colony called Naples today) and remained so until the time of Augustus, who took it in exchange for Aenaria (Ischia) and often resided there.

Roman period
Tiberius spent the last ten years of his life at Capri and built twelve villas there, the best known being the Villa Jovis whose impressive remains are still visible. All these villas can be identified with more or less certainty the best-preserved being on Anacapri consisting of a large number of vaulted substructures and the foundations perhaps of a Pharos (lighthouse). These include the Palazzo a Mare, villa di Grado",history
Conservation science (cultural property),"With respect to cultural property, conservation science is the interdisciplinary study of the conservation of art, architecture, technical art history and other cultural works through the use of scientific inquiry. General areas of research include the technology and structure of artistic and historic works. In other words, the materials and techniques from which cultural, artistic and historic objects are made. 
There are three broad categories of conservation science with respect to cultural heritage: understanding the materials and techniques used by artists, study of the causes of deterioration, and improving techniques and materials for examination and treatment. Conservation science includes aspects of materials science, chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering, as well as art history and anthropology. Institutions such as the Getty Conservation Institute specialize in publishing and disseminating information relating to both tools used for and outcomes of conservation science research, as well as recent discoveries in the field.

Introduction
Prior to thorough scientific analysis, a detailed visual assessment of the object, heritage site, or artwork is necessary in addition to gathering all relevant historic and current documentation. Diagnosing the current state in a non-invasive way allows both conservators and conservation scientists to determine exactly what further analysis would be required and whether the subject of the study will be able to withstand more rigorous examination. Additionally, since the goal of conservation-restoration is to only do the minimum required for preservation, this initial assessment falls in line with the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) Code of Ethics which outlines best practice for conservators and scientists alike.
Along with assessing the current state and potential risk of future deterioration of artworks and objects, scientific study may be necessary to determine if there is risk to the conservators themselves. For example, some pigments used in paintings contain highly toxic elements such as arsenic or lead and could be hazardous to those working with them. Alternatively, previous restoration efforts may have involved chemicals that are now known to have dangerous side effects with prolonged exposure. In these cases, conservation science may reveal the nature of these hazards as well as present solutions for how to prevent current and future exposure.

Material properties
Research into the chemical and physical properties intrinsic to the materials used to create cultural heritage objects is a large part of the study of conservation science. Materials science, in conjunction with the broader field of restoration and preservation, has resulted in what is now recognized as modern conservation. Using analytical techniques and tools, conservation scientists are able to determine what makes up a particular object or artwork. In turn, this knowledge informs how deterioration is likely to occ",science
Barbaria (region),"Barbaria was the name used by the ancient Greeks for coastal northeast Africa. The corresponding Arabic term, bilad al-Barbar (land of the Barbar), was used in the Middle Ages. The name of Barbaria is preserved today in the name of the Somali city of Berbera, the city known to the Greeks as Malao.

Greek sources
According to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a 1st-century travelogue written by a Greek merchant based in Alexandria, Barbaria extended from the border of Egypt just south of Berenice Troglodytica to just north of Ptolemais Theron. From there to the Bab-el-Mandeb was the kingdom ruled by Zoskales (possibly Aksum), after which the ""rest of Barbaria"" extended to Opone. This second Barbaria was the location of the so-called ""far-side"" ports.
In the Geography of Ptolemy (2nd century), Barbaria is said to extend even further, as far south as Zanzibar, although the land south of Opone is called Azania in the Periplus. Ptolemy describes the city of Rhapta as the ""metropolis of Barbaria"". Barbaria is also mentioned in Marcian of Heraclea. Later sources (Cosmas Indicopleustes and Stephanus of Byzantium) place it on the African side of the Arabian Sea.
The first contact of the Greeks with Barbaria came in the 3rd century BC, when the Ptolemies set up bases for elephant hunting. These bases remained in use as ports for the export of myrrh and frankincense throughout antiquity. There were many smaller ports that exported tortoiseshell and ivory. In the Periplus, Barbaria is said to lack a central government and is ruled by local chiefs.  In the Periplus, the inhabitants of the first Barbaria, or the Barbarike chora (Barbarian region), include the eponymous Barbaroi (Barbarians, Berbers), but also Ichthyophagoi (fish eaters), Agriophagoi (wild beast eaters) and Moschophagoi (shoot eaters). These are probably the same people as the Trogodytes of other ancient geographers. The Moschophagoi may correspond to the Rhizophagoi (root eaters) and Spermatophagoi (seed eaters) of other geographers.

Arabic sources
Arabic sources refer to the coast as the Baḥr Berberā or al-Khalīj al-Berberī and its inhabitants as the Berbera or Berābir. They are the Somalis, distinguished from the Habash to their north and the Zanj to their south. From Arabic, this terminology for northeast Africa entered Hebrew (Barbara), Persian (Barbaristan) and even Chinese (Pi-pa-li). Most of these usages are associated with Somalia. The Chinese term, although probably derived from Berbera, refers to the coast and hinterland and not just the port.

Chinese sources
In the historical work known as the Book of Tang, an extensive chronicle compiled during the Tang dynasty, a region of Barbaria is described in great detail. This area, specifically the Berbera coast, is referred to as Pi-p'a-lo (皮波羅). The text provides valuable insights into the geography, culture, economy, and unique fauna of this part of the world. 

Below is an excerpt from the Book of Tang, offering a glimpse into life ",history
Social science,"Social science (often rendered in the plural as the social sciences) is one of the branches of science, devoted to the study of societies and the relationships among members within those societies. The term was formerly used to refer to the field of sociology, the original ""science of society"", established in the 18th century. In addition to sociology, it now encompasses a wide array of academic disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, history, linguistics, management, communication studies, psychology, culturology, and political science.
Positivist social scientists use methods resembling those used in the natural sciences as tools for understanding societies, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist or speculative social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research). The term social research has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share similar goals and methods.

History
The history of the social sciences began in the Age of Enlightenment after 1651, which saw a revolution within natural philosophy, changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was scientific. Social sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and were influenced by the Age of Revolutions, such as the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution. The social sciences developed from the sciences (experimental and applied), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the social improvement of a group of interacting entities.
The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of Diderot, with articles from Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The term ""social science"" was coined in French by Mirabeau in 1767, before becoming a distinct conceptual field in the nineteenth century. Social science was influenced by positivism, focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; metaphysical speculation was avoided. Auguste Comte used the term science sociale to describe the field, taken from the ideas of Charles Fourier; Comte also referred to the field as social physics.
Following this period, five paths of development sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte in other fields. One route that was taken was the rise of social research. Large statistical surveys were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe. Another route undertaken was initiated by Émile Durkheim, studying ""social facts"", and Vilfredo Pareto, opening metatheo",science
Nanocovax,"Nanocovax is a Vietnamese COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC. It is a subunit vaccine (SARS‑CoV‑2 recombinant spike protein with aluminum adjuvant).

Medical uses
The vaccine requires two doses, the second one being administered 28 days after the first shot. It is given by intramuscular injection.

Clinical trials
The Vietnamese health ministry has assessed the Nanocovax vaccine produced by Nanogen as the most promising, having been successfully produced on a laboratory scale and provoked immunogenicity during animal testing.

Preclinical and phase I
Preclinical studies of Nanocovax were conducted on hamsters and non-human primates, including a challenge test, exposing hamsters to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. On 17 December 2020, Nanogen commenced human trials of Nanocovax vaccine.
The clinical trial Phase 1 (open-label, dose-escalation) recruited 60 healthy Vietnamese adult volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and initial assessment of immunogenicity of the vaccine intramuscularly in the participants. The first-stage trials of Nanocovax showed the vaccine was safe and vaccinated volunteers had antibodies against the Alpha variant.

Phase II
On 26 February 2021, the pharmaceutical company began second phase trials in two places, Hanoi and southern province of Long An. The clinical trial Phase 2 (randomization, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled) enrolled 560 healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and determined the optimal dose of the vaccine intramuscularly in participants,  with 160 volunteers receiving each dose of the vaccine and 80 receiving the placebo. From 25 March to 6 April, volunteers receiving the first jabs in phase II between 26 February and 10 March were given the second shots of the Nanocovax vaccine. Some volunteers experienced side effects around the injection site, yet did not require medical intervention.
Results of the trial issued in April 2021 show the homegrown COVID-19 vaccine is safe. According to the trial results, people injected with 25mcg dose got the highest index with more than 90% at 14 days after the second shot and 42 days since the first doses. The research team had submitted a report to the Research Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health and proposed a plan for the third phase of human trials. Dose strength of 25 mcg is selected for phase 3 to evaluate the vaccine efficacy.

Safety outcome
Local adverse effects including pain were reported in 32.6% and 32.1% of the subjects after the first and the second doses, respectively. Systemic effects including fatigue and headache were found in about 16.9% and 13.3% of participants after each injection, respectively. Fever was rare but was reported in 3.8% of participants after both doses.
SAEs were rare; however, severe back pain was reported in three patients, whereas one patient exhibited serious sepsis, and another patient experienced a severe sore throat. Milder adverse effects s",medicine
Jet Age,"The Jet Age is a period in the history of aviation defined by the advent of aircraft powered by jet turbine engines and the social and cultural changes fostered by commercial jet travel.
Jet airliners were able to fly higher, faster, and farther than older piston‑powered propliners, making transcontinental and intercontinental travel considerably faster and easier. Aircraft leaving North America and crossing the Atlantic Ocean (and later, the Pacific Ocean) could now fly to their destinations non-stop, making much of the world accessible within a single day's travel for the first time. Large jetliners could carry more passengers than piston-powered airliners, which caused air fares to decline and opened international travel to a broader range of socioeconomic groups.
In addition to pure jet engines, turbine-driven propeller engines  delivered a smoother ride and better fuel efficiency.  One exception to jet-powered domination by large airliners was the contra-rotating propellers turboprop design that powered the Tu-114 (first flight 1957). This airliner was able to match or even exceed the speed, capacity and range of contemporary jets, but such powerplants were only used in large airframes for military planes after 1976.
The introduction of the Concorde supersonic transport (SST) airliner to regular service in 1976 was expected to further revolutionize air travel by shortening travel times dramatically, but the aircraft never found commercial success. After two and a half decades of service, Concorde flights were discontinued in 2003 after a fatal crash near Paris in July 2000 and other factors. This was the only loss of an SST in civilian service. Only one other SST design was used in a civilian capacity, the Soviet era Tu-144, but it was soon withdrawn due to high maintenance and other issues. McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and Boeing were three U.S. manufacturers that had originally planned to develop various SST designs since the 1960s, but these projects were eventually abandoned for various developmental, cost, and other practical reasons.

Origins
The term ""Jet Age"" was coined in the late 1940s. At the time, the only jet-powered aircraft in production were military types, most of which were fighters. The expression reflects the recognition that the jet engine had effected, or would soon, a profound change in aeronautics and aviation.
One view is that the jet age began with the invention of the jet engine in the 1930s and 1940s. In the history of military aviation it began in 1944 with the introduction into service of the Arado Ar 234 reconnaissance bomber and the Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter during World War II. In commercial aviation, the jet age was introduced to Britain in 1952 with the first scheduled flight of the de Havilland Comet airliner and to America later in the decade with the first American-built jet airliners.

The British de Havilland Comet was the first jet airliner to fly (1949), the first in service (1952), ",history
Image analysis,"Image analysis or imagery analysis is the extraction of meaningful information from images; mainly from digital images by means of digital image processing techniques. Image analysis tasks can be as simple as reading bar coded tags or as sophisticated as identifying a person from their face.
Computers are indispensable for the analysis of large amounts of data, for tasks that require complex computation, or for the extraction of quantitative information.  On the other hand, the human visual cortex is an excellent image analysis apparatus, especially for extracting higher-level information, and for many applications — including medicine, security, and remote sensing — human analysts still cannot be replaced by computers.  For this reason, many important image analysis tools such as edge detectors and neural networks are inspired by human visual perception models.

Digital
Digital Image Analysis or Computer Image Analysis is when a computer or electrical device automatically studies an image to obtain useful information from it. Note that the device is often a computer but may also be an electrical circuit, a digital camera or a mobile phone. 
It involves the fields of computer or machine vision, and medical imaging, and makes heavy use of pattern recognition, digital geometry, and signal processing.  This field of computer science developed in the 1950s at academic institutions such as the MIT A.I. Lab, originally as a branch of artificial intelligence and robotics.
It is the quantitative or qualitative characterization of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) digital images. 2D images are, for example, to be analyzed in computer vision, and 3D images in medical imaging. The field was established in the 1950s—1970s, for example with pioneering contributions by Azriel Rosenfeld, Herbert Freeman, Jack E. Bresenham, or King-Sun Fu.

Techniques
There are many different techniques used in automatically analysing images. Each technique may be useful for a small range of tasks, however there still aren't any known methods of image analysis that are generic enough for wide ranges of tasks, compared to the abilities of a human's image analysing capabilities. Examples of image analysis techniques in different fields include:

2D and 3D object recognition,
image segmentation,
motion detection e.g. Single particle tracking,
video tracking,
optical flow,

Bioeconomics (fisheries),"Environmental economics is a sub-field of economics concerned with environmental issues. It has become a widely studied subject due to growing environmental concerns in the twenty-first century. Environmental economics ""undertakes theoretical or empirical studies of the economic effects of national or local environmental policies around the world. ... Particular issues include the costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies to deal with air pollution, water quality, toxic substances, solid waste, and global warming.""
Environmental economics is distinguished from ecological economics in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving natural capital. One survey of German economists found that ecological and environmental economics are different schools of economic thought, with ecological economists emphasizing ""strong"" sustainability and rejecting the proposition that human-made (""physical"") capital can substitute for natural capital.

History
The modern field of environmental economics has been traced to the 1960s with significant contribution from Post-Keynesian economist Paul Davidson, who had just completed a management position with the Continental Oil Company.

Topics and concepts
Market failure
Central to environmental economics is the concept of market failure. Market failure means that markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. As stated by Hanley, Shogren, and White (2007): ""A market failure occurs when the market does not allocate scarce resources to generate the greatest social welfare. A wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment. Such a wedge implies wastefulness or economic inefficiency; resources can be reallocated to make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off."" This results in a inefficient market that needs to be corrected through avenues such as government intervention. Common forms of market failure include externalities, non-excludability and non-rivalry.

Externality
An externality exists when a person makes a choice that affects other people in a way that is not accounted for in the market price. An externality can be positive or negative but is usually associated with negative externalities in environmental economics. For instance, water seepage in residential buildings occurring in upper floors affect the lower floors. Another example concerns how the sale of Amazon timber disregards the amount of carbon dioxide released in the cutting. Or a firm emitting pollution will typically not take into account the costs that its pollution imposes on others. As a result, pollution may occur in excess of the 'socially efficient' level, which is the level that would exist if the market was required to account for the pollution. A classic definition influenced by Kenneth Arrow and James Meade is provided by Heller and Starrett (1",economics
Early Assyrian period,"The Early Assyrian period was the earliest stage of Assyrian history, preceding the Old Assyrian period and covering the history of the city of Assur, and its people and culture, prior to the foundation of Assyria as an independent city-state under Puzur-Ashur I c. 2025 BC. Very little material and textual evidence survives from this period. The earliest archaeological evidence at Assur dates to the Early Dynastic Period, c. 2600 BC, but the city may have been founded even earlier since the area had been inhabited for thousands of years prior and other nearby cities, such as Nineveh, are significantly older.
The archaeological evidence suggests that Assur was originally inhabited by Hurrians and was the site of a fertility cult devoted to the goddess Ishtar. The name ""Assur"" is not historically attested prior to the age of the Akkadian Empire in the 24th century BC; it is possible that the city was originally named Baltil, used in later times to refer to its oldest portion. At some point before the rise of the Akkadian Empire, the Semitic-speaking ancestors of the later Assyrians settled in Assur and the surrounding area, either displacing or assimilating the original population. Founded in a both holy and strategic location, the city itself was gradually deified during the Early Assyrian period and eventually became personified as the god Ashur, firmly established as the Assyrian national deity by the time of Puzur-Ashur I.
There is no evidence that Assur was independent at any point in the Early Assyrian period. Throughout the centuries prior to Puzur-Ashur I, it is instead evident that the city was dominated by a sequence of powerful states and empires from southern Mesopotamia. In the Early Dynastic Period, Assur experienced considerable Sumerian influence, and for a time fell under the hegemony of the Sumerian city of Kish. In the 24th to 22nd centuries BC, the city was part of the Akkadian Empire as an administrative outpost in northern Mesopotamia, a time later Assyrian kings saw as a golden age. In the final geopolitical stage preceding Assur's independence, the city became a peripheral city within the Sumerian empire of the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112–2004 BC).

History
Origins of Assur
Agricultural villages in the region that would later become Assyria are known to have existed by the time of the Hassuna culture, c. 6300–5800 BC. The city of Assur was probably founded at some point in the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2900–2350 BC), or perhaps earlier, though there is no evidence of the city being an independent state prior to the time of Puzur-Ashur I, who ruled c. 2025 BC. The earliest archaeological evidence known from Assur predates the Akkadian Empire by only a few centuries, being from c. 2600 BC or c. 2500 BC. At this time, the surrounding region was already relatively urbanized, a development that might perhaps have resulted from being influenced by the heavily urbanized southern Mesopotamia. Archaeological evidence from the Early ",history
History of Maharashtra,"Maharashtra is a state in the western region of India. It is India's second-most populous state and third-largest state by area. The region that comprises the state has a long history dating back to approximately 1300–700 BCE, although the present-day state was not established until 1960 CE.
Prior to Indian independence, notable dynasties and entities that ruled the region included, in chronological order, the Maurya Empire, Western Satraps, Satavahana dynasty, Chalukya Empire, Rashtrakuta dynasty, Western Chalukya Empire, Seuna Yadava dynasty, Bahamani Sultanate, Deccan sultanates, Mughal Empire, Maratha Empire, and British Raj. Ruins, monuments, tombs, forts, and places of worship left by these rulers are dotted around the state.
At the time of the Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, the region—along with the British-ruled areas of Bombay Presidency, and Central Provinces and Berar—included many British vassal states. Among these, the erstwhile Hyderabad State was the largest, and extended over many modern Indian states. Other states grouped under the Deccan States Agency included Kolhapur, Miraj, Sangli, Aundh, Bhor, and Sawantwadi. Following independence from the British in 1947 and a campaign to create a Marathi-speaking state in the 1950s, the state of Maharashtra was formed in 1960.
From the 4th century BCE until 875, Maharashtri Prakrit and its dialects were the dominant languages of the region. The Marathi language, which evolved from Maharashtri Prakrit, has been the common language since the 9th century. The oldest stone inscriptions in the Marathi language date to around 975 CE, and can be seen at the foot of the Lord Bahubali statue in the Jain temple at Shravanabelgola in modern-day Karnataka.

Early history
Chalcolithic sites belonging to the Jorwe culture (ca. 1300–700 BCE) have been discovered throughout the state. The largest settlement discovered of the culture is at Daimabad, a Late Harappan site, which had a mud fortification during this period, as well as an elliptical temple with fire pits. Some settlements show evidence of planning in the layout of rectangular houses and streets or lanes. In the Late Harappan period there was a large migration of people from Gujarat to northern Maharashtra.
Maharashtra was historically the name of a region which consisted of Aparanta, Vidarbha, Mulak, Assaka (Asmaka), and Kuntala. In ancient times, tribal communities of Bhil people inhabited this area, also known as Dandakaranya. Linguists and archeologists believe it is likely that Maharashtra was inhabited by Dravidian speakers during the middle Rigvedic period, as suggested by Dravidian names of places in Maharashtra.
Maharashtra region later became part of the Maurya Empire, with edicts of emperor Ashoka having been found in the region. Buddhism flourished during this period. Trade in Maharashtra flourished through international trade with the Greeks and later with the Roman Empire. Traders were the primary patrons ",history
Criticism of Qing dynasty's economic performance,"During the Manchu–led Qing dynasty, the economy was significantly developed and markets continued to expand especially in the High Qing era, and imperial China experienced a second commercial revolution in the economic history of China from the mid-16th century to the end of the 18th century. But akin to the other major non-European powers around the world at that time like the Islamic gunpowder empires and Tokugawa Japan, such an economy development did not keep pace with the economies of European countries in the Industrial Revolution occurring by the early 19th century, which resulted in a dramatic change described by the 19th-century Qing official Li Hongzhang (who promoted the Self-Strengthening Movement) as ""the biggest change in more than three thousand years"" (三千年未有之大變局).
Critics of the Qing, some of whom may be motivated by Chinese nationalism and anti-Qing sentiment, argue that the specific actions and policies of the Qing dynasty held the nation-state of China back during its rule, when the Industrial Revolution which occurred in Europe by the 19th century led to a Great Divergence in which China lost its early modern economic and industrial lead over the West which it had previously held for more than a millennium. According to the critics, the advances in science and technology and economic development in the preceding Song and Ming dynasties moved China toward a modern age, but the restrictions placed on commerce and industry and the persecution of non-orthodox thought after the transition from Ming to Qing in the 17th century caused China to gradually stagnate and fall behind the West and led to the century of humiliation.
Scholars outside China generally disagree with such an argument, and many scholars instead emphasize the positive effects of the Qing dynasty's order on the Chinese economy. At the same time, American scholar Kenneth Pomeranz rejects the assertion that ""certain Asian societies were headed toward an industrial breakthrough until Manchu or British invaders crushed the 'sprouts of capitalism'"", although he suggests that the Qing revitalization of the state may have impeded the growth of ""fashion"". In conclusion, he sees the Great Divergence as resulting primarily from what happened in the West, rather than what failed to happen in the Qing Empire. He adds that the difference in the West that facilitated the Industrial Revolution was not accumulated past ""progress"" or a more inventive mindset but rather a number of historically particular ""contingencies"", above all Europe's colonial exploitation of the New World through the use of slave labor from Africa.

Background
Different dates are offered for the beginning or end of ascendency and whether it was in economic, technological, or political terms. It has been argued that either the Ming or the Qing was the time when China fell behind, and either because of stagnation or because Europe or the West pulled ahead. The economic historian Angus Maddison calculates that in",history
Agricultural cooperative,"An agricultural cooperative, also known as a farmers' co-op, is a producer cooperative in which farmers pool their resources in certain areas of activities.
A broad typology of agricultural cooperatives distinguishes between agricultural service cooperatives, which provide various services to their individually-farming members, and agricultural production cooperatives in which production resources (land, machinery) are pooled and members farm jointly. 
Agricultural production cooperatives are relatively rare in the world. They include collective farms in former socialist countries, the kibbutzim in Israel, collectively-governed community shared agriculture, Longo Maï co-operatives in Costa Rica, France, and some other countries, CPAs in Cuba, and Nicaraguan production cooperatives. 
The default meaning of ""agricultural cooperative"" in English is usually an agricultural service cooperative, the numerically dominant form in the world. There are two primary types of agricultural service cooperatives: supply cooperatives and marketing cooperatives. Supply cooperatives supply their members with inputs for agricultural production, including seeds, fertilizers, fuel, and machinery services. Marketing cooperatives are established by farmers to undertake transportation, packaging, pricing, distribution, sales and promotion of farm products (both crop and livestock). Farmers also widely rely on credit cooperatives as a source of financing for both working capital and investments.
Notable examples of agricultural cooperatives include  Dairy Farmers Of America, the largest dairy company in the US, Amul, the largest food product marketing organization in India and Zen-Noah, a federation of agricultural cooperatives that handles 70% of the sales of chemical fertilizers in Japan.

Purpose
Cooperatives as a form of business organization are distinct from the more common investor-owned firms (IOFs). Both are organized as corporations, but IOFs pursue profit maximization objectives, whereas cooperatives strive to maximize the benefits they generate for their members (which usually involves zero-profit operation). Agricultural cooperatives are therefore created in situations where farmers cannot obtain essential services from IOFs (because the provision of these services is judged to be unprofitable by the IOFs), or when IOFs provide the services at disadvantageous terms to the farmers (i.e., the services are available, but the profit-motivated prices are too high for the farmers). The former situations are characterized in economic theory as market failure or missing services motive. The latter drive the creation of cooperatives as a competitive yardstick or as a means of allowing farmers to build countervailing market power to oppose the IOFs. The concept of competitive yardstick implies that farmers, faced with an unsatisfactory performance by IOFs, may form a cooperative firm whose purpose is to force the IOFs, through competition, to improve their service to f",economics
Regulatory science,"Regulatory science is the scientific and technical foundations upon which regulations are based in various industries – particularly those involving health or safety. Regulatory bodies employing such principles in the United States include, for example, the FDA for food and medical products, the EPA for the environment, and the OSHA for work safety.
""Regulatory science"" is contrasted with regulatory affairs and regulatory law, which refer to the administrative or legal aspects of regulation, in that the former is focused on the regulations' scientific underpinnings and concerns – rather than the regulations' promulgation, implementation, compliance, or enforcement.

History
Probably the first investigator who recognized the nature of regulatory science was Alvin Weinberg, who described the scientific process used to evaluate effects of ionizing radiation as trans science. The origin of the term regulatory science is unknown. It was probably coined sometimes in the late 1970s in an undated memorandum prepared by A. Alan Moghissi, who was describing scientific issues that the newly formed US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was facing . During that period the EPA was forced to meet legally mandated deadlines to make decisions that would require reliance upon science that was not meeting conventional scientific requirements. At that time the prevailing view was that there was no need to establish a new scientific discipline because ""science is science"" regardless of its application. In the spring of 1985, Moghissi established the Institute for Regulatory Science in the commonwealth of Virginia as a nonprofit organization with the objective to perform scientific studies ""at the interface between science and the regulatory system"". Moghissi et al. have provided an extensive description of history of regulatory science including various perception of regulatory science leading to the acceptance of regulatory science by the FDA.

Definition
Two federal regulatory agencies have provided definitions for regulatory science. According to Food and Drug Administration: “Regulatory Science is the science of developing new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of all FDA-regulated products”. According to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): “Regulatory science means scientific information including assessments, models, criteria documents, and regulatory impact analyses that provide the basis for significant regulatory decisions”.
Moghissi et al. have described the history of regulatory science and define it as:
“Regulatory science consists of an applied version of various scientific disciplines used in the regulatory process”. Based on their definition the generalized FDA definition is: Regulatory science is the science of developing new tools, standards, and approaches derived from various scientific disciplines to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of all FDA-regulated products.

History of scholarship,"The history of scholarship is the historical study of fields of study which are not covered by the English term ""science"" (cf., history of science), but are covered by, for example, the German term ""Wissenschaft"" (i.e., all kinds of academic studies). Examples are the history of classical studies, the history of the study of religions, of philosophy, of Biblical studies, of historiography, of the study of music, the study of arts, the study of literature etc. It is a field which has recently undergone a complete renewal and is now a major branch of research. As of 2016, the journal History of Humanities is dedicated to writing the history of scholarship in the humanities as different from (although interconnected with) the sciences.

Philosophers, scholars, polymaths, and scientists
The word scientist was coined by the English philosopher and historian of science William Whewell in 1833. Until then there was no differentiation between the history of science, the history of philosophy and the history of scholarship.
Before 1700 the fields of scholarship were not of a size that made academic specialisation necessary. Academic disciplines as we know them today did not exist. In general scholars were both scientists and scholars in what today is termed Arts and Humanities.

Medicine,"Medicine is the science and practice of caring for patients, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.
Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, and for most of this time it was an art (an area of creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). For example, while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.
Prescientific forms of medicine, now known as traditional medicine or folk medicine, remain commonly used in the absence of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. Alternative treatments outside of scientific medicine with ethical, safety and efficacy concerns are termed quackery.

Etymology
Medicine (UK:  , US:  ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word ""medicine"" is derived from Latin medicus, meaning ""a physician"". The word ""physic"" itself, from which ""physician"" derives, was the old word for what is now called a medicine, and also the field of medicine.

Clinical practice
Medical availability and clinical practice vary across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the Western world, while in developing countries such as parts of Africa or Asia, the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners.
In the developed world, evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice; for example, a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.
In modern clinical practice, physicians and physician assistants personally assess patients to diagnose, prognose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins with ",medicine
Sanda (sport),"Sanda (Chinese: 散打; pinyin: Sǎndǎ), formerly Sanshou (Chinese: 散手; pinyin: Sǎnshǒu), is the official Chinese kickboxing full-contact combat sport. In Chinese Language, ""Sanda"" originally referred to independent and separate training and combat techniques in contrast to ""Taolu"" (pre-arranged forms or routines). 
Sanda is a fighting system which was originally developed by the Chinese military based upon the study and practices of traditional Chinese martial arts and modern combat fighting techniques; it combines boxing and full-contact kickboxing, which includes close range and rapid successive punches and kicks, with wrestling, takedowns, throws, sweeps, kick catches, and in some competitions, even elbow and knee strikes.
As part of the development of sport wushu by the Chinese government, a standard curriculum for Sanda was developed. It is to this standard curriculum that the term Wushu Sanda is usually applied. Sanda may also involve techniques from any other fighting style depending on the teacher's mode of instruction.

History
Sanda's competitive history is rooted in barehanded elevated arena or Lei Tai fights in which no rules were observed. However, Sanda as a competitive event developed in the military as these bouts were commonly held between the soldiers to test and practice barehanded martial skills, ability and techniques. Rules were developed and the use of protective gloves etc. was adopted. It was originally used by the Kuomintang at the first modern military academy in Whampoa in the 1920s. In 1928, the Central Kuoshu Academy was formed, and they sponsored a full-contact tournament. When the Kuomintang government moved to Taiwan, they began holding a full-contact tournament in the 1950s, calling it lei tai. The sport was also adopted as a method by the People's Liberation Army of China, and subseqently civilian competitions developed. Sanda's curriculum as a competitive sport was developed with reference to traditional Chinese martial arts, but since the goal in sports is ""winning the match"", techniques were adapted to make the activity scoring-oriented. This general Wushu Sanda curriculum varies in its different forms, as the Chinese government developed a version for civilians for self-defense and as a sport.

Curriculum
The generalized modern curriculum practiced in modern wushu schools is composed of different traditional martial arts fighting styles from China and Western Boxing, but mainly based on scientific efficiency. Wushu Sanda is composed of Chinese martial arts applications including most aspects of combat including striking and grappling, however when Wushu Sanda was developed as a sport, restrictions were made for safety reasons as well as to promote it as a non-violent sport. Examples of such restrictions included no blows delivered to the back of the head, throat, spine or groin and the discontinuation of the combat when any of the fighters fall to the ground. However many schools, whether traditional or modern, ",sports

Sports science,"Sports science is a discipline that studies how the healthy human body works during exercise, and how sports and physical activity promote health and performance from cellular to whole body perspectives. The study of sports science traditionally incorporates areas of physiology (exercise physiology), psychology (sport psychology), anatomy, biomechanics (sports biomechanics), biochemistry, and kinesiology. 

Sport scientists and performance consultants are growing in demand and employment numbers, with the ever-increasing focus within the sporting world on achieving the best results possible. Through the scientific study of sports, researchers have developed a greater understanding of how the human body reacts to exercise, training, different environments, and many other stimuli.

Origins of exercise physiology
Sports science can trace its origins back to Ancient Greece. The noted ancient Greek physician Galen (131–201) wrote 87 detailed essays about improving health (proper nutrition), aerobic fitness, and strengthening muscles.

New ideas upon the working and functioning of the human body emerged during the Renaissance as anatomists and physicians challenged the previously known theories. These spread with the implementation of the printed word, the result of Gutenberg's printing press in the 15th century. Allied with this was a large increase in academia in general, universities were forming all around the world. Importantly, these new scholars went beyond the simplistic notions of the early Greek physicians, and shed light upon the complexities of the circulatory, and digestive systems. Furthermore, by the middle of the 19th century, early medical schools (such as the Harvard Medical School, formed 1782) began appearing in the United States, whose graduates went on to assume positions of importance in academia and allied medical research.
Medical journal publications increased significantly in number during this period. In 1898, three articles on physical activity appeared in the first volume of the  American Journal of Physiology. Other articles and reviews subsequently appeared in prestigious journals. The German applied physiology publication, Internationale Zeitschrift fur Physiologie einschliesslich Arbeitphysiologie  (1929–1940; now known as the European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology), became a significant journal in the field of research.
A number of key figures have made significant contributions to the study of sports science: 

Austin Flint, Jr., (1836–1915) One of the first American pioneer physicians, studied physiological responses to exercise in his influential medical textbooks.
Edward Hitchcock, Jr., (1828–1911) Amherst College Professor of Hygiene and Physical Education, devoted his academic career to the scientific study of physical exercise, training, and the body. Coauthored 1860 text on exercise physiology.

Press freedom
While the constitution provides for freedom of the press, the ability of the press to criticize the regime is severely limited. In particular the absence of a communications code protecting press freedoms allows authorities to prosecute journalists under libel law and the criminal code whenever the content of their reporting offends the facto regime.
In November 2012 the de facto minister of communications stated that assertions harming the ""general interest"" were banned from public media. Gendarmes interrogated the editor-in-chief of Le Courrier de Madagascar for several hours in April 2012 after he ran a story entitled, ""Governance--the Brothel Takes Hold at High Levels."" Investigative journalists are often targets of threats and harassment from authorities. In May 2012 police stopped a journalist from La Verite, a pro-regime newspaper, on his way to cover an event in Antananarivo. Police reportedly beat him and broke his arm.

History of Bengal,"The history of Bengal is intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent and the surrounding regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia. It includes modern-day Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam's Karimganj district, located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, at the apex of the Bay of Bengal and dominated by the fertile Ganges delta. The region was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans as Gangaridai, a powerful kingdom whose war elephant forces led the withdrawal of Alexander the Great from India. Some historians have identified Gangaridai with other parts of India. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers act as a geographic marker of the region, but also connects the region to the broader Indian subcontinent. Bengal, at times, has played an important role in the history of the Indian subcontinent.
The area's early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas (kingdoms), while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. A thalassocracy and an entrepôt of the historic Silk Road, ancient Bengal had strong trade links with Persia, Arabia and the Mediterranean that focused on its lucrative cotton muslin textiles. The region was a part of several ancient pan-Indian empires, including the Mauryans and Guptas. It was also a bastion of regional kingdoms. The citadel of Gauda served as capital of the Gauda Kingdom, the Buddhist Pala Empire (eighth to 11th century), the Hindu Sena Empire (11th–12th century) and the Hindu Deva Empire (12th-13th century). This era saw the development of Bengali language, script, literature, music, art and architecture.
The Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent absorbed Bengal into the medieval Islamic and Persianate worlds. Between the 1204 and 1352, Bengal was a province of the Delhi Sultanate. This era saw the introduction of the taka as monetary currency, which has endured into the modern era. An independent Bengal Sultanate was formed in 1346 and ruled the region for two centuries, during which Islam was the state religion. The ruling elite also turned Bengal into the easternmost haven of Indo-Persian culture. The Sultans exerted influence in the Arakan region of Southeast Asia, where Buddhist kings copied the sultanate's governance, currency and fashion. A relationship with Ming China flourished under the sultanate.
The Bengal Sultanate was notable for its Hindu aristocracy, including the rise of Raja Ganesha and his son Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah as usurpers. Hindus served in the royal administration as prime ministers and poets. Under the patronage of Sultans like Alauddin Hussain Shah, Bengali literature began replacing the strong influence of Sanskrit in the region. Hindu principalities included the Kingdom of Mallabhum, Kingdom of Bhurshut and Kingdom of Tripura; and the realm of powerful Hindu Rajas such as Prat",history
Dorsal pancreatic agenesis,"Dorsal pancreatic agenesis is a congenital anomaly characterised by the absence of the duct of Santorini, tail and body of the pancreas. It is regarded as asymptomatic and the most common clinical manifestation is non-specific abdominal pain. While the cause is unclear, its mechanism is thought to be impaired dorsal buds or mutation of genes that regulate organogenesis during embryogenesis.
Early diagnostic methods are laparotomy and autopsy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and computed tomography scan (CT scan) are combined for diagnosis of this agenesis in recent years. No specific medications are needed for relieving symptoms, but pancreatic enzymes capsule and insulin are prescribed.
Scholars have studied several transcription factors and proteins that can manipulate pancreatic growth and related to dorsal pancreatic agenesis. This malformation is associated with other pancreatic disorders including pancreatitis and pancreatic tumors. Also, patients with this dysgenesis are usually accompanied with pancreatic exocrine dysfunction such as diabetes mellitus.
The prevalence and geographical pattern are unknown. First reported in 1911 by Heiberg in an autopsy.

Signs and symptoms
The agenesis of the dorsal pancreas is asymptomatic in most cases due to the functional reserves of exocrine and endocrine pancreas. Thereby it is often diagnosed incidentally by autopsy, surgery, endoscopy, or imaging technologies during evaluation of other diseases. Some common indicators reported by patients include abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice. Abdominal pain could be associated with acute or chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic tumor, diabetic autonomic neuropathy; and weight loss can also be due to diabetes mellitus in some patients.
The localisation of abdominal pain is at epigastrium and aggregates after meals. The two possible reasons for abdominal pain include the underdevelopment of the papillary muscle of the sphincter of Oddi or the autonomic neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus. Dorsal pancreatic agenesis is associated with diabetes mellitus because the β cells in the islets of Langerhans are present in the pancreatic body and tail, which are both absent in agenesis of the dorsal pancreas. Patients with dorsal pancreatic agenesis may result in a defect in the metabolism of hepatic glycogen, which may be related to the reduced β cell mass.

Associated conditions
Pancreatitis
Pancreatitis is a common disorder associated with dorsal pancreatic agenesis. However, it is unclear whether the high occurrence of pancreatitis is due to repetitive imaging procedures or whether it is a comorbidity of agenesis.

Diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus is an endocrine disease that is due to insufficient amount of insulin produced by the pancreas, and it is another common disease linked with dorsal pancreatic agenesis. Insulin is produced by the β cells of the islet of Langerhans in the dorsal pancreas. In patients with agenesis of the dorsal pan",medicine
Gain-ground,"Gain-ground games are team sports which are played with a small ball or a balloon. They are often outdoors on a ""ballodrome"" but can also be played indoors.
Among these games, longue paume and real tennis are the most well-known because they are played with rackets. The rules change a little depending on the game, but the basic rules remain identical from one game to the other.
Games of gain-ground are characterized in particular by the use of ""chasses"". Chasses indicate the limit between both teams or in real tennis a limit to score a point. Points are counted as in tennis: 15, 30, 40 and set.

Games of gain-ground
Two games in Jeu de paume:

Real tennis

Medicine shortage in Iran,"There have been shortages of many essential drugs in Iran, a crisis that began around 2013.  The crisis intensified in 2022 when Ebrahim Raisi’s administration removed the 42,000-rial exchange rate for the US dollar. Also in 2022, the Iranian government halted subsidies for the production of food and medicine, causing imported raw materials to cost seven times the price, thereby crippling domestic production of medicines. In the same year, the prices of essential drugs in the country were predicted to reach the 700% inflation mark.

Causes
The Food and Drug Organization of Iran has reported shortages of many essential drugs in the country. Reports of the crisis began emerging in 2013.  The crisis intensified in 2022 when Ebrahim Raisi’s administration removed the 42,000-rial exchange rate for the US dollar. Inflation further compounds the issue.
In 2022, the Iranian government under Ebrahim Raisi halted the subsidies for the production of food and medicine, forcing producers to pay seven times more for the import of raw materials, thereby crippling domestic production of medicines. This has caused a severe shortage in essential pharmaceutical products in local medical establishments, although the regime's pharmaceutical companies have continued to increase their profits by the production of sports supplements. In 2022, the Iranian Labour News Agency quoted Bahram Daraei, the regime’s head of the Iranian food and drug organization, as saying that the price increase of imported drugs was up to 6 times its original cost ""and domestically produced drugs increased in price by 30 to 100 percent, depending on the amount of raw material supply currency"". Both Iranian media and government officials have predicted that drug prices will continue to climb up to 700 percent. The rising medical costs for Iranian consumers has pushed thousands of those in need of treatment to the brink of bankruptcy. The shortage of medicine resulting from the price increase includes basic medical necessities, such as painkillers, IV fluids, antibiotics, anti-anxiety medication, Alendronic (bone density) and Omeprazole (stomach issues), as well as medicines with higher stakes, such as insulin, medications for asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Melphalan and Thiotepa (chemotherapy), Factor 8 (haemophilia), Interferon Beta and Diphosel (Multiple Sclerosis).
In some provinces, even locally produced medications are unavailable. The pharmaceutical sector experienced the second biggest production decline among all industries, with a 2.6% fall in production of pharmaceutical products in the spring and 18.5% in the summer, with other sources indicating that the total fall in production is about 30%. Some pharmaceutical companies have relocated from Iran to other countries.
Furthermore, there has been a 13.6% decrease in medicine imports. In addition, a shortage of imported raw materials used for producing medicines further contributes to the lack of local producti",medicine
10q26 deletion,"10q26 deletion is an extremely rare genetic syndrome caused by terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 10 at 10q26. It is usually a de novo mutation. Symptoms can include ""growth and mental retardation, microcephaly, triangular face, strabismus, hypertelorism, prominent nasal bridge, beaked or prominent nose, low-set dysplastic ears, various congenital heart defects, cryptorchidism, other anogenital anomalies, defect of hands/feet, limb contractures, abnormal behavior with hyperactivity, attention deficit, destructive tendency"". People with the syndrome are less likely to have hearing deficits compared to those where the missing genetic material includes 10q25. The syndrome was first reported in 1979. Interstitial deletions including parts of 10q26 also have been reported, but they are more rare.

Signs and symptoms
Individuals who have 10q26 deletion syndrome frequently experience delays in speech and the development of motor abilities, including sitting, crawling, and walking. Some people never speak well at all. ADHD, impulsivity, seizures, or autistic traits that interfere with social interaction and communication can all be symptoms of the condition.
Those who have 10q26 deletion syndrome may have a broad nasal bridge, a prominent or beaked nose, micrognathia, low-set deformed ears, a thin upper lip, and microcephaly. Many of the afflicted people have strabismus and hypertelorism. This illness can cause some people to develop webbed necks.
10q26 deletion syndrome may present with less typical indications and symptoms. Scoliosis, clinodactyly, and restricted range of motion in the elbows and other joints are examples of skeletal issues. In affected individuals, slow growth can also occur both before and after birth. Men who suffer from this illness may develop hypopadias, cryptorchidism, or a micropenis, among other genital abnormalities. Affected individuals with 10q26 deletion syndrome may also experience breathing difficulties, heart deformities, renal abnormalities, recurring infections, hearing, or visual issues.

Causes
A person who has a 10q26 deletion syndrome lacks 3.5–17 million base pairs, or 3.5–17 megabases (Mb), from location q26 on chromosome 10.  This abnormality is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that one copy of the mutated chromosome in each cell is enough to cause the ailment.

Century of humiliation,"The century of humiliation was a period in Chinese history beginning with the First Opium War (1839–1842), and ending in 1945 with China (then the Republic of China) emerging out of the Second World War as one of the Big Four and established as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, or alternately, ending in 1949 with the founding of the People's Republic of China. The century-long period is typified by the decline, defeat and political fragmentation of the Qing dynasty and the subsequent Republic of China, which led to demoralizing foreign intervention, annexation and subjugation of China by Western powers, Russia, and Japan.
The characterization of the period as a ""humiliation"" arose with an atmosphere of Chinese nationalism following China's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the subsequent events including the scramble for concessions in the late 1890s. Since then the idea of national humiliation became a focus of discussions among many Chinese writers and scholars, although they differed somewhat in their understandings of national humiliation; ordinary scholars and constitutionalists also had different understanding of their home country from the anti-Qing revolutionaries in the late Qing period. The idea of national humiliation was also mentioned in late Qing textbooks.
After the establishment of the Republic of China, the national humiliation idea grew further in opposition to the Twenty-One Demands made by the Japanese government in 1915, and with protests against China's poor treatment in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Both the Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party popularized the characterization in the 1920s, protesting the unequal treaties and loss of Chinese territory to foreign colonies. During the 1930s and 1940s, the term became common due to the Japanese invasion of China proper. Although formal treaty provisions were ended, the epoch remains central to concepts of Chinese nationalism, and the term is widely used in both political rhetoric and popular culture.

History
Chinese nationalists in the 1920s and the 1930s dated the century of humiliation to the mid-19th century, on the eve of the First Opium War amidst the dramatic political unraveling of Qing China that followed.
Defeats by foreign powers cited as part of the century of humiliation include the following:

Western and Japanese trade in opium to China (1800s–1940s)
Defeat in the First Opium War (1839–1842) by the British and the occupation of Hong Kong.
The unequal treaties (in particular, Nanjing, Whampoa, Aigun, and Shimonoseki)
Defeat in the Second Opium War (1856–1860) and the sacking and looting of the Old Summer Palace by Anglo-French forces.: 24 
The signing of the ""unequal treaties"" of Aigun (1858) and Peking (1860) during the Second Opium War, which ceded Outer Manchuria to Russia.
The partial defeat during the Sino-French War (1884–1885), which resulted in losing suzerainty over Vietnam and influence in the Indochin",history
Elma Sandford-Morgan,"Elma Sandford-Morgan (23 February 1890 – 1983) was an Australian physician who practised medicine in India and Iraq during the 1920s.
Elma Linton Sandford (later Mrs Sandford-Morgan) was born in Adelaide, South Australia in 1890. Her father, Alexander Wallace Sandford, a businessman and politician, died in 1905.  She was educated at a number of girls schools, before entering Cheltenham Ladies College in 1905. Her mother supported her decision to study medicine, and Sandford enrolled at the University of Sydney in 1910. She graduated with her M.D. in 1917.

Career
Sandford was appointed a resident medical officer at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in Sydney, and she then became senior medical registrar at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. She travelled to England in 1919 to study ophthalmology at the London hospitals. It was there that she heard about the urgent need for doctors in India to combat eye disease. She worked for a year at the Bhiwani Mission Women's Hospital around 1920, before taking a position in Baghdad at a hospital for women and children. It was in Baghdad, that she met British Army Officer Harry Morgan, and they were married in 1921. She worked in private practice in Baghdad until their daughter, Rosemary was born in 1922.
The Sandford-Morgans returned to Australia in 1923, and Dr Sandford-Morgan worked mainly in private practice, or for the Public Health Service in Hobart and Sydney. Their son, Gavin was born in 1925. Captain Morgan and Dr Sandford-Morgan separated, and she moved to Adelaide with their children around 1937. She was a director and developer of a Mothercraft training school. At a meeting of the Australian Federation of University Women in 1938, comments she made about women graduates and motherhood, made the national newspapers.

World War II
Sandford-Morgan assisted the Royal Australian Air Force Medical Service during World War II. She was appointed to a parliamentary commission investigating health services in South Australia at the close of the war. She wished to take up a position in Europe, and accepted a role as a medical officer at the Commonwealth Immigration camp in New South Wales. However, the transfer that was offered with this role to a European practice, was denied her as a woman. She resigned and sought employment on her own.

Later life
Sandford-Morgan returned to private practice in Australia, and then worked as a neoplasm registrar at the Anticancer Foundation of the University of Adelaide. She continued working until the age of 74 and thereafter volunteered at the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service until she was 80.
Sandford-Morgan was President of the Medical Women's Society of South Australia.
Elma Sandford-Morgan died in 1983. She is remembered for her pioneering work as a doctor.

Pato,"Pato, also called juego del pato (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈxweɣo ðel ˈpato], literally ""duck game""), is a game played on horseback that combines elements from polo and basketball. Since 1953 it has been the national sport of Argentina.

History
Pato is Spanish for ""duck"", as early games used a live duck inside a basket instead of a ball. Accounts of early versions of pato have been written since 1610. The playing field would often stretch the distance between neighboring estancias (ranches). The first team to reach its own casco (ranch house) with the duck would be declared the winner.
Pato was banned several times during its history because of the violence—not only to the duck; many gauchos were trampled underfoot, and many more died in knife fights started in the heat of the game. In 1796, a Catholic priest insisted that pato players who died in such a way should be denied Christian burial. Government ordinances forbidding the practice of pato were common throughout the 19th century.
During the 1930s, pato was regulated through the efforts of ranch owner Alberto del Castillo Posse, who drafted a set of rules inspired by modern polo. The game gained legitimacy, to the point that President Juan Perón declared pato to be Argentina's national game in 1953.

Gameplay
In modern pato, two four-member teams riding on horses fight for possession of a ball which has six conveniently-sized handles, and score by throwing the ball through a vertically positioned ring (as opposed to the horizontal rim used in basketball). The rings have a 100 cm (3.3 ft) diameter, and are located atop 240 cm (7.9 ft) high poles. A closed net, extending for 140 cm (4.6 ft), holds the ball after goals are scored.
The winner is the team with most goals scored after regulation time (six 8-minute ""periods"").
The dimensions of the field are: length 180 to 220 m (196.9 to 240.6 yd), width 80 to 90 m (87 to 98 yd). The ball is made of leather, with an inflated rubber chamber and six leather handles. Its diameter is 40 cm (15.7 in) handle-to-handle and its weight is 1050 to 1250 g (2.3 to 2.8 lbs).
The player that has control of the pato (i.e. holds the ball by a handle) must ride with his right arm outstretched, offering the pato so rival players have a chance of tugging the pato and stealing it. Not extending the arm while riding with the pato is an offense called negada (refusal).
During the tug itself, or cinchada, both players must stand on the stirrups and avoid sitting on the saddle, while the hand not involved in the tugging must hold the reins. The tug is usually the most exciting part of the game.
Pato is similar to the game of horseball played in France, Portugal, and other countries.

Popularity
Pato is played competitively and also by amateurs, mostly in weekend fairs which usually include doma (Argentine rodeo). Its status as the national game of Argentina has been challenged by association football, which is much more widespread. While virtually the entire population o",sports
Osterland,"Osterland (terra orientalis) is a historical region in Germany. It was situated between the Elbe and Saale rivers to the north of Pleissnerland which it later absorbed and it included the city of Leipzig. The name derives from the previous name of the territory, Ostmark, meaning ""eastern march.""
Today, the area belongs to the German states of Thuringia and Saxony.

Kevin K. Cheng,"Kevin K. Cheng (born around 1945), developed the Phoenix total artificial heart, first used in a human in 1985 in an emergency in a person whose donor heart was being acutely rejected. Cheng was a dentist by profession and the Phoenix heart he designed was originally developed to be implanted into a young cow. The recipient Thomas Creighton, who was dying from a failing heart, survived the artificial heart operation and 11 hours later a human heart was transplanted. The cause of death less than two days afterwards was not due to the artificial heart.
Cheng had fled China with his family at the age of four, spent his childhood and completed his education in Taiwan and then settled in the United States. His past time of designing artificial hearts took him from Texas to Phoenix, where he developed artificial hearts for transplantation into cows.

Early life
Kevin K. Cheng fled China on a boat with his parents at the age of four. They settled in Taiwan, where he became skilled at drawing, building models and then engineering. He gained admission to study medicine at Kaohsiung Medical College, where dental students and medical students received the same initial education and later in 1973, he moved to Houston, United States. After a few months he found a job as a research associate in the cardiovascular laboratory at the Texas Heart Institute and over the next 30 months he designed and built 36 artificial hearts that were implanted in calves.
In 1978, Cheng decided to go to the University of Texas Dental School in Houston and subsequently moved to the University of Texas at Galveston to work with people with cancer. The whole time, he continued to build and redesign artificial hearts.

The Phoenix total artificial heart
Failing to gain support from the surgeons he spoke to and being unsuccessful in his application for a  grant from the National Institutes of Health, he by chance met technician Jon Austin at St. Luke's Hospital, Phoenix and feeling that there may be hope of progressing with his artificial hearts, Cheng moved to Phoenix and opened a general and reconstructive dental clinic. After being introduced to heart surgeon Cecil Vaughn and veterinarian Peter Bates in 1983, Cheng was given space in a laboratory to carry out experimental work. In 1984, Vaughn and Cheng implanted the first Phoenix artificial heart in a calf and subsequently performed another three such procedures, with the longest survival of more than 12 hours.
The next planned artificial heart procedure in 1985, was however cancelled when Vaughn was called to an emergency. Then, on 6 March 1985, Cheng was informed that his artificial heart was needed in desperation by 33-year old Thomas Creighton, 120 miles away at the University of Arizona Medical Center. Creighton had been transplanted a human heart the previous day, by surgeon Jack Copeland, but the donor heart failed.
Cheng, Vaughn and a technician transported the artificial heart via helicopter and chartered jet, from Phoeni",medicine

Historical era,"Human history or world history is the record of humankind from prehistory to the present. Modern humans evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago and initially lived as hunter-gatherers. They migrated out of Africa during the Last Ice Age and had spread across Earth's continental land except Antarctica by the end of the Ice Age 12,000 years ago. Soon afterward, the Neolithic Revolution in West Asia brought the first systematic husbandry of plants and animals, and saw many humans transition from a nomadic life to a sedentary existence as farmers in permanent settlements. The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing.
These developments paved the way for the emergence of early civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, and China, marking the beginning of the ancient period in 3500 BCE. These civilizations supported the establishment of regional empires and acted as a fertile ground for the advent of transformative philosophical and religious ideas, initially Hinduism during the late Bronze Age, and – during the Axial Age: Buddhism, Confucianism, Greek philosophy, Jainism, Judaism, Taoism, and Zoroastrianism. The subsequent post-classical period, from about 500 to 1500 CE, witnessed the rise of Islam and the continued spread and consolidation of Christianity while civilization expanded to new parts of the world and trade between societies increased. These developments were accompanied by the rise and decline of major empires, such as the Byzantine Empire, the Islamic caliphates, the Mongol Empire, and various Chinese dynasties. This period's invention of gunpowder and of the printing press greatly affected subsequent history.
During the early modern period, spanning from approximately 1500 to 1800 CE, European powers explored and colonized regions worldwide, intensifying cultural and economic exchange. This era saw substantial intellectual, cultural, and technological advances in Europe driven by the Renaissance, the Reformation in Germany giving rise to Protestantism, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment. By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the Industrial Revolution, substantial to the Great Divergence, and began the modern period starting around 1800 CE. The rapid growth in productive power further increased international trade and colonization, linking the different civilizations in the process of globalization, and cemented European dominance throughout the 19th century. Over the last quarter-millennium, which included two devastating world wars, there has been a great acceleration in many spheres, including human population, agriculture, industry, commerce, scientific knowledge, technology, communications, military capabilities, and environmental degradation.

Biribol,"Biribol is a sport, which resembles an aquatic variation of volleyball. 

It has originated in Brazil, in the city of Birigüi, in the 1960s by Prof. Dario Miguel Pedro. It showed up as a group game and as an alternative to the practice and the learning of swimming.

Field
Its game is played inside a pool which size is 8m length, 4m width and 1.30m depth (the depth must be this for the entire pool) with a net in the middle of the pool with 2.62m high for the male and with 2.40m high for the female practice.
The game space is constituted by 7m high measured from the surface of the water. There is also an attack area, delimited by a line which cross the pool by 1.25m from where the net is in each side. There are lines that delimit the service area, by the end of the pool, 1m from its length limit and other 0.8m from its width limit.

Rules
Game ball
The ball is specially crafted ball similar to that of water polo but with a smaller diameter. The ball weights approximately 100 grams more than the volleyball one and employs a ""super grip"" surface technology. The official game is played with four players on each side, but there is also the doubles modality, with two players on each side. Biribol is a highly recommended sport for working all muscle groups with practically no injury risks due to its no contact, low impact on joints nature. Biribol is also suited for all ages and genders, and is recommended for people with minor chronic injuries that feel discomfort or pain while playing other sports.

Game play
Matches are decided in best-of-three or best-of-five sets of 21 points, when the matches go up to the last set this set is disputed up to the 20th point instead, and a team needs at least two points of advantage in any circumstance to win a set. So if a 21-points set is drawn at 20x20, the match is extended to 22 points, and so on. 
The ball can be touched with any part of the player's body, with open or closed hands. The pool's inside borders are neutral, meaning the ball is normally in play after touching them, points are scored when the ball hits the water in the opponents' side or the opponent team commits a fault. As in volleyball, each team can contact the ball no more than three times before the ball crosses the net, while consecutive contacts must be made by different players - except for contacts while blocking, which are not counted. Players also cannot touch the net or they commit a fault and a point is awarded to the opponent team. Unique to the sport is that there is no penetration under and over the net - it is even allowed to block a set being executed in the opponents' side -, the possibility of blocking serves and how there is no lifting (carrying) faults during spikes.
With its fast moving, highly accurate ball and 'closed quarters' action, Biribol is also an extremely competitive sport and enjoys a popularity similar to or greater than water volleyball in southern Brazil. There is currently a Brazilian National League  with team",sports
ABC countries,"The ABC countries, or ABC powers, are the South American countries of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, seen as the three most powerful, influential and wealthiest countries in South America. The term was mostly used in the first half of the 20th century, when the three countries worked together to develop common interests and a coordinated approach to issues in the region with relatively little influence from outside powers.

History
During the early 20th century Argentina, Brazil, and Chile engaged in a naval arms race, beginning with Brazil purchasing three dreadnoughts in response to the recently concluded Argentine–Chilean naval arms race.
The Niagara Falls peace conference is the first well-known use of the term ""ABC"". On May 20, 1914, the three countries met in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, to mediate between the United States and Mexico after increasing tensions over the  Tampico Affair, the United States occupation of Veracruz, and developing issues that led to the Mexican Revolution. At the conference, the United States was represented by Frederick William Lehmann, a former United States Solicitor General, and Joseph Rucker Lamar, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
In 1942, the ABC countries, with the United States, mediated in the peace terms of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War. This led to the loss of all disputed territory in the Amazon Basin that had been claimed by Ecuador before the war.

Energy efficiency in agriculture,"Energy efficiency in agriculture refers to reducing the amount of energy required to provide agricultural products and services. The European Commission has policies related to energy efficiency, including in agriculture. The European Union has established measures to promote energy efficiency, including setting targets for energy savings, and requiring energy audits and management plans for large companies. The AGREE project conducted studies on energy efficiency in different agricultural production systems and proposed measures for improvement. The results of the project were summarized in reports that highlighted the opportunities and drawbacks for energy efficiency in agriculture in different European countries. Improving energy efficiency in agriculture contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

European Commission definitions
Energy in general
European Commission definitions of energy efficiency, are given below: 

Energy efficiency — a ratio between an output of performance, service, goods or energy, and an input of energy;
Energy efficiency improvement — an increase in energy end-use efficiency as a result of technological, behavioural and/or economic changes;
Energy savings — an amount of saved energy determined by measuring and/or estimating consumption before and after implementation of one or more energy efficiency improvement measures, whilst ensuring normalization for external conditions that affect energy consumption;
According to article 2(d) of the Regulation (EC) No1099/2008 on energy statistics:

Energy — means all forms of energy products (combustible fuels, heat, renewable energy, electricity, or any other form of energy)
Primary energy consumption — means gross inland consumption, excluding non-energy uses
Final energy consumption — means all energy supplied to industry, transport, households, services and agriculture. It excludes deliveries to the energy transformation sector and the energy industries themselves.

Energy in agriculture
Primary energy consumption (PEC) in agriculture is the energy consumed in an agricultural production system (within the farm limits) including the energy for the production of all indirect inputs.
Energy efficiency in agriculture improvement is defined as the decrease of primary energy consumption for the production of a unit of agricultural product (expressed in weight or volume units), within the farm boundaries.

European Union policies
European Commission requirements regarding energy use across the EU (Directive 2012/27/EU) establish a common framework of measures for the promotion of energy efficiency within the European Union to:

Ensure the achievement of the Union’s 2020 20% headline target on energy efficiency
Pave the way for further energy efficiency improvements beyond that date
The directive also:

Lays down rules designed to remove barriers in the energy market and overcome market failures that impede efficiency in the supply and use of energy.

History of the Pacific Islands,"The history of the Pacific Islands covers the history of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.

Histories
Cook Islands
In Cook Islands Māori pre-history, Chieftains from present day French Polynesia and their tribes, along with navigators, took their ships in search of unknown or newly found lands, first arriving in the southern island groups around 800 AD or earlier. Many other tribal migrations from French Polynesia, notably Tahiti would continue for centuries forming a unique Māori society.
Similarly, the northern islands were also settled from the east, with some of the northern islands possibly having had later interactions with Western Polynesia. The capital Rarotonga, is known, from various oral histories to have been the launching site of seven waka ship voyagers who settled in New Zealand, becoming the major tribes of the New Zealand Māori. Up until relatively recently there was continuous contact between both lands where back and forth migration and trade took place. The Cook Islands Te Reo Māori language is closely related to the Te Reo Maori indigenous language of New Zealand.  Spanish ships visited the islands in the 16th century; the first written record of contact with the islands came with the sighting of Pukapuka by Spanish sailor Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira in 1595 who called it San Bernardo (Saint Bernard). A few years later, a Spanish expedition led by Pedro Fernandes de Queirós made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on Rakahanga in 1606, calling it Gente Hermosa (Beautiful People). The country is named after British captain Captain James Cook who surveyed and landed on some of the islands between 1774 and 1777.

Easter Island
Easter Island is one of the youngest inhabited territories on earth, and for most of the history of Easter Island it was the most isolated inhabited territory on Earth. Its inhabitants, the Rapa Nui, have endured famines, epidemics, civil war, slave raids, and colonialism; have seen their population crash on more than one occasion.

Fiji
The history of Fiji dates back to ancient times. There are many theories as to how the Fijian race came into existence. Around 1500 BC Fiji was settled by Austronesian seafarers. Around 900–600 BC Moturiki Island was settled. By 500 BC, Melanesian seafarers had reached Fiji and intermarried with the Austronesian inhabitants, giving rise to the modern Fijian people. In 1643 AD, Abel Tasman sighted Vanua Levu Island and northern Taveuni. According to native oral legends Fijians were also descendants of a nomadic tribe from Tanganika (Tanzania).

Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands
The history of Guam involves phases including the early arrival of people known today as the ancient Chamorros, the development of ""pre-contact"" society, Spanish colonization, and the present American rule of the island. Archaeologists using carbon-dating have broken Pre-Contact Guam (i.e. Chamorro) history into three periods: ""Pre-Latte"" (BC 2000? to AD 1) ""Transit",history
Apple cider vinegar,"Apple cider vinegar, or cider vinegar, is a vinegar made from cider, and used in salad dressings, marinades, vinaigrettes, food preservatives, and chutneys. It is made by crushing apples, then squeezing out the juice. The apple juice is then fermented by yeast which converts the sugars in the juice to ethanol. In a second fermentation step, the ethanol is converted into acetic acid by acetic acid-forming bacteria (Acetobacter species), yielding cider vinegar. The acetic acid, together with the malic acid naturally present in apple juice, contribute to the sour taste of this vinegar.
There is no high-quality clinical evidence that regular consumption of apple cider vinegar helps to maintain or lose body weight,  or is effective to manage blood glucose and lipid levels.

Production
Apples are loaded onto a processing belt where they are washed, crushed, pressed, and the juice separated. Autochthonous or inoculated yeasts, mainly Saccharomyces cerevisiae, initiate alcoholic fermentation, converting the sugars in the juice into ethanol and producing apple cider. The apple cider is then inoculated with either a pure culture of acetic acid bacteria or a proportion of 'mother vinegar', resulting in a secondary acetic fermentation which  then converts the ethanol in the cider to acetic acid, yielding apple cider vinegar. The ""mother"" is an undefined microbial culture left in the vinegar prior to distilling and pasteurization.

Nutrition
Apple cider vinegar is 94% water and 5% acetic acid with 1% carbohydrates and no fat or protein (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, it provides 90 kilojoules (22 kcal) of energy, with negligible content of micronutrients.

Health effects
Despite its history of use in traditional medicine, due to inadequate research of high quality, the evidence for the health effects of apple cider vinegar is insufficient to support any health claims – such as for weight loss, glycemic control or skin infections – in humans, and its use is not recommended for any indication in medical guidelines of major public health organizations or regulatory agencies.

Safety concerns
Moderate consumption of apple cider vinegar is safe, particularly if it is diluted, and the chance of side effects when it is consumed as directed and in the recommended amounts appears to be low. Reported adverse effects include esophageal damage due to incomplete swallowing of apple cider vinegar tablets, tooth enamel damage due to swallowing excessive quantities of apple cider vinegar, and increased frequency of burping, flatulence, and bowel movements. Consumption of vinegar can increase dentin hypersensitivity. Irritation and redness are common when the eyes come into contact with vinegar, and corneal injury can occur. Using vinegar as a topical medication, ear cleaning solution, or eye wash is hazardous. Although small amounts of apple cider vinegar may be used as a food flavoring, it may be unsafe for use by pregnant and breastfeeding women and by children. D",medicine
Applications of cybernetics in economics,"Economics is one domain in which cybernetics has had application and influence.

In the Soviet Union
The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia defines Economic cybernetics as a scientific field wherein cybernetic approaches are applied to economics. It facilitates a dialogue between microsystems and macrosystems.
The design of self-regulating control systems for a real-time planned economy was explored by economist Oskar Lange, cyberneticist Viktor Glushkov, and other Soviet cyberneticists during the 1960s. By the time information technology was developed enough to enable feasible economic planning based on computers, the Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries began moving away from planning and eventually collapsed.

Project Cybersyn
Hayek
Friedrich Hayek attended the 1960 Symposium on Principles of Self-Organization, organised by Heinz von Foerster.
Hayek mentions cybernetics as a discipline that could help economists understand the ""self-organizing or self-generating systems"" called markets. Being ""complex phenomena"", the best way to examine market functions is by using the feedback mechanism, explained by cybernetic theorists. That way, economists could make ""pattern predictions"".
Therefore, the market for Hayek is a ""communication system"", an ""efficient mechanism for digesting dispersed information"". The economist and a cyberneticist are like gardeners who are ""providing the appropriate environment"". Hayek's definition of information is idiosyncratic and precedes the information theory used in cybernetics and the natural sciences.
Finally, Hayek also considers Adam Smith's idea of the invisible hand as an anticipation of the operation of the feedback mechanism in cybernetics. In the same book, Law, Legislation and Liberty, Hayek mentions, along with cybernetics, that economists should rely on the scientific findings of Ludwig von Bertalanffy general systems theory, along with information and communication theory and semiotics.

Towards a New Socialism
A proposal for a ""New Socialism"" was outlined by the computer scientists Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell in 1995 (Towards a New Socialism), where computers determine and manage the flows and allocation of resources among socially owned enterprises.

Telecommunications in Malaysia,"The primary regulator of telecommunications in Malaysia is the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). It issues licenses under the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, the Postal Services Act 2012 and the Digital Signature Act 1997.

SARAWAKFor Sarawak, Sarawak Multimedia Authority (SMA)  is the operating regulatory body established pursuant to Section 3 of Sarawak Multimedia Authority Ordinance 2017 which allows the Sarawak Government to spearhead, oversee and facilitate the development and implementation of the communication, multimedia and Sarawak's Digital Economy Initiatives within the region.
Contrary to critics' claims, SMA and MCMC complement one another in managing and developing Sarawak's telecommunication and digitalisation sector, and have been in a cooperative relationship since SMA's inception in 2017.
In 2022, the Telecommunication Division was added as a portfolio to the then Sarawak Ministry of Public Utilities (now Sarawak Ministry of Utility and Telecommunication), effectively allowing the ministry to monitor and manage as well as report the development of telecommunication and digitalisation sector in the region directly to the Sarawak Legislative Assembly (Dewan Undangan Sarawak) sessions.

History
The British, who had a presence in Malaysia from the 18th century, were responsible for setting up the country's earliest telecommunications facilities, which eventually evolved into TM. They first establishing telegraph lines under the Posts & Telegraphs Department, and telephones made their debut in the late 19th century, with the earliest hand-cranked Magneto operated devices used in Perak in the 1880s. The country's first public telephone exchange was also set up in Ipoh in 1902.
In 1891, telephones made its debut in Kuala Lumpur. At the turn of the century, a major telephony line from Province Wellesley (Seberang Prai) in Penang to Johor Bahru was built.  In 1915, the first underground cable was laid linking Ipoh, Taiping, Kampar and Teluk Anson.
Along with increased trade and the development of townships, the number of telephone subscribers in Peninsular Malaysia increased significantly. By 1930, to deal with the volume of telephony traffic, an automated magneto exchange was commissioned in Kuala Lumpur on Jalan Weld. In the 1930s, all telephone exchanges in the Malayan Trunk System could communicate with exchanges in Java, the Philippines, the United States, Canada and Mexico using shortwave radio-telephone transmitters. Towards the end of the decade, a Marconi Radio Terminal was installed at the Kuala Lumpur Telephone Exchange to handle overseas calls.
Much of this telecommunications infrastructure was damaged during the Second World War and the Japanese occupation. In 1946, when the British re-established their position in Malaya, they repaired the trunk routes, restored fallen telephone poles and installed the copper wires that had either been damaged or stolen. During the Japanese occupation, the P",technology
Accountable autonomy,"Accountable autonomy is an institutional design of administrative and democratic organization that tries to maximize civic participation and deliberation. Political scientist Archon Fung coined the term. Accountable autonomy addresses the defects of decentralization and localism, such as group-think, inequality, and parochialism, through hybrid arrangements that allocate political power, function and responsibility between central authorities and local bodies. The terms “accountable” and “autonomy” might seem at odds. Autonomy means independence from central power and the capacity to accomplish its ends. The second sense is what Fung stresses: ‘a conception of centralized action that counter-intuitively bolsters local capability without improperly and destructively encroaching upon it.’
Two examples of this agency structure are Chicago's Alternative Policing Strategy and Local School Councils.

Design
The design of accountable autonomy exists in prescriptions for the efficacy of civic participation:

Increasing discretion of street-level officials  with respect to formal rules and centralized oversight, while making their actions transparent and open to critique for civilians;
Generating innovations through engaging the local knowledge of civilians and diffusing insights through benchmarking of best practices;
Having cross-functional coordination, not a rigid division of labor;
Enhancing neighbourhood trust through tests of collaboration.
Fung argues that accountable autonomy increases fairness, because it offers ways for the least advantaged to act constructively against unfairness and it offers opportunities for civilians to deliberate about prioritization of problems and strategies to solve them.

Telecommunications in Barbados,"Communications in Barbados refers to the telephony, internet, postal, radio, and television systems of Barbados.  Barbados has long been an informational and communications centre in the Caribbean region.  Electricity coverage throughout Barbados is good and reliable. Usage is high and provided by a service monopoly, Barbados Light & Power Company Ltd. (a division of Canada-based Emera).
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) call sign prefix allocated for all radio and television broadcasts in Barbados is 8P, and this replaced the former ZN and VP6 as a British territory.

History
Barbados has had various forms of Communications as early as the 1840s.  Some of the earliest expressions of inter-island communication includes a number of signal stations built along the high points of the island to relay acts of transgression towards the island to the Saint Ann's Garrison on the south-west coast.  The first telephone network in the country was developed in 1884. As the former British Empire's All Red Line came into existence during the early 1900s, Barbados played an important role as a crucial link in the trans-Atlantic communications network.  By 1935 a hard wired cable-based radio network was later deployed throughout the country to broadcast the Rediffusion service directly from London to homes and business across Barbados.
In 2001 the Government of Barbados and the local Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) provider, Cable & Wireless signed a MOU beginning a phased process of liberalisation of the international segment of Barbados' telecommunications sector.  The process was aimed at bringing Barbados' sector into compliance with the World Trade Organization (WTO). The plan outlined the first phase commencing on 1 December 2001 and the entire process ending with full liberalisation being achieved on 1 August 2003.  As these target dates were missed, the Phase I process was later commenced on 1 November 2002, with Phase II and III beginning on 16 November 2003 and 21 February 2004 respectively. Full liberalisation was attained in February, 2005, for the international telecommunications services market.

Frost resistance,"Frost resistance is the ability of plants to survive cold temperatures. Generally, land plants of the northern hemisphere have higher frost resistance than those of the southern hemisphere. An example of a frost resistant plant is Drimys winteri which is more frost-tolerant than naturally occurring conifers and vessel-bearing angiosperms such as the Nothofagus that can be found in its range in southern South America. 
The physiological process of cold acclimatization is induced in fall and early winter by low above- zero temperatures (cold) and includes complex reprogramming of the cellular environment to induce enhanced frost tolerance.Temperate climate fruit trees reach their highest resistance in the middle of winter. Since freezing belongs to dehydration stresses, cold acclimation process is associated with an enhanced accumulation of osmolytes (sugars, proline, polyamines, and hydrophilic proteins).  The loss of frost resistance occurs after warming. Rapid temperature fluctuations during winter deharden trees and increase the risk of spring damage. Species that bloom first  even before the leaves develop like apricots or peaches, are particularly vulnerable to damage. The reproductive organs, due to their abundant hydration, are easily damaged, leading to large losses in the cultivation of fruit trees and shrubs.

History of alternative medicine,"The history of alternative medicine covers the history of a group of diverse medical practices that were collectively promoted as ""alternative medicine"" beginning in the 1970s, to the collection of individual histories of members of that group, or to the history of western medical practices that were labeled ""irregular practices"" by the western medical establishment. It includes the histories of complementary medicine and of integrative medicine. ""Alternative medicine"" is a loosely defined and very diverse set of products, practices, and theories that are perceived by its users to have the healing effects of medicine, but do not originate from evidence gathered using the scientific method, are not part of biomedicine, or are contradicted by scientific evidence or established science. ""Biomedicine"" is that part of medical science that applies principles of anatomy, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and other natural sciences to clinical practice, using scientific methods to establish the effectiveness of that practice.
Much of what is now categorized as alternative medicine was developed as independent, complete medical systems, was developed long before biomedicine and use of scientific methods, and was developed in relatively isolated regions of the world where there was little or no medical contact with pre-scientific western medicine, or with each other's systems. Examples are traditional Chinese medicine, European humoral theory and the Ayurvedic medicine of India. Other alternative medicine practices, such as homeopathy, were developed in western Europe and in opposition to western medicine, at a time when western medicine was based on unscientific theories that were dogmatically imposed by western religious authorities. Homeopathy was developed prior to discovery of the basic principles of chemistry, which proved homeopathic remedies contained nothing but water. But homeopathy, with its remedies made of water, was harmless compared to the unscientific and dangerous orthodox western medicine practiced at that time, which included use of toxins and draining of blood, often resulting in permanent disfigurement or death. Other alternative practices such as chiropractic and osteopathy, were developed in the United States at a time that western medicine was beginning to incorporate scientific methods and theories, but the biomedical model was not yet fully established. Practices such as chiropractic and osteopathy, each considered to be irregular by the medical establishment, also opposed each other, both rhetorically and politically with licensing legislation. Osteopathic practitioners added the courses and training of biomedicine to their licensing, and licensed Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine holders began diminishing use of the unscientific origins of the field, and without the original practices and theories, osteopathic medicine in the United States is now considered the same as biomedicine.

De Morbis Artificum Diatriba,"The De Morbis Artificum Diatriba (Dissertation on Workers' Diseases) is the first book exploring working environments with the aim to identify the hazards that could harm health and cause specific disorders in individuals and in groups of workers who carried out the same activity (occupational diseases)(Di Pietro P 1999, Carnevale F et al. 2009). It was written in Latin by Bernardino Ramazzini and published in Modena in 1700. In 1713 the second edition was printed in Padua. For this work Ramazzini is the acknowledged father of occupational medicine (Pagel JL 1891; Garrison FH 1934) and the Diatriba has been cited by Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and Cotton Mather.

The birth of the Diatriba
The book describes Ramazzini’s observations made as a doctor and as an investigator of the territory, combining clinical remarks of the patient-worker with the description of working conditions and techniques, and related risks to health (Di Pietro P 1999). In 54 chapters the book reports health risks faced by workers in more than one hundred occupations and currently it is considered the first textbook of occupational medicine (Franco G 1999; Carnevale F et al 2009, Carnevale F 2016) and a precursor of  occupational health (Franco G 2021).
The Diatriba describes specific disorders in individuals and in groups of workers carrying out the same activity. Whereas some clinical pictures deserve only a historical interest, several disorders represent even today a health problem for specific groups of workers. Ramazzini proposed several precautions for the prevention of diseases whose basic idea, mostly based on common sense, was correctly conceived.

Musculoskeletal disorders
Much space is dedicated to the discussion of musculoskeletal disorders in workers employed in many jobs. Ramazzini understood that different morbid pictures were associated with postures, movement repetition, weight lifting, muscular load, which today define the ergonomic factors (Franco G & Fusetti L 2004). The Diatriba lists 26 different occupations, from brick-makers to sailors and from printers to writers and notaries, affected by all kinds of musculoskeletal disorders (Franco G 2010).

Stress-related health disorders
Ramazzini identified stress-related health disorders associated with circumstances involving high job demands and repetitive job activity. In addition to the continuous sitting responsible for sedentariness issues, he detected in accounting clerks the psychological stress to avoid mistakes or cause loss to their employers and keenly noted that an intense application of the mind harmed those workers (Franco G 2020a).

Breast cancer in nuns
Ramazzini described consumptive affections mostly in heavy occupations such as miners. However, he also made an explicit reference to tumors. In fact, he reported that breast cancers were very often found in nuns’ breasts more than in any other women. He explained that it might be due to their celibate life. This remark anticipated the observation ",medicine

Baby Scoop Era,"The Baby Scoop Era was a period in anglosphere history starting after the end of World War II and ending in the early 1970s, characterized by an increasing rate of pre-marital pregnancies over the preceding period, along with a higher rate of newborn adoption.

History
In the United States
From 1945 to 1973, it is estimated that up to 4 million parents in the United States had children placed for adoption, with 2 million during the 1960s alone. Annual numbers for non-relative adoptions increased from an estimated 33,800 in 1951 to a peak of 89,200 in 1970, then quickly declined to an estimated 47,700 in 1975.  (This does not include the number of infants adopted and raised by relatives.) In contrast, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that only 14,000 infants were placed for adoption in 2003.
This period of history has been documented in scholarly books such as Wake Up Little Susie and Beggars and Choosers, both by historian Rickie Solinger, and social histories such as the book The Girls Who Went Away and the documentary, A Girl Like Her, based on the book by Ann Fessler.  Fessler is a professor of photography at the Rhode Island School of Design who exhibited an art installation titled The Girls Who Went Away.  It is also the theme of the documentary ""Gone To A Good Home"" by Film Australia.
Beginning in the 1940s and 1950s, illegitimacy began to be defined in terms of psychological deficits on the part of the mother.  At the same time, a liberalization of sexual morals combined with restrictions on access to birth control led to an increase in premarital pregnancies.  The dominant psychological and social work view was that the large majority of unmarried mothers were better off being separated by adoption from their newborn babies.  According to Mandell (2007), ""In most cases, adoption was presented to the mothers as the only option and little or no effort was made to help the mothers keep and raise the children"".
Solinger describes the social pressures that led to this unusual trend, explaining that women who had no control over their reproductive lives were defined by psychological theory as ""not-mothers"", and that because they had no control over their reproductive lives, they were subject to the ideology of those who watched over them. As such, for unmarried pregnant girls and women in the pre-Roe era, the main chance for attaining home and marriage rested on their acknowledging their alleged shame and guilt, and this required relinquishing their children, with more than 80% of unwed mothers in maternity homes acting in essence as ""breeders"" for adoptive parents. According to Ellison, from 1960 to 1970, 27% of all births to married women between the ages of 15 and 29 were conceived premaritally. This problem was thought to be caused by female neurosis, and those who could not procure an abortion, legally or otherwise, were encouraged to put up their children for adoption.

Global Swing States,"Global Swing States refer to countries whose strategic choices have a significant impact on the international order due to their geopolitical influence, economic power, and diplomatic capabilities. These nations are considered pivotal in shaping global governance structures, balancing power dynamics, and influencing international norms and policies.

Characteristics
Global Swing States are countries that are considered leading middle powers. They possess certain key characteristics that distinguish them from other nations. These characteristics include:

Geopolitical influence: They hold considerable sway in regional and global geopolitics, often acting as power brokers or regional leaders. However, they do not have the capacity to directly impose their influence globally.
Economic power: These states have robust economies that contribute significantly to global trade, investment, and economic stability.
Diplomatic capability: They possess the diplomatic clout to engage with multiple major powers and influence international negotiations and policies.
Military strength: Their military capabilities enable them to play crucial roles in regional security and global stability.
Soft power: They wield cultural, ideological, and political influence that extends beyond their borders.

Role in global governance and geopolitics
Global Swing States play a crucial role in global governance and geopolitics. Their strategic decisions can alter the balance of power, influence international norms, and drive global policy discussions. For instance, their positions on climate change, trade, and security are essential for forming international agreements and coalitions.

Geopolitical leverage
The influence of Global Swing States is heightened by their ability to balance between major powers. This leverage is evident in their transactional foreign policies, where they often play one superpower against another to maximize their national interests. For example, India's involvement in the Quad enhances its strategic positioning vis-à-vis China, while Brazil and Indonesia benefit from Chinese investment in critical minerals.

Climate policy influence
These states also hold significant sway in international climate policy. Brazil and Indonesia are crucial for efforts to combat deforestation, while India and Indonesia are key players in decarbonization initiatives. Programs like the Just Energy Transition Partnership highlight their leadership in financing climate goals, with South Africa and Indonesia as notable participants.

Impact on the Russia–Ukraine War
Global Swing States have notably influenced the international response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Their refusal to align fully with Western sanctions on Russia demonstrates their independent stance and highlights their role in mediating global conflicts. Turkey, in particular, has emerged as a crucial mediator, facilitating grain deals and peace talks.

Today, it denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir (which consists of Jammu and the Kashmir Valley), Ladakh, the Pakistan-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Chinese-administered regions of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.
In the first half of the 1st millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later—under the Mauryas and Kushanas—of Buddhism. Later in the ninth century, during the rule of the Karkota Dynasty, a native tradition of Shaivism arose. It flourished in the seven centuries of Hindu rule, continuing under the Utpala and the Lohara dynasties, ending in mid-14th century.
The spread of Islam in Kashmir began during the 13th century, accelerated under Muslim rule during the 14th and 15th centuries, and led to the eventual decline of Kashmiri Shaivism in the region.
In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Shah Mir dynasty. For the next five centuries, Muslim monarchs ruled Kashmir, including the Mughal Empire, who ruled from 1586 until 1751, and the Afghan Durrani Empire, which ruled from 1747 until 1819. That year, the Sikhs, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir. In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, the Treaty of Lahore was signed and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage) of the British Crown, lasted until 1947, when the former princely state became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: India, Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China.

Etymology
According to folk etymology, the name ""Kashmir"" means ""desiccated land"" (from the Sanskrit: ka = water and shimīra = desiccate). In the Rajatarangini, a history of Kashmir written by Kalhana in the mid-12th century, it is stated that the valley of Kashmir was formerly a lake. According to Hindu mythology, the lake was drained by the great rishi or sage, Kashyapa, son of Marichi, son of Brahma, by cutting the gap in the hills at Baramulla (Varaha-mula). When Kashmir had been drained, Kashyapa asked Brahmins to settle there. This is still the local tradition, and in the existing physical condition of the country, there is some ground for the story which has taken this form. The name of Kashyapa is by history and tradition connected with the draining of the lake, and the chief town or collection of dwellings in the valley was called Kashyapa-pura, which has been identified with Kaspapyros of Hecataeus (apud Stephanus of Byzantium) and Kaspatyros of Herodotus (3.102, 4",history
Beach polo,"Beach polo is a team sport and close variant of arena polo.

Game play
A game of beach polo consists of two three-player teams as opposed to the usual four-player teams in field polo. A game consists of four seven-minute periods of play, called chukkers. The game is played in an enclosed sand arena with sideboards of approximately four feet in height, designed to keep the ball in play. Depending on playing areas available, some of the playing arenas have enclosed ends while others allow for 20 yards of run out room for the horses, past the end line, and utilize standing goal posts.
Two umpires are suggested for tournament play which may be stationed outside the arena to officiate the game. Penalties are called and resulting free hits are awarded to the fouled party.
Traditional polo ponies are used with players changing horses following each chukker.
Unlike the hard plastic ball used in field polo, beach polo employs a leather or rubber inflated ball no less than 12.5 inches in circumference. Other equipment employed is the same as that used in field or arena polo.

History
Reto Gaudenzi and Rashid Al Habtoor have been credited with the creation of the game in 2004 in Dubai, followed by the Miami Beach Polo World Cup in the United States in 2005 which also was created by Reto Gaudenzi and his son Tito. Reto Gaudenzi is also the inventor of Snow Polo that initiated in 1985 on the frozen lake of St. Moritz. Additional tournaments matches have arisen in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, England, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, Thailand, The Netherlands, Uruguay and Wales.
The most notable event of this kind continues to take place annually in Miami Beach. Having featured some of the best international polo players include Argentine 10-goaler Gonzalo Pieres, 8-goaler Alejandro Novillo Astrada, Mexico's late Carlos Gracida (9), USA's 9-goaler Nic Roldan amongst many more. This event is organized by Tito Gaudenzi and Melissa Ganzi to this day.
The island of Jersey (off the coast of Normandy, France) staged its first beach polo tournament in September 2012 while New Zealand staged a tournament in December 2013, and Croatia created their first beach polo event in 2016.

Electronics industry in East Germany,"East Germany was one of the leading computer producers in the Eastern Bloc as purchases of higher technologies from the West were under various embargoes. A program of illegal purchases, copying and reverse engineering of Western examples was established, after which GDR sold these computers to COMECON countries. Under the rule of Erich Honecker, electronics, microelectronics and data processing industries grew at average 11.4% in the 1970s and 12.9% during the 1980s.

Structure in 1989
In the years just before German Reunification, the electronics industry was structured into business conglomerates called Kombinate (combine). Semiconductor manufacturing equipment was produced by Kombinat Carl Zeiss Jena. Using this equipment VEB Kombinat Elektronische Bauelemente Teltow manufactured passive electronic components and VEB Kombinat Mikroelektronik Erfurt active electronic components. In turn, VEB Kombinat Robotron Dresden assembled these components into a range of computers. VEB Kombinat Rundfunk- und Fernsehtechnik Staßfurt produced consumer electronics such as radio receivers, cassette decks, and television sets while telecommunications equipment was provided by VEB Kombinat Nachrichtenelektronik Berlin. With the exception of Carl Zeiss and Robotron, most components and devices were sold under the common trademark RFT (from  Rundfunk- und Fernmelde-Technik).[de]

History
From 1977 the attempt to achieve a competitive edge in microchips against the research and development resources of the entire western world – in a state of just 16 million people – was perhaps always doomed to failure, but swallowed increasing amounts of internal resources and hard currency. GDR was some five to eight years behind the leading producers of USA and Japan. To produce one 64kb chip cost 40 marks, while in the West it cost 4.50 marks. To produce one 256kb chip cost 534 marks, while in the West it cost 5.00 to 7.00 marks.
Microelectronics industry in Eastern Germany began in 1961 when the ""Arbeitsstelle für Molekularelektronik Dresden"" (department of molecular electronics Dresden) was established in Dresden. Later it grew into ""VEB Forschungszentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden"".
The center of East German microchip industry was in Dresden, where research and production laboratories were located. Production equipment was built by Carl Zeiss Jena and ""VEB Elektromat Dresden"". The actual 13 mm x 5 mm U61000 microchip production was done by ""VEB Forschungszentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden"" and it was presented publicly in September 1988. In total some 50,000 U61000 microchips were produced  in early 1990 before the GDR dissolved together with its microchip industry. 
During the Cold War 3,500 people were employed in this microelectronics center.
After reunification Dresden formed the nucleus for the modern day largest unified German cluster in semiconductor technologies; Silicon Saxony, with 40,000 employees.

Lacrosse,"Lacrosse is a contact team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball. It is the oldest organized sport in North America, with its origins with the indigenous people of North America as early as the 12th century. The game was extensively modified by European colonists, reducing the violence, to create its current collegiate and professional form.
Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has five versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse, lacrosse sixes and intercrosse. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact. The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Lacrosse sixes is played by both men and women on a smaller field and is the most common version at multi-sport events. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.
The modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations. The organization hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men, the Women's Lacrosse World Cup, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, and the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships for both men and women. Each is held every four years. Lacrosse at the Summer Olympics has been contested at two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, 1904 and 1908. It will be contested at the 2028 Olympic Games in the lacrosse sixes format. It was also held as a demonstration event at the 1928, 1932, and 1948 Summer Olympics.

History
Lacrosse is based on games played by various Native American communities as early as 1100 AD. By the 17th century, a version of lacrosse was well-established and was documented by Jesuit missionary priests in the territory of present-day Canada.
In the traditional aboriginal Canadian version, each team consisted of about 100 to 1,000 men on a field several miles/kilometers long. These games lasted from sunup to sundown for two to three days straight and were played as part of ceremonial ritual, a kind of symbolic warfare, or to give thanks to the Creator or Master.
Lacrosse played a significant role in the community and religious life of tribes across the continent for many years. Early lacrosse was characterized by deep spiritual involvement, befitting the spirit of combat in which it was undertaken. Those who took part did so in the role of warriors, with the goal of bringing glory and honour to themselves and their tribes. The game was said to be played ""for the Creator"" or was referred to as ""The Creator's Game"", and a version o",sports
Artificial heart,"An artificial heart is a device that replaces the heart. Artificial hearts are typically used as a bridge to heart transplantation, but ongoing research aims to develop a device that could permanently replace the heart when a transplant—whether from a deceased human or, experimentally, from a genetically engineered pig—is unavailable or not viable. As of December 2023, there are two commercially available full artificial heart devices; both are intended for temporary use (less than a year) for patients with total heart failure who are awaiting a human heart transplant.
Although other similar inventions preceded it from the late 1940s, the first artificial heart to be successfully implanted in a human was the Jarvik-7 in 1982, designed by a team including Willem Johan Kolff, William DeVries  and Robert Jarvik.
An artificial heart is distinct from a ventricular assist device (VAD; for either one or both of the ventricles, the heart's lower chambers), which may also be a permanent solution, or the intra-aortic balloon pump – both devices are designed to support a failing heart. It is also distinct from a cardiopulmonary bypass machine, which is an external device used to provide the functions of both the heart and lungs, used only for a few hours at a time, most commonly during cardiac surgery. It is also distinct from a ventilator, used to support failing lungs, or the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is used to support those with both inadequate heart and lung function for up to days or weeks, unlike the bypass machine.

History
Origins
A synthetic replacement for a heart remains a long-sought ""holy grail"" of modern medicine. The obvious benefit of a functional artificial heart would be to lower the need for heart transplants as the demand for organs always greatly exceeds supply.
Although the heart is conceptually a pump, it embodies subtleties that defy straightforward emulation with synthetic materials and power supplies. Artificial hearts have historically had issues from both a biomedical standpoint, regarding clotting and foreign object rejection, as well as longevity and practicality, regarding the lifespan of the device as well as the equipment required to run it.
Since the inception of the device, artificial hearts have been continually improved as medical technology has. More recent devices, such as the Carmat heart, have sought to improve upon their predecessors by reducing complications resultant from device implant, such as foreign-body rejection and thrombus.

Early development
The first artificial heart was made by the Soviet scientist Vladimir Demikhov in 1938. It was implanted in a dog.
On 2 July 1952, 41-year-old Henry Opitek, suffering from shortness of breath, made medical history at Harper University Hospital at Wayne State University in Michigan. The Dodrill-GMR heart machine, considered to be the first operational mechanical heart, was successfully used while performing heart surgery.

Household plot,"Household plot is a legally defined farm type in all former socialist countries in CIS and CEE. This is a small plot of land (typically less than 0.5 ha (1.2 acres)) attached to a rural residence. The household plot is primarily cultivated for subsistence and its traditional purpose since the Soviet times has been to provide the family with food. Surplus products from the household plot are sold to neighbors, relatives, and often also in farmer markets in nearby towns. The household plot was the only form of private or family farming allowed during the Soviet era, when household plots of rural people coexisted in a symbiotic relationship with large collective and state farms. Since 1990, the household plots are classified as one of the two components of the individual farm sector, the other being peasant farms – independent family farms established for commercial production on much larger areas of agricultural land, typically 10 to 50 ha (25 to 124 acres). In terms of legal organization, household plots are natural (physical) persons, whereas peasant farms generally are legal (juridical) persons.

Names
Household plots are called in Russian subsidiary (or auxiliary) household plots – личные подсобные хозяйства, abbreviated in writing and in speech as ЛПХ (transliteration: LPKh). They are also often referred to (especially in official statistical publications) as хозяйства населения (Ukrainian: господарства населення), i.e., plots (or farms) of rural residents (where the term “rural residents” is used to distinguish them from peasant farmers). This Russian terminology was universally accepted in all former Soviet countries until the early 1990s, but a certain terminological divergence has since emerged in the newly independent states. For instance, in Uzbekistan the traditional household plots are now called dehkan farms and in Ukraine the Russian abbreviation ЛПХ has been replaced with OСГ (from Ukrainian: osobysti selyanski hospodarstva).

History
In Czarist Russia, the plot (usad'ba) was usually adjacent to the peasant's house.  Here the peasants traditionally grew vegetables, hemp (a source of oil and livestock feed) and a little fruit.  Gardens varied in size; they could be as much as one hectare (2+1⁄2 acres), but most were smaller.  The plot was normally in the hereditary tenure of the household, and not subject to repartition (unlike the peasants' holdings in the open fields).
In the later 19th century the growth of towns and cities in central Russia encouraged the development of market gardening and truck farming in this region.  By the eve of the Revolution the garden economy was developing quickly.  A further stimulus was provided in the first years of the Revolution by the Bolshevik policy of requisitioning peasant produce.  Fruit and vegetables were exempt from this policy, and this resulted in a strong swing from grain farming to kitchen and market gardening.  In the grain-producing regions (Black-Earth belt and North Caucasia) the g",economics
Science and technology studies,"Science and technology studies (STS) or science, technology, and society is an interdisciplinary field that examines the creation, development, and consequences of science and technology in their historical, cultural, and social contexts.

History
Like most interdisciplinary fields of study, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.  The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although Ludwik Fleck's (1935) monograph Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact anticipated many of STS's key themes. In the 1970s Elting E. Morison founded the STS program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centers and academic programs were counted worldwide.

Important key points
History of technology, that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned technological determinism, a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific ""natural"" development. At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the history of medicine.
History and philosophy of science (1960s). After the publication of Thomas Kuhn's well-known The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual paradigms, programs were founded at the University of California, Berkeley and elsewhere that brought historians of science and philosophers together in unified programs.
Science, technology, and society. In the mid-to-late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as women's studies) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of ""science, technology, and society"" programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, history, political science, and sociology, scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by science and technology. Feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of women from science and engineering, focusing instead on critiquing gendered power dynamics in prior STS research.
Science, engineering, and public policy studies emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement: A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public's best interests. The science, techno",science
Nine-a-side footy,"Nine-a-side football is a sport based on Australian rules football played informally by Aussie rules clubs but not yet an official sport in its own right.
9-a-side games are sometimes played on half size fields that are typically rectangular or more commonly rugby or soccer fields, with 9 players on the field at any one time, typically consisting of 3 forwards, 3 backs and 3 centre players.  Often two games are played at the same time on a single Australian Rules or cricket pitch.  Other times, 9-a-side makes use of the full space of the field when a full complement of players is not available.  This variety is a more open, running variety of Australian rules.

Rules
The following rules apply in 9-a-side football as played by Aussie Rules UK:

Up to 9 players on each team, with 3 players each designated as forwards, centres and backs
After each goal the players must be in their respective third of the pitch but may rove freely after the ball-up
Goals and behinds may only be scored from within the forward zone
Players may bounce the ball only once before disposing of it
If the ball goes out of play (whether on the full or not) the nearest opponent shall kick the ball back into play
All other rules remain unchanged.   www.9asidefootball.com

Advantages
Australian Rules football has struggled to develop outside Australia partly because the game is highly resource intensive. A game requires the use of a large cricket oval, many players (40 including interchanges) and several officials. The adaptation of the game to rugby fields requires far fewer players and a pitch that is more readily available, and as a result, many more people are being introduced to the game outside Australia.

Competitions
Examples of official tournaments held under these rules include:

The EU Cup
European leagues: Australian Rules Football League of Ireland, Scottish Australian Rules Football League, Welsh Australian Rules Football League
Haggis Cup
Bali Nines
Aussie Rules UK National League and India

Existing formats
AFL 9s, sanctioned by the Australian Football League is the non-contact game replacing the earlier Rec Footy.
Touch Aussie Rules, sanctioned by Aussie Rules UK is the non-contact game played in the UK.
Metro Footy is a 9-a-side game played on gridiron fields in the United States.

Wheelchair Australian rules football,"The first organised game of competitive wheelchair Australian rules football was played at the RAAF base in Adelaide, South Australia on 8 November 2015. The game involved a team of wounded Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel undergoing rehabilitation at Darwin's soldier Recovery Centre  and a Disability Sports Australia (DSA) team made up of players from South Australia. The game was organized by the ADF, Australian Football League and DSA. The final score was: DSA team 16.8.104 defeated the ADF team 14.5.89.
In April 2015, Prince Harry whilst visiting Darwin, Northern Territory raised the profile of this new sport by participating in a game of wheelchair AFL. The game involved wounded Australian soldiers.
In November 2015, there were plans to create a national league.

Rules
Rules of the game have some similarity to AFL rules for Australian rules football and include:

Game is started by throwing up the ball in the centre of the field.
Six points for a goal, and one point for a behind.
Kicks are replaced with handballs, and handballs replaced with underarm throws.
A red Sherrin football is used, with the game split into four quarters.
Game is played on a basketball court with plastic posts at each end of the court.
Only five players from each team can be on the field at any given time.
Team is divided in backs, centres and forwards but only forwards  can score.

Mathematics,"Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories and theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself. There are many areas of mathematics, which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics).
Mathematics involves the description and manipulation of abstract objects that consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—purely abstract entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms.  Mathematics uses pure reason to prove properties of objects, a proof consisting of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results. These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration.
Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science, and the social sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent of any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics) but often later find practical applications.
Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since its beginning, mathematics was primarily divided into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new fields. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a correlated increase in the development of both. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics.

Areas of mathematics
Before the Renaissance, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic, regarding the manipulation of numbers, and geometry, regarding the study of shapes. Some types of pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, were not then clearly distinguished from mathematics.
During the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly speaking, consists of the",science
Beach rugby,"Beach rugby is a sport that is based on rugby union. Currently there is not a centralized regulation of the sport as in beach soccer or beach volleyball, but leagues are common across Europe. The sport is particularly popular in Italy, in the Balkan region and in Eastern Europe. Casual games are played around the world using different sets of rules. However, organized leagues use a field that is only a fraction of the size of a standard rugby field, far fewer players on each team, shorter matches, and a simplified scoring system. Two popular tournaments in the United States are the 7s By The Sea tournament, held in Corpus Christi, Texas each summer, and The Beerfoot 7s tournament, played in Fort Myers Beach, Florida on the last weekend of July. 
The inaugural European Beach Five Rugby Championships was held in Moscow in 2017 and is being held there since then.

Rules
In Beach rugby, rucks, mauls, scrums, gang tackles, kicks above waist heights, lineouts are outlawed.

Field dimensions
The size of a beach rugby field depends on the decision of the league. The field is between 30 and 50 metres long and 20–35 metres wide, and the in-goals are 3–7 metres deep. There are no goalposts on the field, and the lines are usually marked with some sort of tape or rope.

Number of players
Depending on the league and the field size, either 4 or 7 players are allowed on the field for one team at once. Between 3 and 7 reserves are allowed, again, depending on the league. Substitutions are often done ""on-the-fly,"" similar to ice hockey or futsal.

The ball
A standard rugby ball is used, but many leagues will use a size 4 ball instead of size 5, the size used in all levels of field rugby above youth. A rugby ball is oval-shaped and made of synthetic leather panels that have small dimples to enhance handling.

Scoring
Most leagues use a ""one try, one point"" scoring system, since there are no goalposts on the field. Occasionally, a sudden-death extra time period is used to resolve matches drawn at the end of regulation, but not all leagues use this rule.
One Italian league used a system where the in-goals were divided into five equal rectangles. A try scored from the outer rectangles was worth 3 points, from the central rectangle was 5 points, and from either of the two intermediate rectangles was worth 4 points. However, there is no evidence that this league still exists. The Ameland Beach Rugby Festival www.beachrugby.nl(The Netherlands) also uses this system.

Timing
Leagues use either two 5 or 7 minute halves (with a 1 or 3 minute interval for halftime) as the length of a single match. Extra time may be played if the league in question calls for it.

Clinical handover,"Clinical handover (patient handover or handover) is the transfer of professional responsibility and accountability for some or all aspects of care for a patient, or group of patients, to another person or professional group on a temporary or permanent basis. 

When critical clinical information emerges or there is a risk to patient care, timely communication of this information to the appropriate person(s) is essential to ensuring patient safety and delivery of the right care. Failure in handover is a major source in preventable patient harm. Clinical handover is an international concern and Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries have developed risk reduction recommendations. 
It is important to define and agree on the minimum information content for clinical handovers relevant to a service or discipline. It may be helpful to consider what clinical and non-clinical information is time critical or significant to patient care, such as:

New critical diagnostic or test results that require a change to care
Changes in a patient’s physical and psychological condition, including unexpected deterioration or development of complications
Follow-up communication following a review of results.
Use of structured handover tools can help to provide a framework for communicating the minimum information content for clinical handovers. This may be supported by electronic clinical handover templates. 
Examples of clinical handover tools to help structure handover:

ISBAR (Identify, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation)
SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation)
SHARED (Situation, History, Assessment, Risk, Expectation, Documentation)
I PASS the BATON (Introduction, Patient, Assessment, Situation, Safety concerns, Background, Actions, Timing, Ownership, Next).

Economic anthropology,"Economic anthropology is a field that attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It is an amalgamation of economics and anthropology. It is practiced by anthropologists and has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology began with work by the Polish founder of anthropology Bronislaw Malinowski and the French Marcel Mauss on the nature of reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange. In an earlier German context, Heinrich Schurtz has been cited as a “founder of economic anthropology"" for his pioneering inquiries into money and exchange across different cultural settings.
Post-World War II, economic anthropology was highly influenced by the work of economic historian Karl Polanyi. Polanyi drew on anthropological studies to argue that true market exchange was limited to a restricted number of western, industrial societies. Applying formal economic theory (Formalism) to non-industrial societies was mistaken, he argued. In non-industrial societies, exchange was ""embedded"" in such non-market institutions as kinship, religion, and politics (an idea he borrowed from Mauss). He labelled this approach Substantivism. The formalist–substantivist debate was highly influential and defined an era.
As globalization became a reality, and the division between market and non-market economies – between ""the West and the Rest"" – became untenable, anthropologists began to look at the relationship between a variety of types of exchange within market societies. Neo-substantivists examine the ways in which so-called pure market exchange in market societies fails to fit market ideology. Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists. They now study the operations of corporations, banks, and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective.

Reciprocity and the gift
Malinowski and Mauss: Debate over the Kula exchange
Bronislaw Malinowski's groundbreaking work, Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922), posits the question, ""why would men risk life and limb to travel across huge expanses of dangerous ocean to give away what appear to be worthless trinkets?""  Carefully traced the network of exchanges of bracelets and necklaces across the Trobriand Islands, Malinowski established that they were part of a system of exchange, the Kula ring. He stated that this exchange system was clearly linked to political authority.
In the 1920s and later, Malinowski's research became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of The Gift (Essai sur le don, 1925). Contrasting Mauss, Malinowski emphasised the exchange of goods between individuals, and their non-altruistic motives for giving: they expected a return of equal or greater value. In other words, reciprocity is an implicit part of gifting; no ""free gift"" is given without expectation of recipr",economics
CAVE people,"NIMBY (, or nimby), an acronym for the phrase ""not in my back yard"", is a characterization of opposition by residents to proposed real estate development and infrastructure developments in their local area, as well as support for strict land use regulations. It carries the connotation that such residents are only opposing the development because it is close to them and that they would tolerate or support it if it were built farther away. The residents are often called nimbys, and their viewpoint is called nimbyism. The opposite movement is known as YIMBY for ""yes in my back yard"".
Some examples of projects that have been opposed by nimbys include housing development (especially for affordable housing or trailer parks), high-speed rail lines, homeless shelters, day cares, schools, universities and colleges, bike lanes and transportation planning that promotes pedestrian safety infrastructure, solar farms, wind farms, incinerators, sewage treatment systems, fracking, and nuclear waste repositories.

Rationale
Developments likely to attract local objections include:

Infrastructure development, such as new roads and rest areas, railway, light rail and metro lines, airports, power plants, retail developments, sales of public assets, electrical transmission lines, wastewater treatment plants, landfills, sewage outfalls and prisons;
Waste facility development, e.g. exploration of disposal sites for nuclear/radiation waste;
The extraction of mineral resources including ore, aggregates and hydrocarbons from mines, quarries and oil wells or gas wells, respectively;
Renewable energy generators, such as wind farms and solar panels;
Businesses trading in goods perceived as immoral, such as adult video, liquor stores, and cannabis dispensaries;
Accommodations perceived as primarily benefiting disadvantaged people, such as subsidized housing for the financially disadvantaged, supportive housing for the mentally ill, congregate living care homes (as for the developmentally disabled), halfway houses for drug addicts and criminals, and homeless shelters.
Services catering to certain stigmatized groups (for example, injection drug users), such as methadone clinics, syringe exchange programmes, drug detoxification facilities, supervised injection site;
Large-scale developments of all kinds, such as big-box stores and housing subdivisions.
The claimed reasons against these developments vary, and some are given below.

Increased traffic: more jobs, more housing or more stores correlates to increased traffic on local streets and greater demand for parking spots. Industrial facilities such as warehouses, factories, or landfills often increase the volume of truck traffic.
Harm to locally owned small businesses: the development of a big box store may provide too much competition to a locally owned store; similarly, the construction of a new road may make the older road less traveled, leading to a loss of business for property owners. This can lead to excessive relocation",politics
Samoa rules,"Samoa rules is a game derived from Australian rules football and rugby union that is occasionally played in Samoa.

Rules
Generally the rules are taken from Australian rules, but each team consists of 15 players, like rugby union.
Unlike Australian rules football, player movement is restricted to zones (similarly to rec footy).  There is a line across the centre that backs and forwards can not cross. Onballers are allowed to go anywhere. Forwards can only operate in their attacking half, the backs in their defensive half. Like Gaelic football, players are permitted to bounce the ball only once while running, in order to encourage kicking.

Pitch
The game is played on rugby union fields, sometimes a single one, or two side by side. This means the pitch is rectangular, rather than oval, like an Australian football field.

History
The Vailima Six-Shooters' Championship began in Samoa in 1998 under these rules, becoming known as Samoa rules.  A number of Samoa rules players went on to represent Samoa in the Samoan national Australian rules football team.

Einsiedeln Abbey,"Einsiedeln Abbey (German: Kloster Einsiedeln) is a Catholic monastery administered by the Benedictine Order in the village of Einsiedeln, Switzerland.
The Abbey of Einsiedeln is one of the most important baroque monastic sites and the largest place of pilgrimage in Switzerland.
The Black Madonna of Einsiedeln in the Chapel of Grace attracts around 800,000 pilgrims and tourists every year. The community of Benedictine monks has around 40 members. The monastery is not under the jurisdiction of a diocese or a bishop because it is a territorial abbey.
The abbey operates a private high school along with a winery, sawmill, restaurant and other small businesses in order to support itself.

History
Origin of the monastery
The history of Einsiedeln Abbey starts with Meinrad of Einsiedeln. Born in 797 in Sulchen, he was educated at the abbey school on Reichenau Island in what is today Germany.  Meinrad became a monk and was later ordained a priest. After gaining public attention for reportedly performing miracles, Meinrad established a hermitage in 828 in the Einsiedeln forest of Switzerland, searching for privacy.  He was murdered by two robbers in January 861.
Over the next 80 years, other hermits occupied Meinrad's hermitage. In 934 Eberhard, previously Provost of Strassburg, built the Einsiedeln abbey and church on the hermitage site, becoming its first abbot.  According to legend, the church was consecrated in 948 in person by Jesus Christ in honor of his mother Mary. It was the beginning of the pilgrimage to the Chapel of the Saviour, which turned in the Middle Ages to a Marian pilgrimage.
In 965 Gregory, the third Abbot of Einsiedeln, was named a prince of the Holy Roman Empire by Emperor Otto I.  His successor abbots would hold that title until the dissolution of the empire in 1806.

High and late Middle Ages
In 1226, after another fire, the church was enlarged. The lower church was built above the Chapel of the Saviour, which was incorporated into the new complex. This effect, of a sanctuary within a sanctuary, has been maintained in later restorations of the Chapel of Our Lady.
In the 13th century, the pilgrimage to the monastic compley became more popular, better structured and organized. The figure of the enthroned Madonna holding the baby Christ on her left knee, which appears on an abbey seal from 1239, is considered Einsiedeln's oldest miraculous image.

Early modern times
During the early 16th century, the standards of discipline at Einsiedeln started to decline, but Ludovicus II, a monk of St. Gall who was Abbot of Einsiedeln from 1526 to 1544, restored a stricter observance. The abbey remained unaffected by the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland. Its leader, Huldrych Zwingli, had studied at the abbey for a period of time. Abbot Augustine I (1600–29) led the movement to create the Swiss Congregation of the Order of St. Benedict in 1602. Augustine established unrelaxed observance in the abbey and promoted a high standard of scholarship a",history

Modern era,"The modern era or the modern period is considered the current historical period of human history. It was originally applied to the history of Europe and Western history for events that came after the Middle Ages, often from around the year 1500, like the Reformation in Germany giving rise to Protestantism. From the 1990s, it is more common among historians to refer to the period after the Middle Ages and up to the 19th century as the early modern period. The modern period is today more often used for events from the 19th century until today. The time from the end of World War II (1945) can also be described as being part of contemporary history.
The common definition of the modern period today is often associated with events like the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the transition to nationalism toward the liberal international order.
The modern period has been a period of significant development in the fields of science, politics, warfare, and technology. It has also been an Age of Discovery and globalization. During this time, the European powers and later their colonies, strengthened its political, economic, and cultural colonization of the rest of the world. It also created a new modern lifestyle and has permanently changed the way people around the world live. 
In the  19th and early 20th century, modernist art, politics, science, and culture have come to dominate not only Western Europe and North America, but almost every area on the globe, including movements thought of as opposed to the western world and globalization. The modern era is closely associated with the development of individualism, capitalism, urbanization, and a belief in the positive possibilities of technological and political progress.
The brutal wars and other conflicts of this era, many of which come from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against modern development. Optimism and the belief in constant progress have been most recently criticized by postmodernism, while the dominance of Western Europe and North America over the rest of the world has been criticized by postcolonial theory.

Terminology
Eras cannot easily be defined for periodization. 1500 is an approximate starting period for the modern era because many major events caused the Western world to change around that time: from the fall of Constantinople (1453), Gutenberg's moveable type printing press (1450s), completion of the Reconquista (1492 in Spain) and Christopher Columbus's voyage to the Americas (also 1492), to the Reformation begun with Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses (1517).
The term ""modern"" was coined shortly before 1585 to describe the beginning of a new era.
The term ""early modern"" was introduced in the English language by American historians at the turn of the 20th century (around 1900). It was long thought that the concept was invented either in the 1930s to distinguish the t",history
Chinese era name,"Chinese era names, also known as reign mottos, were titles used by various Chinese dynasties and regimes in Imperial China for the purpose of year identification and numbering. The first monarch to adopt era names was the Emperor Wu of Han in 140 BCE, and this system remained the official method of year identification and numbering until the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912 CE, when the era name system was superseded by the Republic of China calendar. Other polities in the Sinosphere—Korea, Vietnam and Japan—also adopted the concept of era name as a result of Chinese politico-cultural influence.

Description
Chinese era names were titles adopted for the purpose of identifying and numbering years in Imperial China. Era names originated as mottos or slogans chosen by the reigning monarch and usually reflected the political, economic and/or social landscapes at the time. For instance, the first era name proclaimed by the Emperor Wu of Han, Jianyuan (建元; lit. ""establishing the origin""), was reflective of its status as the first era name. Similarly, the era name Jianzhongjingguo (建中靖國; lit. ""establishing a moderate and peaceful country"") used by the Emperor Huizong of Song was indicative of Huizong's idealism towards moderating the rivalry among the conservative and progressive factions regarding political and social reforms.
The process of declaring an era name was referred to in traditional Chinese historical texts as jiànyuán (建元). Proclaiming a new era name to replace an existing era name was known as gǎiyuán (改元; lit. ""change the origin""). Instituting a new era name would reset the numbering of the year back to year one, known as yuán nián (元年; lit. ""year of origin""). On the first day of the Chinese calendar, the numbering of the year would increase by one. To name a year using an era name only requires counting years from the first year of the era. For example, 609 CE was the fifth year of Daye (大業; lit. ""great endeavour""), as the era began in 605 CE; traditional Chinese sources would therefore refer to 609 CE as Dàyè wǔ nián (大業五年).
The numbering of the year would still increase on the first day of the Chinese calendar each year, regardless of the month in which the era name was adopted. For example, as the Emperor Daizong of Tang replaced the era name Yongtai (永泰; lit. ""perpetual peace"") with Dali (大曆; lit. ""great era"") in the eleventh month of the Chinese calendar in 766 CE, the first year of Dali thus only consisted of the last two months of that particular year; the second year of Dali began on the first day of the Chinese calendar the following year, just two months after its initiation.
When a new monarch ascended to the throne, he could either declare a new era immediately or inherit the usage of the existing era name from his predecessor. For example, the era name Wutai (武泰; lit. ""exalted martial"") of the Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei was immediately replaced with Jianyi (建義; lit. ""establishing justice"") when the Empero",history

Atomic Age,"The Atomic Age, also known as the Atomic Era, is the period of history following the detonation of the first nuclear weapon, The Gadget at the Trinity test in New Mexico on 16 July 1945 during World War II. Although nuclear chain reactions had been hypothesized in 1933 and the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction (Chicago Pile-1) had taken place in December 1942, the Trinity test and the ensuing bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that ended World War II represented the first large-scale use of nuclear technology and ushered in profound changes in sociopolitical thinking and the course of technological development.
While atomic power was promoted for a time as the epitome of progress and modernity, entering into the nuclear power era also entailed frightful implications of nuclear warfare, the Cold War, mutual assured destruction, nuclear proliferation, the risk of nuclear disaster (potentially as extreme as anthropogenic global nuclear winter), as well as beneficial civilian applications in nuclear medicine. It is no easy matter to fully segregate peaceful uses of nuclear technology from military or terrorist uses (such as the fabrication of dirty bombs from radioactive waste), which complicated the development of a global nuclear-power export industry right from the outset.
In 1973, concerning a flourishing nuclear power industry, the United States Atomic Energy Commission predicted that by the turn of the 21st century, 1,000 reactors would be producing electricity for homes and businesses across the U.S. However, the ""nuclear dream"" fell far short of what was promised because nuclear technology produced a range of social problems, from the nuclear arms race to nuclear meltdowns, and the unresolved difficulties of bomb plant cleanup and civilian plant waste disposal and decommissioning. Since 1973, reactor orders declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose. Many orders and partially completed plants were cancelled.
By the late 1970s, nuclear power had suffered a remarkable international destabilization, as it was faced with economic difficulties and widespread public opposition, coming to a head with the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, both of which adversely affected the nuclear power industry for many decades.

Early years
In 1901, Frederick Soddy and Ernest Rutherford discovered that radioactivity was part of the process by which atoms changed from one kind to another, involving the release of energy. Soddy wrote in popular magazines that radioactivity was a potentially ""inexhaustible"" source of energy and offered a vision of an atomic future where it would be possible to ""transform a desert continent, thaw the frozen poles, and make the whole earth one smiling Garden of Eden."" The promise of an ""atomic age,"" with nuclear energy as the global, utopian technology for the satisfaction of human needs, has been a recurring theme ever since. But ""Soddy also saw t",history

Gründerzeit,"Gründerzeit (German pronunciation: [ˈɡʁʏndɐˌtsaɪt] ; lit. 'founders' period') refers to an economic phase in 19th century Germany and Austria before the great stock market crash of 1873, or, in a more precise definition, the two years following the founding of the German Empire in 1871 (also called the Gründerjahre, or ""founder's years""). However, the definition of Gründerzeit has retroactively been expanded to include the years of the Long Depression, despite its slowed economic growth, and to the prosperous years between 1896 and the beginning of World War I.  
The term also refers to a cultural and architectural era which began in 1870 and lasted until 1914. Gründerzeit architecture is closely associated with historicism, and occupies a prominent place in many Central European cities.

Economy
The so-called Gründerzeit or age of the founders lasted for just six years, from 1867 to 1873. The term refers to a short-lived economic boom and the economic rise of the German Empire, when hundreds of new businesses, banks and railways were founded. German writers of the late 19th century used the term Gründerzeit as a pejorative, because the cultural output of that movement is associated with materialism and nationalistic triumphalism. Cultural historian Egon Friedell complained that fraud in the stock market had not been the only swindle of the Gründerzeit.

Design and architecture
The need for housing rose in consequence of industrialization. Complete housing developments in the so-called Founding Era's Architecture style arose in previously green fields, and even today, Central European cities have many buildings from the time together along a single road or even in complete districts. The buildings have four to six stories and were often built by private property developers. They often sported richly-decorated façades in the form of Historicism such as Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, German Renaissance and Baroque Revival. Magnificent palaces for nouveau-riche citizens but also infamous rental housing for the expanding urban lower classes were built.
The period was also important for the integration of new technologies in architecture and design. A determining factor was the development of the Bessemer process in steel production, which made possible the construction of steel façades. A classical example of the new form is the steel and glass construction of the Crystal Palace, completed in 1851, which was then revolutionary and inspired subsequent decades.
Gründerzeit districts, called Gründerzeitviertel, were built all over Germany, Austria and even in Hungary.

	Examples of Gründerzeit districts

In Austria
In Austria, the Gründerzeit began after 1840 with the industrialisation of Vienna, as well as the regions of Bohemia and Moravia. Liberalism reached its zenith in Austria in 1867 in Austria-Hungary and remained dominant until the mid-1870s.

""Quadriga"" is the name inspired by Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker for the new Greek project and creditors have now added the ESM to their collective and rebranded themselves ""The Quadriga.""
While talking about the quadriga (especially in the media) one refers to a decision group formed by the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the newly added European Stability Mechanism (ESM).

Auskick,"Auskick is a program designed to teach the basic skills of Australian football to children aged between 5 and 12. Auskick is a non-contact variant of the sport. It began in Australia and is now a nationwide non-selective program. It has increased participation and diversity in the sport amongst children, and is now being run in many countries across the world.
At its peak in the mid-1990s in Australia there were around 200,000 Auskick participants annually and this figure has since stabilised at this number. Numerous professional, semi-professional and representative players are graduates.
The program is now run throughout the world, including several locally branded variations such as: ""Kiwi Kick"" (AFL New Zealand), ""Niukick"" (Papua New Guinea), ""Footywild"" (South Africa), ""Bula Kick"" (Fiji), ""Viking Kick"" (Denmark), ""Ausball"" (United States) and ""Pikinini Kick"" (Vanuatu) among others often sponsored by local organisations.

History
Auskick has its roots in the Little League which began to be played at half time during VFL (now AFL) matches in the 1960s and was revised in 1980 to make it more accessible. Little League was expanded by Ray Allsop into a state development program called ""Vickick"" begun in Victoria in 1985. Participation increased from 7,000 to 35,000 in 4 years.
The ACT was one of the first other states or territories to introduce the program in 1991 as ""Auskick"". Between 1993 and 1995 former AFL player and coach David Parkin who had been coaching the territory's Teal Cup side successfully lobbied the AFL for the national adoption of Auskick.
In 1998, the AFL Commission, the national governing body for the sport, began to roll it out nationally. At its peak there were around 200,000 Auskick participants annually. As the world governing body, the Commission later franchised the program to affiliated organisations around the world under various local brands and sponsors.

Auskick sessions
Auskick is a national football coaching network, with clinics held weekly (usually on Saturday mornings) run by volunteers. The program attracts over 100,000 primary school aged participants annually and, as such, is the largest grassroots sporting association of its kind in Australia.
Each Auskick session consists of a training session and a game, with the emphasis on developing skills rather than the game result. Some of the major rule differences from Australian rules football are a ban on tackling and the restriction of players to their zone of the field, similar to netball.
The AFL is a major supporter of Auskick and star players occasionally assist in training events. The AFL also invites various branches of the Auskick network to play short games during the half-time breaks of premiership season games at all grounds, with numerous matches played on modified fields simultaneously.
In 2007 the program's slogan was ""Where Champions Begin"", with Jo Silvagni (wife of  former AFL player Stephen Silvagni) and Robert DiPierdomenico, the 1986 co-Brown",sports
Nova Milano,"Nova Milano is a historic site and the seat of the fourth district of the Brazilian municipality of Farroupilha, considered the birthplace of Italian colonization in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Originally the headquarters of the Caxias Colony, a pavilion was set up there in 1875 to welcome the immigrants who were waiting to be placed in the colonies in the region. In 1876 the colonial headquarters was transferred to Campo dos Bugres, but Nova Milano, on the margins of a very busy road, became a village, and in 1902 became the headquarters of the third district of Caxias. The arrival of railroads in 1910 determined a reorganization in the road and economic structure of the region, harming the growth of Nova Milano, which in 1934 was incorporated to the new municipality of Farroupilha as its fourth district, remaining until today with mainly rural characteristics.
In 1975 the governments of Italy and Rio Grande do Sul organized a large series of festivities and events to commemorate the 100 years of Italian colonization in the state. In Nova Milano, the Italian Immigration Park was built, with a monument, a museum and several memorials about the immigration, besides recreational spaces. The district preserves several historical buildings and has tourist potential.

Location
About 100 km from the capital Porto Alegre and 8 km from the center of Farroupilha, Nova Milano is on the margins of the RS-122 highway, which connects Porto Alegre to the Serra Gaúcha region. It is bordered by the municipality of Carlos Barbosa to the southwest, by the Sesmaria Machado dividing line. It is bordered by the municipality of Alto Feliz to the south, having limits on the old Júlio de Castilhos Road. It is bounded by the municipality of Vale Real to the southeast, after Caravaggieto in the access to Forqueta Baixa. It is bordered by the municipality of Caxias do Sul to the east.

History
The history of Nova Milano began in 1870, when the land demarcation commission sent by the imperial government to draw the limits of the new Caxias Colony camped there, part of an ambitious project of the imperial government to populate the mountainous region of the state with free workers, who would be settled in single-family lots, where they were to live as farmers and artisans. The government intended to improve the domestic supply of basic products and colonize the population with European immigrants. The applicants received government assistance for settlement. Two other colonies were demarcated at the time: Conde d'Eu and Dona Isabel, but the administration of the project was tumultuous and not very efficient, and the first immigrants faced a series of difficulties when arriving in Rio Grande do Sul.

Computational linguistics,"Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the computational modelling of natural language, as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions. In general, computational linguistics draws upon linguistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, logic, philosophy, cognitive science, cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, anthropology and neuroscience, among others.

Origins
The field overlapped with artificial intelligence since the efforts in the United States in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages, particularly Russian scientific journals, into English. Since rule-based approaches were able to make arithmetic (systematic) calculations much faster and more accurately than humans, it was expected that lexicon, morphology, syntax and semantics can be learned using explicit rules, as well. After the failure of rule-based approaches, David Hays coined the term in order to distinguish the field from AI and co-founded both the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL) in the 1970s and 1980s. What started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into a much wider field of natural language processing.

Annotated corpora
In order to be able to meticulously study the English language, an annotated text corpus was much  needed. The Penn Treebank was one of the most used corpora. It consisted of IBM computer manuals, transcribed telephone conversations, and other texts, together containing over 4.5 million words of American English, annotated using both  part-of-speech tagging and syntactic bracketing.
Japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of log-normality was found in relation to sentence length.

Modeling language acquisition
The fact that during language acquisition, children are largely only exposed to positive evidence, meaning that the only evidence for what is a correct form is provided, and no evidence for what is not correct, was a limitation for the models at the time because the now available deep learning models were not available in late 1980s.
It has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span, which explained the long period of language acquisition in human infants and children.
Robots have been used to test linguistic theories. Enabled to learn as children might, models were created based on an affordance model in which mappings between actions, perceptions, and effects were created and linked to spoken words. Crucially, these robots were able to acquire functioning word-to-meaning mappings without needing grammatical structure.
Using the Price equation and Pólya urn dynamics, researchers have created a system which not only predicts future linguistic evolution but also gives insight into the evolution",science

Consensus government,"Consensus democracy is the application of consensus decision-making and supermajority to the process of legislation in a democracy. It is characterized by a decision-making structure that involves and takes into account as broad a range of opinions as possible, as opposed to majoritarian democracy systems where minority opinions can potentially be ignored by vote-winning majorities. Constitutions typically require consensus or supermajority.
A consensus government is a national unity government with representation across the whole political spectrum. A concordance democracy is a type of consensus democracy where majority rule does not play a central role. Optional referendums and popular initiatives correspond to consensus democracy.

Examples
Consensus democracy is most closely embodied in certain countries such as Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Lebanon, Sweden, Iraq, and Belgium, where consensus is an important feature of political culture, particularly with a view to preventing the domination of one linguistic or cultural group in the political process. The term consociational state is used in political science to describe countries with such consensus based political systems. An example of such a system could be the Dutch Poldermodel.
Many parties in Lebanon call for applying consensus democracy, especially at times of crisis.
Tripartism applies consensus democracy to economic policy by fostering social dialogue between opposing interest groups, primarily national trade unions and employers' organizations.
Consensus government chiefly arises in non-partisan democracies and similar systems in which a majority of politicians are independent. Many former British territories with large indigenous populations use consensus government to fuse traditional tribal leadership with the Westminster system. Consensus government in Canada is used in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, as well as the autonomous Nunatsiavut region, and similar systems have arisen in the Pacific island nations of Fiji, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, as well as the ancient Tynwald of the Isle of Man.

Electoral systems
The Borda count tends to elect broadly-acceptable options or candidates (rather than consistently following the preferences of a majority).

Definitions of fascism,"What constitutes a definition of fascism and fascist governments has been a complicated and highly disputed subject concerning the exact nature of fascism and its core tenets debated amongst historians, political scientists, and other scholars ever since Benito Mussolini first used the term in 1915. Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that ""trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall"".
A significant number of scholars agree that a ""fascist regime"" is foremost an authoritarian form of government; however, the general academic consensus also holds that not all authoritarian regimes are fascist, and more distinguishing traits are required in order for a regime to be characterized as such.
Similarly, fascism as an ideology is also hard to define. Originally, it referred to a totalitarian political movement linked with corporatism which existed in Italy from 1922 to 1943 under the leadership of Benito Mussolini. Many scholars use the word ""fascism"" without capitalization in a more general sense to refer to an ideology (or group of ideologies) that has been influential in many countries at various times. For this purpose, they have sought to identify what Roger Griffin calls a ""fascist minimum""—that is, the minimum conditions  a movement must meet in order to be considered fascist.
The apocalyptic and millenarian aspects of fascism have often been subjected to study.

By encyclopedias and dictionaries
Encyclopaedia Britannica
The Encyclopaedia Britannica defines fascism as a ""political ideology and mass movement that dominated many parts of central, southern, and eastern Europe between 1919 and 1945 and that also had adherents in western Europe, the United States, South Africa, Japan, Latin America, and the Middle East."", adding that ""Although fascist parties and movements differed significantly from one another, they had many characteristics in common, including extreme militaristic nationalism, contempt for electoral democracy and political and cultural liberalism, a belief in natural social hierarchy and the rule of elites, and the desire to create a Volksgemeinschaft (German: ""people's community""), in which individual interests would be subordinated to the good of the nation.""

Holocaust Encyclopedia
The Holocaust Encyclopedia defines fascism as ""a far-right political philosophy, or theory of government, that emerged in the early twentieth century. Fascism prioritizes the nation over the individual, who exists to serve the nation."" and as ""an ultranationalist, authoritarian political philosophy. It combines elements of nationalism, militarism, economic self-sufficiency, and totalitarianism. It opposes communism, socialism, pluralism, individual rights and equality, and democratic government.""

Australian Aboriginal artefacts,"Australian Aboriginal artefacts include a variety of cultural artefacts used by Aboriginal Australians. Most Aboriginal artefacts were multi-purpose and could be used for a variety of different occupations. Spears, clubs, boomerangs and shields were used generally as weapons for hunting and in warfare. Watercraft technology artefacts in the form of dugout and bark canoes were used for transport and for fishing. Stone artefacts include cutting tools and grinding stones to hunt and make food. Coolamons and carriers such as dillybags, allowed Aboriginal peoples to carry water, food and cradle babies. Message sticks were used for communication, and ornamental artefacts for decorative and ceremonial purposes. Aboriginal children’s toys were used to both entertain and educate.

Weapons
Aboriginal peoples used several different types of weapons including shields (also known as hielaman), spears, spear-throwers, boomerangs and clubs. Peoples from different regions used different weapons. Some peoples, for example, would fight with boomerangs and shields, whereas in another region they would fight with clubs. Weapons could be used both for hunting game and in warfare.

Weapons were of different styles in different areas. For example, a shield from Central Australia is very different from a shield from North Queensland.

Spears
Aboriginal peoples used spears for a variety of purposes including hunting, fishing, gathering fruit, fighting, retribution, punishment, in ceremony, as commodities for trade, and as symbolic markers of masculinity. Spears were historically used by skilful hand-throwing, but with changes in Aboriginal spear technologies during the mid-Holocene, they could be thrown further and with more accuracy with the aid of spear-thrower projectiles. Spears could be made from a variety of materials including softwoods, bamboo (Bambusa arnhemica), cane and reed. Projectile points could also be made from many different materials including flaked stone, shell, wood, kangaroo or wallaby bone, lobster claws, stingray spines, fish teeth, and more recently iron, glass and ceramics. These spear points could be bound to the spear using mastics, glues, gum, string, plant fibre and sinews.

Clubs
An Aboriginal club, otherwise known as a waddy or nulla-nulla, could be used for a variety of purposes such as for hunting, fishing, digging, for grooving tools, warfare and in ceremonies.  A fighting club, called a ‘Lil-lil’, could, with a heavy blow, break a leg, rib or skull. Clubs which could create severe trauma were made from extremely hard woods such as acacias including ironwood and mitji. Many clubs were fire hardened and others had sharpened stone quartz attached to the handle with spinifex resin.

Boomerangs
The boomerang is recognised by many as a significant cultural symbol of Australia. The term 'returning boomerang' is used to distinguish between ordinary boomerangs and the small percentage which, when thrown, will return to its thrower. The oldest ",sports
Woodchopping,"Woodchopping (also spelled wood-chopping or wood chopping), called woodchop for short, is a sport that has been around for hundreds of years in several cultures. In woodchopping competitions, skilled contestants attempt to be the first to cut or saw through a log or other block of wood. It is often held at state fairs and agricultural shows.  Participants (especially men) are often referred to as axemen.

History
The modern sport of woodchopping is said to have had its genesis in 1870 in Ulverstone, Tasmania, as the result of a £25 ($50) bet between two axemen as to who could first fell a tree. An alternative origin story comes from 16th century Basque Country, in which a man ran a marathon and chopped ten logs to be allowed to propose to his future wife.
The world's first woodchopping championship was held in 1891, at Bell's Parade, Latrobe, Tasmania. This event was celebrated and commemorated with the selection of the site to be the home of the Australian Axemen's Hall of Fame and Timberworks.

Areas of practice
Woodchopping is practiced in regions where forestry is or has been an important part of the economy:

In North America: in Canada and in the north of the United States.
In Europe: in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, England, Slovenia, the Alpine region of France, the Basque Country, other parts of Spain (mainly in Asturias and Cantabria, but also in Castile and Madrid).
In Australia and New Zealand.

Events
Many woodchopping events are handicap events, where the axemen start at different times, depending on how fast they are expected to chop through the log. In New Zealand and parts of Australia, each axeman's individual handicap is recorded in performance books which are graded on how many events they win and how many events they enter. Championship events are scratch events with no handicap, and typically use larger diameter logs (375 mm).
Handicap events may use logs of 250 mm to 350 mm, depending on the skill of the competitors. All competitors have the same size log; the handicap is based purely on time.

Standing block
This event is done by an individual cutting a scarf in one side.  Once the first side has been completed the individual starts cutting another scarf on the opposite side, slightly higher than the first, generally about two inches higher but can vary with each axeman's individual preference.

Underhand
In this event, the axeman stands on the top of the log and uses a downwards motion to chop the log in two as fast as possible.  This is done by cutting a scarf in the front side and then turning around on the block and completing it from the other side. These scarfs are generally offset from each other, the degree of offset depending on the size of the log and the axeman's preference.

Tree felling
In this event the axeman cuts a small pocket in the side of a pole and jams a wooden jigger board with a metal shoe on the end of it into the hole. The shoe is designed to grip into the",sports
Posted county price,"The Posted county price (PCP) is calculated for the so-called loan commodities (except for rice and cotton) for each county by the Farm Service Agency in the United States. The PCP reflects changes in prices in major terminal grain markets (of which there are 18 in the United States), corrected for the cost of transporting grain from the county to the terminal. It is utilized under the marketing loan repayment provisions and loan deficiency payment (LDP) provisions of the commodity programs. Rice and cotton use an adjusted world price as the proxy for local market prices.

Independent progressive,"Independent progressive is a description used both in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to denote a political progressive who lacks a formal affiliation to a party.

In the United Kingdom
In the late 19th century/early 20th century, the Progressive Party was formed as a party in that contested local government elections in London. Members included those who stood at parliamentary elections as either Liberal or Labour party candidates.
At a national level, the relationship that existed between the Liberal and Labour parties from 1906 to 1918 was referred to as the Progressive Alliance.
At the 1935 General Election, just one candidate stood as an independent progressive, and that was Gerald Bailey at Aldershot. Bailey, a Quaker, had stood as a Liberal in 1929 and since 1930 had run the National Peace Council.

Popular Front
In the late 1930s, many, including prominent Labour politician Sir Stafford Cripps, advocated a Popular Front in which the Labour and Liberal parties would unite with other groups on the left to counter the Conservative-dominated National Government. The idea was for the parties of the left to agree to support only one candidate at constituency level. In most cases this would be a known member of either the Labour or Liberal parties, but sometimes it would be a candidate of neither party, who would be supported by both parties as an independent progressive.
During the 1935-45 parliament, a number of candidates stood in by-elections as independent progressives:
Thomas Edmund Harvey, a former Liberal MP, won the 1937 Combined English Universities by-election, gaining a seat from the Conservatives.
Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell fought the 1938 Combined Scottish Universities by-election.
Sandy Lindsay fought the 1938 Oxford by-election.
Vernon Bartlett won the 1938 Bridgwater by-election, gaining the seat from the Conservatives. 
Dr Billy Carritt, a member of the Communist party, fought the 1939 Westminster Abbey by-election.

1939
With a general election expected to take place in the autumn of 1939, in a number of constituencies, the local Labour and Liberal parties agreed not to run their own candidates but instead adopt an Independent Progressive. In addition to Vernon Bartlett (Bridgwater), there was Patrick Early (Banbury), William John Brown (Stroud), William Robert Robins, (Cirencester and Tewkesbury), Michael Alexander Pinney (Tiverton) and John Langdon-Davies, (Rye).

1940–1945
During the war, this trend continued with Prof. John Alfred Ryle, who fought the 1940 Cambridge University by-election.
Reg Hipwell fought a number of by-elections: the 1941 Hampstead by-election, Scarborough & Whitby by-election, 1941, 1942 Salisbury by-election and 1943 The Hartlepools by-election. 
Gerald Kidd fought the 1942 Chichester by-election.
William Douglas-Home fought the 1942 Windsor by-election and the 1942 Glasgow Cathcart by-election. 
Alan Dawrant fought the 1943 Newark by-election.

Demagogue,"A demagogue (; from Ancient Greek  δημαγωγός (dēmagōgós) 'popular leader, mob leader'; from Ancient Greek  δῆμος (dêmos) 'people, populace' and  ἀγωγός (agōgós) 'leading, guiding'), or rabble-rouser, is a political leader in a democracy who gains popularity by arousing the common people against elites, especially through oratory that whips up the passions of crowds, appealing to emotion by scapegoating out-groups, exaggerating dangers to stoke fears, lying for emotional effect, or other rhetoric that tends to drown out reasoned deliberation and encourage fanatical popularity. Demagogues overturn established norms of political conduct, or promise or threaten to do so.: 32–38 
Historian Reinhard Luthin defined demagogue as ""a politician skilled in oratory, flattery and invective; evasive in discussing vital issues; promising everything to everybody; appealing to the passions rather than the reason of the public; and arousing racial, religious, and class prejudices—a man whose lust for power without recourse to principle leads him to seek to become a master of the masses. He has for centuries practiced his profession of 'man of the people'. He is a product of a political tradition nearly as old as western civilization itself."": 3 
Demagogues have appeared in democracies since ancient Athens. Demagogues exploit a fundamental weakness in democracy: Because ultimate power is held by the people, it is possible for the people to give that power to someone who appeals to the lowest common denominator of a large segment of the population.: 31–71  Demagogues have usually advocated immediate, forceful action to address a crisis while accusing moderate and thoughtful opponents of weakness or disloyalty. Many demagogues elected to high executive office have unraveled constitutional limits on executive power and tried to convert their democracy into a dictatorship, sometimes successfully.

History and definition of the word
A demagogue, in the strict signification of the word, is a 'leader of the rabble'.
Demagogue, a term originally referring to a leader of the common people, was first coined in ancient Greece with no negative connotation, but eventually came to mean a troublesome kind of leader who occasionally arose in Athenian democracy. Even though democracy gave power to the common people, elections still tended to favor the aristocratic class, which favored deliberation and decorum. Demagogues were a new kind of leader who emerged from the lower classes. Demagogues relentlessly advocated action, usually violent—immediately and without deliberation.
The term ""demagogue"" has been used to disparage leaders perceived as manipulative, pernicious, or bigoted.: 32–38  However, what distinguishes a demagogue can be defined independently of whether the speaker favors or opposes a certain political leader.: 32–38  A demagogue is defined by how they gain or hold democratic power: by exciting the passions of the lower classes and less-educated people in a democracy ",politics
Anti-aging medicine,"Life extension is the concept of extending the human lifespan, either modestly through improvements in medicine or dramatically by increasing the maximum lifespan beyond its generally-settled biological limit of around 125 years. Several researchers in the area, along with ""life extensionists"", ""immortalists"", or ""longevists"" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), postulate that future breakthroughs in tissue rejuvenation, stem cells, regenerative medicine, molecular repair, gene therapy, pharmaceuticals, and organ replacement (such as with artificial organs or xenotransplantations) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition (agerasia). The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by bioethicists.
The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50 billion of revenue a year in 2009. The use of such hormone products has not been proven to be effective or safe.

Average life expectancy and lifespan
During the process of aging, an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules, cells, tissues, and organs. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by ""genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication."" Oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well.
The longest documented human lifespan is 122 years 164 days, the case of Jeanne Calment, who according to records was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a wildtype mouse, commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years. Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of DNA repair, antioxidant defenses, energy metabolism, proteostasis maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy.
The average life expectancy in a population is lowered by infant and child mortality, which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of life expectancy and lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, vaccinations, good diet, exercise, and avoidance of hazards such as smoking.
Maximum lifespan is determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematod",medicine
Outline of economics,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to economics. Economics is a branch of science that analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It aims to explain how economies work and how agents (people) respond to incentives.
Economics is a behavioral science (a scientific discipline that focuses on the study of human behavior) as well as a social science  (a scientific discipline that explores aspects of human society).

Branches of economics
Macroeconomics – branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole, rather than individual markets.
Microeconomics – branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources.

Subdisciplines of economics
Agricultural economics – applied field of economics concerned with the application of economic theory in optimizing the production and distribution of food and fiber products.
Attention economics – approach to the management of information that treats human attention as a scarce commodity and applies economic theory to solve various information management problems
Behavioral economics – study of the psychological (e.g. cognitive, behavioral, affective, social) factors involved in the decisions of individuals or institutions, and how these decisions deviate from those implied by traditional economic theory.
Classical economics – theory of market economies as largely self-regulating systems, governed by natural laws of production and exchange
Comparative economic systems – sub-classification of economics dealing with the comparative study of different systems of economic organization, such as capitalism, socialism, feudalism and the mixed economy.
Contract theory – how economic actors can and do construct contractual arrangements, generally in the presence of information asymmetry
Cultural economics – branch of economics that studies the relation of culture to economic outcomes.
Demographic economics – application of economic analysis to demography, the study of human populations, including size, growth, density, distribution, and vital statistics.
Development economics – branch of economics that deals with economic aspects of the development process in low- and middle- income countries
Ecological economics – transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field of academic research addressing the interdependence and coevolution of human economies and natural ecosystems, both intertemporally and spatially.
Econometrics – application of statistical methods to economic data in order to give empirical content to economic relationships.
Economic anthropology – field that attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope, an amalgamation of economics and anthropology.
Economic development – process by which the economic well-being and quality of life of a nation, region, lo",economics

Bete-ombro,"Bete-ombro, also known as bets, tacobol, pau na lata, or taco (all of these names having a word meaning ""bat"" in them), is a Brazilian bat-and-ball game closely related to cricket. Two teams of two players each take turns batting and fielding. The batting team runs between two wickets, which are generally plastic bottles (or more reminiscent of cricket, three small wooden sticks propped up so that they all lean on each other), while the fielding team can run out batters by hitting a wicket with the ball before the closest batter reaches it. (As there are only two players on the batting team, teams swap as soon as a batter is out.) Bowled, stumped, and caught are other forms of dismissal. 
Prince Harry played it on a trip to Brazil. Taco has been credited with helping to grow and influence women's cricket in Brazil.

Overview
There has been a ""World Cup of Bets"" held in Brazil, with teams from four cities, in 2016.
When introducing cricket to Brazilian audiences, Brazilian media sometimes compare it to bete-ombro.  Bete-ombro may have been more popular in the 1990s than it is now.

Rules
Each of the two fielding players stands behind one of the wickets (called ""alvos"" (targets) or ""casinha"" (small house) in Portuguese), and each of the batters in front of one of the wickets. Whichever fielder has the ball throws it to the batter at the opposing wicket, with the other fielder being a de facto wicketkeeper. The batter may try to hit the ball; if he misses, he must place his bat in his crease to avoid being stumped (unlike cricket, the batter's body can't be used for this purpose), which is generally a circle drawn on the ground in front of the wicket. If the batters decide to run, they must cross bats with each other every time they pass each other, with the batters scoring a point every time both of them run from their crease to the opposing crease.
Similar to the Bat flip#Cricket, there is the ""wet or dry"" method of deciding which team bats first in bete-ombro: first, one side of the bat is wetted, and then the bat is thrown up in the air. The team that correctly calls whether the wet or dry side of the bat will fall face-up chooses whether to bat or bowl first. (Unlike a cricket bat, both sides of the bete-ombro bat are flat, so it wouldn't be possible to call ""Hills or Flats"").
There is a rule reminiscent of strikeouts in baseball: if the ball goes behind the batter 3 times, then they are out. The game ends when one team gets 12 or 25 points, though there may be additional conditions.

In culture
In some parts of Brazil, the expression ""largar os betes"" (to drop the bats) is used to mean ""to give up"".

Youth studies,"Youth studies is an interdisciplinary academic field devoted to the study of the development, history, culture, psychology, and politics of youth. The field studies not only specific cultures of young people, but also their relationships, roles and responsibilities throughout the larger societies which they occupy. The field includes scholars of education, literature, history, politics, religion, sociology, and many other disciplines within the humanities and social sciences. Youth studies encourages the understanding of experiences that are predominantly manifested among young people, generalized phenomenon and social change. The majority of 15- to 24-year-olds in 2008 lived in developing countries.  The definition of youth varies across cultural contexts. The social experience and organization of time and space are important themes in youth studies.  Scholars examine how neoliberalism and globalization affect how young people experience life, including in comparison to previous generations.

Economics of car use,"Compared to other popular modes of passenger transportation, the car has a relatively high cost per person-distance travelled.
The income elasticity for cars ranges from very elastic in poor countries, to inelastic in rich nations.
 The advantages of car usage include on-demand and door-to-door travel, and are not easily substituted by cheaper alternative modes of transport, with the present level and type of auto specific infrastructure in the countries with high auto usage.
Public costs related to the car are several including congestion and effects related to emissions.

Private benefits
The benefits of using a car differ by many factors, in regard to location and culture. One general benefit is availability of use which, when coupled with public support via infrastructure (such as roads or fuel stations), can allow highly flexible movement and transportation. Because public transportations are not as well omnipresent and normally don't run at certain day periods, they might not be an option. Car allows a certain freedom of movement, that other means of transport do not. Another private benefit car owners enjoy, is comfort. The car allows the transportation of the driver (and passengers) from a certain point A, to another point B, within an acclimatized and protected interior.

Private costs
According to the RAC motorists in the UK spend an average of GBP 5,000 (US$ 9,000) per year on their car, or roughly 1/3 of the average net wage; while the RACV suggests roughly AUD $10,000 per year, compared to AUD $26,000 median income among all Australian adults or AUD $66,000 median income among all Australian households.  This situation is reflected in most other Western nations. For the average car owner, depreciation constitutes about half the cost of running a car. The typical motorist underestimates this fixed cost by big margin, or even ignores it altogether, according to a survey by the RAC.
There are a number of reasons for the high cost of car transport: 

The typical private car spends most of its lifetime idle and for some vehicles, depreciation is a significant proportion of the total cost.
Compared to bulk-carrying vehicles such as airplanes, buses, and trains, individual vehicles have worse economies of scale.
Capacity utilisation is low. The average occupancy of cars is below 1.5 passengers in most parts of the world. Measures such as High-occupancy vehicle lanes try to address this issue.
The car energy efficiency is one of the lowest amongst several means of transportation.
Government taxes
The costs of running a car can be broken down as follows (in no particular order):

Fuel (including fuel tax)
Repairs
Maintenance
Financing
Insurance
Parking
Tolls on Roads, Bridges and Tunnels
Vehicle tax
Vehicle inspection
Registration
Car washes
In the UK car travel has steadily become cheaper over the past five decades. According to the Department for Transport, the real cost of running a car has dropped by 9% between 1980 and 2007.

Artificial neural membrane,"Artificial neural membrane (ANM) refers to a new class of functional structure developed through research adaptive and evolutionary neural networks and programmable materials.  The greatest interest in ANM structures surround their potential as open architecture environments for the integration of microscale and nanoscale devices.
Originally based on the Neurogenesis Algorithms developed by mathematician and engineering physicist Dr. P. A. Menges.  While working as a postdoctoral research associate at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr. Menges became interested in thin film materials used in specialized sensors also referred to as smart skins.  After leaving the laboratory she established a computational method allowing networks to automatically embed or simulate on other networks based in functional materials. 
Artificial neural membrane technology development has been funded by the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, for application to flapping wing flight.  Currently Aerospace Research Systems, Inc – the agency that pioneered work in developing artificial neurons for use in control of multifunctional smart structures – is applying the technology to reusable launch vehicles.  Other applications include biotechnology processes, morphing aircraft and spacecraft, adaptive wind generators, and artificial organs.  Recent research also indicates that ANM systems may provide the first truly automated intentional or conceptual programming environment.  The ANM technology has been referred as being as significant as semiconductors in the 1950s.

Centuriation,"Centuriation (in Latin centuriatio or, more usually, limitatio), also known as Roman grid, was a method of land measurement used by the Romans. In many cases land divisions based on the survey formed a field system, often referred to in modern times by the same name. According to O. A. W. Dilke, centuriation combined and developed features of land surveying present in Egypt, Etruria, Greek towns and Greek countryside.
Centuriation is characterised by the regular layout of a square grid traced using surveyors' instruments. It may appear in the form of roads, canals and agricultural plots. In some cases these plots, when formed, were allocated to Roman army veterans in a new colony, but they might also be returned to the indigenous inhabitants, as at Orange (France).
The study of centuriation is very important for reconstructing landscape history in many former areas of the Roman empire.

History
The Romans began to use centuriation for the foundation, in the fourth century BCE, of new colonies in the ager Sabinus, northeast of Rome. The development of the geometric and operational characteristics that were to become standard came with the founding of the Roman colonies in the Po valley, starting with Ariminum (Rimini) in 268 BCE.
The agrarian law introduced by Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BCE, which included the privatisation of the ager publicus, gave a great impetus to land division through centuriation.
Centuriation was used later for land reclamation and the foundation of new colonies as well as  for the allocation of land to veterans of the many civil wars of the late Republic and early Empire, including the battle of Philippi in 42 BCE. This is mentioned by Virgil, in his Eclogues, when he complains explicitly about the allocation of his lands near Mantua to the soldiers who had participated in that battle.
Centuriation was widely used throughout Italy and also in some provinces. For example, careful analysis has identified, in the area between Rome and Salerno, 80 different centuriation systems created at different times.

System and procedure
Various land division systems were used, but the most common was known as the ager centuriatus system.
The surveyor first identified a central viewpoint, the umbilicus. He then took up his position there and, looking towards the west, defined the territory with the following names:

ultra, the land he saw in front of him;
citra, the land behind him;
dextera, the land to his right;
sinistra, the land to his left.
He then traced the grid using an instrument known as a groma, tracing two road axes  perpendicular to each other:

the first, generally oriented east–west, was called decumanus maximus, which was traced taking as reference the place where the sun rose in order to know exactly where east was;
the second, with a north–south orientation, was called cardo maximus.

Outline of science,"The following outline is provided as a topical overview of science; the discipline of science is defined as both the systematic effort of acquiring knowledge through observation, experimentation and reasoning, and the body of knowledge thus acquired, the word ""science"" derives from the Latin word scientia meaning knowledge. A practitioner of science is called a ""scientist"". Modern science respects objective logical reasoning, and follows a set of core procedures or rules to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of all things, with a scope encompassing the entire universe. These procedures, or rules, are known as the scientific method.

Essence of science
Research – systematic investigation into existing or new knowledge.
Scientific discovery – observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences.
Laboratory – facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be performed.
Objectivity – the idea that scientists, in attempting to uncover truths about the natural world, must aspire to eliminate personal or cognitive biases, a priori commitments, emotional involvement, etc.
Inquiry – any process that has the aim of augmenting knowledge, resolving doubt, or solving a problem.

Scientific method
Scientific method (outline) – body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge, as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge. It is based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning, both deductive and inductive.

Empirical method –
Experimental method – The steps involved to produce a reliable and logical conclusion include:
Conducting initial research and asking a question about a natural phenomenon
Making observations of the phenomenon and/or collecting data about it
Forming a hypothesis – proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories.
Predicting a logical consequence of the hypothesis
Testing the hypothesis through an experiment – methodical procedure carried out with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. The 3 types of scientific experiments are:
Controlled experiment – experiment that compares the results obtained from an experimental sample against a control sample, which is practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect the effect of which is being tested (the independent variable).
Natural experiment – empirical study in which the experimental conditions (i.e., which units receive which treatment) are determined by nature or b",science

Radio
Dominica's radio stations include the government-owned DBS Radio, as well as privately owned competitors Kairi FM and Q95; a religious service called Voice of Life also operates there. DBS was founded in 1971 as Radio Dominica (supplanting material provided by Grenada's Windward Islands Broadcasting Service, WIBS), while Voice of Life was established in 1974 by two North American missionaries and began transmissions in 1976. In 1997, the island had 46,000 radio receivers.

Television
During the 1970s, relay services from Barbados' Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) represented the earliest attempts to bring television to Dominica; these were also provided to Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The experiment ceased after Hurricane David devastated the country in 1979; at the time, transmission was served from the Morne Bruce locality.
In lieu of a national television broadcast service, Dominica received cable service through the Marpin company in 1983. By 2017, it was acquired by the local division of Flow, whose name it was rebranded under.  As of the early 2020s, Flow mainly carried North American and British programming, and broadcast a weekday-morning programme entitled Good Morning Dominica. The country's other cable system, the later SAT Telecommunications, was similarly renamed Digicel Play in October 2014.
Dominica had 11,000 television sets in 2007.

Democratic revolution,"A democratic revolution is a political science term denoting a revolution in which a democracy is instituted, replacing a previous non-democratic government, or in which revolutionary change is brought about through democratic means.
According to Tocqueville, a democracy, as well as other forms of regimes, is a social condition. It holds a moral, philosophical, social and political orientation of a people. It is a way of behaving. This means that revolution in general shape behaviour. For democratic revolution, this behaviour gets more free and equal. Tocqueville's idea of a democratic revolution is that it is a steady advance of equality, which means that over time all people will be more equal.
Democratic revolutions can be divided into different approaches.

The first approach holds the development of liberation from the autocratic or dictatorial rule. The idea arises that power should be distributed more equally.
The second approach can be found in the importance of market and the realization that emerged that state socialism was not the best way of ruling a state. This idea of a popular traditional revolution arises when people get enthusiastic about the abolition or fundamental transformation of Marxist-Leninist states
The third approach derived from Western social scientists and is in relation to new ways of thinking about changes in the direction of the democracy. This can be seen as change where democracies need to be 'crafted' from above, by forming restrictions. This transformation paradigm holds the importance of strategic skills of elite actors. Mostly in combination with sheer luck, they find a way of manoeuvring under profound uncertainty. On the other hand, change can come from below, as seen in the third wave of democratization. This is what is called social forces. Mass mobilization is put together from below, mostly by the working class
What makes democratic revolutions different from other forms of revolution is the lack of violence, in most cases. Democratic revolution is not harsh and does not make negative judgements on other cultures or regime types, yet it incorporates a clear notion of reform. Other societies are becoming better and better.
Moreover, revolution is a notion implying sudden discontinuity and movement to a new regime. It is to be said that whenever there is no new regime, a revolution has failed. Democratic revolution, in contrast, does not necessarily imply how long the process will take. Formlessness is an intrinsic problem of democratic revolutions. When transitions can be (mis)interpreted as a long process, it becomes difficult to recede landmarks of failure or success into the flux of political and economic events. It is hard to know when a party is winning because there are no particular great victories or defeats that serve as milestones. An example lies in the democratic revolution of Brazil: “the genius of the Brazilian transformation is that it is virtually impossible to say at what point Brazil s",politics
Continuismo,"Continuísmo (English: Continuism) is the practice by incumbents of keeping themselves in office beyond legal term limits for their elected office, often a result or cause of democratic backsliding and the erosion of human rights.
Some Latin American heads of state indefinitely extend their rule by way of reducing or abolishing term limits, via constitutional revision. An example is Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay. Another tactic is legislative enactment, such as with Jorge Ubico, in Guatemala in 1941. A third tactic is by plebiscite, such as in the cases of Carlos Castillo Armas in Guatemala, Marcos Pérez Jiménez in Venezuela and the 1988 failed attempt by Augusto Pinochet in Chile. A further type is through a self-coup, as done by Getúlio Vargas in Brazil. Yet another way is for the outgoing incumbent to hand-pick a successor that they can use as a puppet ruler, as when Emilio Portes Gil and Abelardo Rodríguez in Mexico allowed Plutarco Elías Calles, ""el jefe máximo"", to continue ruling, a period known as the Maximato.
The extension of family rule occurred in Nicaragua with the Somoza family; in Argentina with Juan Perón; and then more recently with Néstor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernández de Kirchner; and in Cuba with Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl Castro. Despite Peru's one-term limit established by its 1979 constitution, Alberto Fujimori illegally extended his rule to ten years through two re-elections.
U.S. President Donald Trump often mused about serving in office beyond constitutional limits, before publicly ruling it out in September 2023.

Bølling–Allerød Interstadial,"The Bølling–Allerød Interstadial (Danish: [ˈpøle̝ŋ ˈæləˌʁœðˀ]), also called the Late Glacial Interstadial (LGI), was an interstadial period which occurred from 14,690 to c. 12,890 years Before Present, during the final stages of the Last Glacial Period. It was defined by abrupt warming in the Northern Hemisphere, and a corresponding cooling in the Southern Hemisphere, as well as a period of major ice sheet collapse and corresponding sea level rise known as Meltwater pulse 1A. This period was named after two sites in Denmark where paleoclimate evidence for it was first found, in the form of vegetation fossils that could have only survived during a comparatively warm period in Northern Europe. It is also referred to as Interstadial 1 or Dansgaard–Oeschger event 1.
This interstadial followed the Oldest Dryas period, which lasted from ~18,000 to 14,700 BP. While Oldest Dryas was still significantly colder than the current epoch, the Holocene, globally it was a period of warming from the very cold Last Glacial Maximum, caused by a gradual increase in CO2 concentrations. A warming of around 2 °C (3.6 °F) had occurred during this period, nearly half of which had taken place during its last couple of centuries. In contrast, the entire Bølling–Allerød Interstadial experienced very little change in global temperature. Instead, the rapid warming was limited to the Northern Hemisphere,: 677  while the Southern Hemipshere had experienced equivalent cooling. This ""polar seesaw"" pattern had occurred due to the strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (and the corresponding weakening of the Southern Ocean overturning circulation). These changes in thermohaline circulation had caused far more heat to be transferred from the Southern Hemisphere to the North.
For human populations of the Northern Hemisphere, Bølling–Allerød Interstadial had represented the first pronounced warming since the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The cold had previously forced them into refuge areas, but the warming of the interstadial enabled them to begin repopulating the Eurasian landmass. The abrupt Northern cooling of the subsequent Younger Dryas may have triggered the Neolithic Revolution, with the adoption of agriculture in the Levant.

Discovery
In 1901, Danish geologists Nikolaj Hartz (1867–1937) and Vilhelm Milthers (1865–1962) found deposits of birch trees in a clay pit near Allerød Municipality on Zealand island and later in the drained peat deposits at Bølling Lake in Jutland peninsula (both parts of Denmark). This provided proxy evidence for consistent warming at these sites during the last glacial period, because the temperatures were warm enough to support these trees. In contrast, the rest of the glacial period was so cold that the dominant plant in the area was a small, cold-adapted flower called Dryas octopetala. Thus, the cold period which preceded this interstadial is known as the Oldest Dryas, and the two subsequent cold periods as the O",history
Diplomatic capital,"Diplomatic capital refers to the trust, goodwill, and influence which a diplomat, or a state represented by its diplomats, has within international diplomacy. According to political scientist Rebecca Adler-Nissen, diplomatic capital is a kind of currency that can be traded in diplomatic negotiations and that is increased when positive ″social competences, reputation and personal authority"" are portrayed.

Accumulation and loss
Diplomatic capital can be accumulated by economic cooperation and by contributions to the solution of international crises, It is strengthened when in other countries the sentiment prevails that the interests of a state or the diplomats representing it are aligned with their own interests. Conversely, it can be squandered when a country engages in a confrontation, an armed conflict or a war, if that is perceived as unjust or at odds with the interests of others.
Diplomatic capital is also linked to the extent of enforcement of human rights.

Acupuncture,"Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine and a component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in which thin needles are inserted into the body. Acupuncture is a pseudoscience; the theories and practices of TCM are not based on scientific knowledge, and it has been characterized as quackery.
There is a range of acupuncture technological variants that originated in different philosophies, and techniques vary depending on the country in which it is performed. However, it can be divided into two main foundational philosophical applications and approaches; the first being the modern standardized form called eight principles TCM and the second being an older system that is based on the ancient Daoist wuxing, better known as the five elements or phases in the West. Acupuncture is most often used to attempt pain relief, though acupuncturists say that it can also be used for a wide range of other conditions. Acupuncture is typically used in combination with other forms of treatment.
The global acupuncture market was worth US$24.55 billion in 2017. The market was led by Europe with a 32.7% share, followed by Asia-Pacific with a 29.4% share and the Americas with a 25.3% share. It was estimated in 2021 that the industry would reach a market size of US$55 billion by 2023.
The conclusions of trials and systematic reviews of acupuncture generally provide no good evidence of benefits, which suggests that it is not an effective method of healthcare. Acupuncture is generally safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using clean needle techniques and single-use needles. When properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects. When accidents and infections do occur, they are associated with neglect on the part of the practitioner, particularly in the application of sterile techniques. A review conducted in 2013 stated that reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the preceding decade. The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections. Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.
Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as qi, meridians, and acupuncture points, and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of qi or meridians, which was a major part of early belief systems. Acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100 BC in China, around the time The Inner Classic of Huang Di (Huangdi Neijing) was published, though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier. Over time, conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar, celestial and earthly cycles, yin and yang energies, and a body's ""rhythm"" on the effectiveness of treatment. Acupuncture fluctuated in popularity in China due to changes in the country's political leadership and the preferential use of ration",medicine

Mölkky,"Mölkky (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈmølkːy]) is a Finnish throwing game invented by Lahden Paikka company (formerly known as Tuoterengas) in 1996. It is reminiscent of kyykkä, a centuries-old throwing game with Karelian roots. However, Mölkky does not require as much physical strength as kyykkä, and is more suitable for everyone regardless of age and condition. Success in Mölkky is based on a combination of chance and skill. Lahden Paikka has sold nearly 200,000 sets in Finland.
In 2016 Lahden Paikka sold all rights of Mölkky, games production and the trademark to Finnish company Tactic Games Oy.  The name Mölkky is a protected trademark. All Mölkky games are manufactured in Pori, Finland.

Rules
The set consists of a throwing pin, and 12 shorter wooden pins (also called ""skittles"") numbered from 1 to 12. The pins are initially placed in a tight group in an upright position 3–4 meters away from the throwing line, with the pins organized as follows: 1st row, 1/2; 2nd row, 3/10/4; 3rd row, 5/11/12/6; 4th row, 7/9/8. The players take turns to toss the throwing pin to try and knock over the numbered pins.
Knocking over one pin scores the number of points marked on the pin. Knocking 2 or more pins scores the number of pins knocked over (e.g., knocking over 3 pins scores 3 points). A pin does not count if it is leaning on the throwing pin or one of the numbered pins (it must be parallel to the ground to count).

After each throw, the pins are stood up again in the exact location where they landed. The first player to reach exactly 50 points wins the game. Scoring more than 50 will be penalized by setting the player's score back to 25 points. A player will be eliminated from the game if they miss all of the numbered pins three times in a row.

Organizations and competitions
Mölkky players have started more than 250 Mölkky Associations. International Mölkky Organization is the umbrella organization for Mölkky associations. 26 countries are currently official members.
The Finnish championships for mölkky have been organised in Lahti since 1997 by the union of youth clubs in Southern Tavastia. The technology students in Tampere organised world championships in academic Mölkky in 2001. The Finnish Mölkky Union has been formed to promote the game and its subculture. The first Australian Championships were held 2010 and then 2011.
The Mölkky World Championship in 2016 was the first Mölkky competition organised outside of Finland. The tournament was organized in Le Rheu, France. In 2017, it was organized in Prague in the Czech Republic, 2018 in Pori, Finland, 2019 in Samoëns, France and 2020 in Hyvinkää, Finland.　In 2024, the competition was held in Hakodate, Japan.

Freedom of thought,"Freedom of thought is the freedom of an individual to hold or consider a fact, viewpoint, or thought, independent of others' viewpoints.

Overview
Every person attempts to have a cognitive proficiency by developing knowledge, concepts, theories and assessing them in the given environment. This cognitive proficiency gives a sense of contentment and replaces the feeling of helplessness. Apart from bringing ease to the ego of a person, new knowledge and ideas also bring a hope for the future.
Freedom of thought is the precursor and progenitor of—and thus is closely linked to—other liberties, including freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression. Though freedom of thought is axiomatic for many other freedoms, they are in no way required for it to operate and exist. The conception of a freedom or a right does not guarantee its inclusion, legality, or protection via a philosophical caveat. It is a very important concept in the Western world and nearly all democratic constitutions protect these freedoms.
For instance, the United States Bill of Rights contains the famous guarantee in the First Amendment that laws may not be made that interfere with religion ""or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"". U.S. Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo reasoned in Palko v. Connecticut (1937):

Freedom of thought... is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom. With rare aberrations a pervasive recognition of this truth can be traced in our history, political and legal.
Such ideas are also a vital part of international human rights law. In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which is legally binding on member states of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), ""freedom of thought"" is listed under Article 18:

Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.
The United Nations' Human Rights Committee states that this ""distinguishes the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief from the freedom to manifest religion or belief. It does not permit any limitations whatsoever on the freedom of thought and conscience or on the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief of one's choice. These freedoms are protected unconditionally"". Similarly, Article 19 of the UDHR guarantees that ""Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference"".
Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights states, ""Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.""

Futsal,"Futsal is an association football-based sport played on a hardcourt like a basketball court, smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. It has similarities to five-a-side football and indoor football.
Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, it is played on a hard court surface marked by lines; walls or boards are not used. It is played with a smaller, harder, lower-bounce ball than association football. The surface, ball and rules favour ball control and passing in small spaces. The game also emphasizes improvisation, creativity and technique.

Name
Futsal comes from the Portuguese futebol de salão and from the Spanish fútbol sala or fútbol de salón (all translatable as ""indoor football""). During its second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name fútbol sala was used. The World Futsal Association registered the name futsal in 1985, following a dispute with FIFA over the name fútbol. Since then, futsal has become the officially and internationally accepted name, and FIFA has also started using the term.

History
Origins
Futsal started in 1930 when Juan Carlos Ceriani Gravier, a teacher in Montevideo, Uruguay, created a version of indoor football for YMCAs.
Originally developed for basketball courts, a rule book for the new sport was published in September 1933. Association football was already highly popular in the country, and after Uruguay won the 1930 World Cup and gold medals in the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics, it attracted even more practitioners. Ceriani's goal was to create a team game similar to football that could be played indoors or outdoors.
While writing the rule book, Ceriani combined the principles of association football—where the ball may be touched with every part of the body except the hands or upper part of the arms—with rules from other sports: from basketball, the number of players (five per team) and the game's duration (40 active minutes); from water polo, the goalkeeping rules; and from team handball, the field and goal sizes.
The YMCA spread the game quickly throughout South America. It was easily played by everyone, everywhere, and in any weather condition, helping players of other sports stay in shape all year round. These reasons convinced João Lotufo, a Brazilian, to bring the game to his country and adapt it to the needs of physical education.
Initially, the rules were not uniform. In 1956, the rules were modified by Habib Maphuz and Luiz Gonzaga de Oliveira Fernandes within the YMCA of São Paulo, Brazil, to allow seniors to compete. Luiz de Oliveira wrote the Book of Rules of Futsal in 1956, then adopted also at the international level.
In 1965, the Confederación Sudamericana de Futsal (South American Futsal Confederation) was created, consisting of Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru and Argentina.
Shortly after, a tournament was organized. It attracted some i",sports
Contingent sovereignty,"Contingent sovereignty refers to the new and still evolving theory which challenges the norm of non-intervention in the internal affairs of countries, commonly associated with the Westphalian doctrine of sovereignty.
In 2007, Stewart Patrick of the United States State Department described the contingent sovereignty as follows.

Historically, the main obstacle to armed intervention – humanitarian or otherwise – has been the doctrine of sovereignty, which prohibits violating the territorial integrity of another state.  One of the striking developments of the past decade has been an erosion of this non-intervention norm and the rise of a nascent doctrine of “contingent sovereignty.”
This school of thought holds that sovereign rights and immunities are not absolute.  They depend on the observance of fundamental state obligations.  These include the responsibility to protect the citizens of the state.  When a regime makes war on its people or cannot prevent atrocities against them, it risks forfeiting its claim to non-intervention.  In such circumstances, the responsibility to protect may devolve to the international community.
This emerging consensus reflects the traumas of the twentieth century.  The seminal event was the Holocaust, but it was hardly the last to shock the conscience of humankind.  From the killing fields of Cambodia to the bloody hills of Rwanda, a litany of atrocities has mocked our earnest, repeated pledges of 'Never Again.'

Following the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan described what he termed a ""developing international norm ... that massive and systematic violations of human rights wherever they may take place ... should not be allowed to stand.""  No longer should frontiers be considered an absolute defense behind which states can commit crimes against humanity with ""sovereign impunity.""
The concept of contingent sovereignty is evolving and currently not codified in international law.

Criticism
Critics argue that the concept of contingent sovereignty allows powerful countries, such as the United States, too much scope to invade other countries based in their own judgements about the human rights abuses or other wrongdoing of the government of the country concerned.

Auction theory,"Auction theory is a branch of applied economics that deals with how bidders act in auctions and researches how the features of auctions incentivise predictable outcomes. Auction theory is a tool used to inform the design of real-world auctions. Sellers use auction theory to raise higher revenues while allowing buyers to procure at a lower cost. The confluence of the price between the buyer and seller is an economic equilibrium. Auction theorists design rules for auctions to address issues that can lead to market failure. The design of these rulesets encourages optimal bidding strategies in a variety of informational settings. The 2020 Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Paul R. Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson ""for improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats.""

Introduction
Auctions facilitate transactions by enforcing a specific set of rules regarding the resource allocations of a group of bidders. Theorists consider auctions to be economic games that have two aspects: format and information. The format defines the rules for the announcement of prices, the placement of bids, the updating of prices, when the auction closes, and the way a winner is picked. The way auctions differ with respect to information regards the asymmetries of information that exist between bidders. In most auctions, bidders have some private information that they choose to withhold from their competitors. For example, bidders usually know their personal valuation of the item, which is unknown to the other bidders and the seller; however, the behaviour of bidders can influence valuations by other bidders.

History
A purportedly historical event related to auctions is a custom in Babylonia, namely when men make an offers to women in order to marry them. The more familiar the auction system is, the more situations where auctions are conducted. There are auctions for various things, such as livestock, rare and unusual items, and financial assets.
Non-cooperative games have a long history, beginning with Cournot's duopoly model. A 1994 Nobel Laureate for Economic Sciences, John Nash, proved a general-existence theorem for non-cooperative games, which moves beyond simple zero-sum games. This theory was generalized by Vickrey (1961) to deal with the unobservable value of each buyer. By the early 1970s, auction theorists had begun defining equilibrium bidding conditions for single-object auctions under most realistic auction formats and information settings. Recent developments in auction theory consider how multiple-object auctions can be performed efficiently.

Auction types
There are traditionally four types of auctions that are used for the sale of a single item:

First-price sealed-bid auction in which bidders place their bids in sealed envelopes and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer. The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins, paying the amount bid. This form of auction requires strategic considerations since bidd",economics
Independent Liberal,"Independent Liberal is a description which candidates and politicians have used to describe themselves, designating them as liberals, yet independent of the official Liberal Party of their country. To avoid confusion with the Liberal Party of Canada, the Liberal Party of the United Kingdom, and the New Zealand Liberal Party, the description can no longer be used for election purposes, but is still available in Australia.

Australia
In Australia, an Independent Liberal is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia (the major centre-right, liberal conservative party in Australia) who is either running in an election as an independent or who sits in a legislature as an independent.

Canada
Independent Liberal Members of Parliament (or of the Canadian Senate or a provincial legislative assembly) are typically former Liberal caucus members who were either expelled from the Liberal Party caucus or resigned the whip due to a political disagreement. More recent examples, include Don Johnston who sat as an Independent Liberal from January 18, 1988 until the adjournment of parliament due to his resignation from the Liberal caucus as a result of his support of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement which the party opposed, Jag Bhaduria who sat as an Independent Liberal from 1994 to 1996 following his expulsion from the Liberal caucus and Dennis Mills who briefly left the Liberal caucus in 1996 to sit as an ""Independent Liberal"" to protest the Liberal government's failure to abolish the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
Independent Liberal candidates for parliament or the legislature have been those who generally subscribe to Liberal Party principles but either have not been selected as an official Liberal Party candidate or decline to seek the party's nomination due to a disagreement with the party on certain issues. Under the current Elections Act a candidate who is not affiliated with a political party can only describe themselves on the ballot as Independent or ""No Affiliation"" and cannot describe themselves in terms of an existing political party. Accordingly, no candidate for the House of Commons of Canada has officially designated themselves an ""Independent Liberal"" since the 1968 federal election and no Independent Liberal candidate has been elected to the House of Commons since the 1957 federal election.
A number of Quebec Liberal MPs left the party and sat as Independent Liberals as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1944 as they opposed the Liberal government's decision to implement conscription. The most prominent of these was Charles Gavan Power who resigned from Cabinet over the issue. Several ran for re-election in the 1945 federal election as Independent Liberals. William Lyon Mackenzie King's government was returned with only a minority of Liberal MPs in parliament but was able to govern as a majority government with the support of Independent Liberal MPs, most of whom rejoined the party in the course of the parliament.

Taper thread,"A screw thread is a helical structure used to convert between rotational and linear movement or force. A screw thread is a ridge wrapped around a cylinder or cone in the form of a helix, with the former being called a straight thread and the latter called a tapered thread. A screw thread is the essential feature of the screw as a simple machine and also as a threaded fastener.
The mechanical advantage of a screw thread depends on its lead, which is the linear distance the screw travels in one revolution. In most applications, the lead of a screw thread is chosen so that friction is sufficient to prevent linear motion being converted to rotary, that is so the screw does not slip even when linear force is applied, as long as no external rotational force is present. This characteristic is essential to the vast majority of its uses. The tightening of a fastener's screw thread is comparable to driving a wedge into a gap until it sticks fast through friction and slight elastic deformation.

Applications
Screw threads have several applications:

Fastening:
Fasteners such as wood screws, plastic screws, machine screws, nuts, and bolts.
Connecting threaded pipes and hoses to each other and to caps and fixtures.
Gear reduction via worm drives
Moving objects linearly by converting rotary motion to linear motion, as in the leadscrew of a jack.
Measuring by correlating linear motion to rotary motion (and simultaneously amplifying it), as in a micrometer.
Both moving objects linearly and simultaneously measuring the movement, combining the two aforementioned functions, as in a leadscrew of a lathe.
In all of these applications, the screw thread has two main functions:

It converts rotary motion into linear motion.
It prevents linear motion without the corresponding rotation.

Design
Gender
Every matched pair of threads, external and internal, can be described as male and female. Generally speaking, the threads on an external surface are considered male, while the ones on an internal surface are considered female. For example, a screw has male threads, while its matching hole (whether in nut or substrate) has female threads.  This property is called gender.  Assembling a male-threaded fastener to a female-threaded one is called mating.

Handedness
The helix of a thread can twist in two possible directions, which is known as handedness. Most threads are oriented so that the threaded item, when seen from a point of view on the axis through the center of the helix, moves away from the viewer when it is turned in a clockwise direction, and moves towards the viewer when it is turned counterclockwise. This is known as a right-handed (RH) thread, because it follows the right-hand grip rule. Threads oriented in the opposite direction are known as left-handed (LH).
By common convention, right-handedness is the default handedness for screw threads. Therefore, most threaded parts and fasteners have right-handed threads. Left-handed thread applications include:

Queueing theory,"Queueing theory is the mathematical study of waiting lines, or queues. A queueing model is constructed so that queue lengths and waiting time can be predicted. Queueing theory is generally considered a branch of operations research because the results are often used when making business decisions about the resources needed to provide a service.
Queueing theory has its origins in research by Agner Krarup Erlang, who created models to describe the system of incoming calls at the Copenhagen Telephone Exchange Company. These ideas were seminal to the field of teletraffic engineering and have since seen applications in telecommunications, traffic engineering, computing, project management, and particularly industrial engineering, where they are applied in the design of factories, shops, offices, and hospitals.

Spelling
The spelling ""queueing"" over ""queuing"" is typically encountered in the academic research field. In fact, one of the flagship journals of the field is Queueing Systems.

Description
Queueing theory is one of the major areas of study in the discipline of management science. Through management science, businesses are able to solve a variety of problems using different scientific and mathematical approaches. Queueing analysis is the probabilistic analysis of waiting lines, and thus the results, also referred to as the operating characteristics, are probabilistic rather than deterministic. The probability that n customers are in the queueing system, the average number of customers in the queueing system, the average number of customers in the waiting line, the average time spent by a customer in the total queuing system, the average time spent by a customer in the waiting line, and finally the probability that the server is busy or idle are all of the different operating characteristics that these queueing models compute. The overall goal of queueing analysis is to compute these characteristics for the current system and then test several alternatives that could lead to improvement. Computing the operating characteristics for the current system and comparing the values to the characteristics of the alternative systems allows managers to see the pros and cons of each potential option. These systems help in the final decision making process by showing ways to increase savings, reduce waiting time, improve efficiency, etc. The main queueing models that can be used are the single-server waiting line system and the multiple-server waiting line system, which are discussed further below. These models can be further differentiated depending on whether service times are constant or undefined, the queue length is finite, the calling population is finite, etc.

Single queueing nodes
A queue or queueing node can be thought of as nearly a black box. Jobs (also called customers or requests, depending on the field) arrive to the queue, possibly wait some time, take some time being processed, and then depart from the queue.

However, the queueing node is n",science
Economics of coffee,"Coffee is a popular beverage and an important agricultural product. Tens of millions of small producers in developing countries make their living growing coffee. Over 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed in the world daily. Over 90 percent of coffee production takes place in developing countries — mainly South America — while consumption happens primarily in industrialized economies. There are 25 million small producers who rely on coffee for a living worldwide. In Brazil, where almost a third of the world's coffee is produced, over five million people are employed in the cultivation and harvesting of over three billion coffee plants; it is a more labor-intensive culture than alternative cultures of the same regions, such as sugar cane or cattle, as its cultivation is not automated, requiring frequent human attention.
Coffee is a major export commodity and was the top agricultural export for 12 countries in 2004; the world's seventh-largest legal agricultural export, by value, in 2005; and ""the second most valuable commodity exported by developing countries,"" from 1970 to circa 2000, which is frequently misstated — see coffee commodity market. Unroasted, or green, coffee beans comprise one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world; the commodity is traded in futures contracts on many exchanges, including the New York Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange, New York Intercontinental Exchange. Important trading and processing centers for coffee in Europe are Hamburg and Trieste.

World production
At least 20 to 25 million families around the world make a living from growing coffee. With an assumed average family size of five people, more than 100 million people are dependent on coffee growing. A total of 10.3 million tons of green coffee were harvested worldwide in 2018.
In 2016, global coffee exports were $19.4 billion. Coffee is not the second most important commercial product in the world after petroleum, but it is the second most important commercial product that is exported by developing countries. For some countries like East Timor, this is the only export item worth mentioning. Coffee sales fluctuate strongly: for example, they fell from 14 billion US dollars in 1986 to 4.9 billion US dollars in the crisis year 2001/2002. This so-called coffee crisis lasted for several years, with consequences for coffee producers worldwide.
In 2009, Brazil was the world leader in production of green coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia, Colombia and Ethiopia. Arabica coffee beans are cultivated in Latin America, eastern Africa, Arabia, or Asia. Robusta coffee beans are grown in western and central Africa, throughout southeast Asia, and to some extent in Brazil.
Beans from different countries or regions can usually be distinguished by differences in flavor, aroma, body, acidity and girth (texture) These taste characteristics are dependent not only on the coffee's growing region, but also on genetic subspecies (varietals) and proces",economics
Lightning football,"Lightning football is a shortened variation of Australian rules football, often played at half of the duration of a full match.
Lightning football is typically used as a means to accommodate a small tournament inside a single day or weekend, particularly at junior or amateur level; these tournaments are generally known as lightning premierships or lightning carnivals. At the top level of Australian rules football, lightning matches have most recently been staged as part of the Australian Football League pre-season competition.
Lightning football is distinct from AFLX, a different shortened variation of Australian rules football. Lightning football is not significantly different from standard Australian rules football other than the length of its games, while AFLX which is a heavily modified variant played on a smaller field with fewer players.

Name
The use of the word lightning, as a synonym for ""fast"", to describe an Australian rules football tournament appears to have originated with the first lightning carnival staged by the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) in 1940. The term may have been adopted from its use in chess, which had used the word lightning in the same context for many years: ""lightning chess"" tournaments were seen in Australia from as early as 1909, and were played under modified rules in which players were allowed at most ten seconds to make each move, allowing an entire tournament to be completed in just a few hours.
In a preview of the 1940 SANFL Lightning Carnival, the Advertiser journalist Jim Handby discussed the suitability of the name; while he surmised that the choice of name was primarily due to the short time over which the premiership was decided, he speculated that the shortened matches could lead to a particularly high-paced style of gameplay.
The term ""lightning premiership/carnival"" has generally entered the Australian vernacular for a condensed carnival of shortened matches in any game or sport. The term was, for example, attributed to a 1945 South Australian seven-a-side rugby union tournament, long before the sport of rugby sevens was formally codified.

Rules
Unlike other abbreviated sports, such as Twenty20 cricket, rugby sevens or Australian rules football's AFLX, lightning football is not a strictly codified sport in its own right. In many cases, the length of the game is the only difference in the rules between the full and lightning versions of the game; in other cases, some rules are modified for lightning matches.
Most commonly, lightning matches are played at half of the length of a regulation game. In the most recent lightning matches in the Australian Football League (AFL) pre-season competition, lightning matches are played over two halves, each lasting 20 minutes with time on, compared with the normal match length of four quarters each lasting 20 minutes with time-on. However, this varies from tournament to tournament, and the length is often simply adjusted based on the number of ",sports
Economic sociology,"Economic sociology is the study of the social cause and effect of various economic phenomena. The field can be broadly divided into a classical period and a contemporary one, known as ""new economic sociology"".
The classical period was concerned particularly with modernity and its constituent aspects, including rationalisation, secularisation, urbanisation, and social stratification. As sociology arose primarily as a reaction to capitalist modernity, economics played a role in much classic sociological inquiry. The specific term ""economic sociology"" was first coined by William Stanley Jevons in 1879, later to be used in the works of Émile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel between 1890 and 1920. Weber's work regarding the relationship between economics and religion and the cultural ""disenchantment"" of the modern West is perhaps most representative of the approach set forth in the classic period of economic sociology.
Contemporary economic sociology may include studies of all modern social aspects of economic phenomena; economic sociology may thus be considered a field in the intersection of economics and sociology. Frequent areas of inquiry in contemporary economic sociology include the social consequences of economic exchanges, the social meanings they involve and the social interactions they facilitate or obstruct.

Classical
Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena; emphasizing particularly the role of economic structures and institutions that play upon society, and the influence a society holds over the nature of economic structures and institutions. The relationship between capitalism and modernity is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905) and Simmel's The Philosophy of Money (1900). Economic sociology may be said to have begun with Tocqueville's Democracy in America (1835–40) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). Marx's historical materialism would attempt to demonstrate how economic forces influence the structure of society on a fundamental level. Émile Durkheim's The Division of Labour in Society was published in 1922, whilst Max Weber's Economy and Society was released in the same year.

Contemporary
Contemporary economic sociology focuses particularly on the social consequences of economic exchanges, the social meanings they involve and the social interactions they facilitate or obstruct. Influential figures in modern economic sociology include Fred L. Block, James S. Coleman, Paula England, Mark Granovetter, Harrison White, Paul DiMaggio, Joel M. Podolny, Lynette Spillman, Richard Swedberg and Viviana Zelizer in the United States, as well as Carlo Trigilia,  Donald Angus MacKenzie, Laurent Thévenot and Jens Beckert in Europe. To this may be added Amitai Etzioni, who has developed the idea of socioeconomics, and Chuck Sabel, Wolfgang Streeck and Michael Mousseau who work in the tradition of political economy/sociology",economics
Cancer exodus hypothesis,"The cancer exodus hypothesis establishes that circulating tumor cell clusters (CTC clusters) maintain their multicellular structure throughout the metastatic process. It was previously thought that these clusters must dissociate into single cells during metastasis. According to the hypothesis, CTC clusters intravasate (enter the bloodstream), travel through circulation as a cohesive unit, and extravasate (exit the bloodstream) at distant sites without disaggregating, significantly enhancing their metastatic potential. This concept is considered a key advancement in understanding of cancer biology and CTCs role in cancer metastasis.

Mechanism
Traditionally, it was believed that CTC clusters needed to dissociate into individual cells during their journey through the bloodstream to seed secondary tumors. However, recent studies show that CTC clusters can travel through the bloodstream intact, enabling them to perform every step of metastasis while maintaining their group/cluster structure. 
The cancer exodus hypothesis asserts that CTC clusters have several distinct advantages that increase their metastatic potential:

Higher metastatic efficiency: CTC clusters have been shown to possess superior seeding capabilities at distant sites compared to single CTCs.
Survival and proliferation: The collective nature of CTC clusters allows them to share resources and offer intercellular support, improving their overall survival rates in the bloodstream.
Resistance to treatment: CTC clusters exhibit unique gene expression profiles that contribute to their ability to evade certain cancer therapies, making them more resistant than individual tumor cells.

Clinical relevance
The cancer exodus hypothesis offers important insights into how metastasis occurs and highlights the significance of CTC clusters in cancer progression. Detecting and analyzing CTC clusters through liquid biopsies could offer valuable information about the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of cancers. This information is particularly useful for identifying patients who may benefit from more aggressive treatment strategies.

Characterization
The hypothesis was developed due to several key studies, which have demonstrated the ability of CTC clusters to:

Intravasate and travel as clusters: Research has shown that CTC clusters can enter the bloodstream as a group, travel through the circulatory system intact, and maintain their cluster phenotype during transit.
Extravasate through angiopellosis: A key finding of the hypothesis is that CTC clusters do not need to disaggregate to exit the bloodstream. Instead, they can undergo a process called angiopellosis, in which entire clusters migrate out of the blood vessels as a group, retaining their multicellular form. 
These findings underscore the critical role of CTC clusters in driving the metastatic cascade and suggest that CTC clusters could serve as important biomarkers in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. Additionally, u",medicine
Barette (sport),"Barette, Barrette or Barrette Acquitaine was a form of football, originating in the south-west of France. Very similar in outward appearance to rugby union, it was codified in the 1880s and evolved into a popular women's team sport in the 1920s before disappearing shortly before the Second World War.

Background
La Barette, or ""the football"", was played for many years prior to the nineteenth century in southern and central France. Also known as hien in Picardy, Artois and Brittany, and sometimes soule or shul its name comes from the name for the ball - the ""barette"".
Originally there were fairly large local differences: in some areas the ball or barrette could (or had to) be struck ""with the fist"" (sometimes protected by a gauntlet, a leather cuff, or wood) while elsewhere only the foot could be used, although in all versions the ball could also be carried. The shape of the ball was also variable: sometimes it is spherical, sometimes ovoid, and it also varied in size. The ""goal"" also varied: here a simple line on the ground, there a pair of poles or stakes driven into the ground, elsewhere, a hoop.
However, by the end of the nineteenth century the rules adopted in Paris had prevailed. Players (and particarly schools ) from across France wanted to play against each other, and a common set of rules were required. An inter-school tournament began in 1890, initially with only three teams, but the number of entries grew quickly as over the next decade.

""Paris"" rules (circa 1889)
The following is a summary of the nationally adopted ""Paris rules"" of Barette, as played in schools and clubs at the end of the nineteenth century.

The ""barette"" was ovoid and about a 30 cm long and 20 cm wide. It consisted of a rubber bladder covered with a heavy leather sheath, with the bladder inflated and properly closed, the sleeve securely sewn to the saddle point and laced on the side (resulting in a ball that resembled a rugby of the same period).
The nature of the playing area was not defined but ""the best is a large lawn or meadow that does can deal with the trampling of twenty to thirty players"". However, even grass was not essential - ""In the absence of lawn, you can simply come to the any open ground. Overall the playing area recommended was roughly 60 m × 50 m.
In the middle of the two short sides there was a three-metre-wide (9.8 ft) goal with posts at least 4 m high, and a tape or cross bar 3 m above the ground.
The aim of the game was to score a goal by first drop-kicking the ball over the tape or bar and then touching it down (""which is not easy to achieve""). Failing that a ""winning advantage"" could be scored by touching the ball down anywhere behind the goal line, which would result in a free kick at goal.
If a defending player touched the ball down they were awarded a free kick 25 m from the line.
The barette could not be thrown or punched forward, though it could be kicked or carried in the hands.
At the kick-off, the opposing team had to be 10 m from th",sports
Dynamitard,"A dynamitard was a person who used explosives for violence against the state, and is a niche metaphor for a revolutionary in politics, culture or social affairs.

Bombers
First appearing in English language newspapers in 1882, the word was understood to be a French expression applied to political terrorists in France. In reality, dynamitard is not a formal French word; French newspapers had conjured it up as a disdainful variant of dynamiteur. It was soon applied to Burton and Cunningham, Irish-Americans who had planted explosives in London. ""A term of opprobrium for some and endearment for others, the dynamitard was technically a political dynamiter, of the kind that bombed railway carriages and exploded devices in the House of Commons in the name of Irish freedom, chiefly in the early 1880s.""

Metaphorical sense
In nineteenth century politics the term came to be used, particularly by George Bernard Shaw, as metonymy for those who chose violent struggle — as opposed to gradual means — for achieving social revolution: a dynamitard was contrasted with a Fabian. Shaw himself, though a Fabian in politics, was described metaphorically as ""a dynamitard among music and drama critics"".

In popular culture
Between 1889 and 1903 Stevenston Thistle, who played in the Ayrshire Football League and elsewhere, were known as The Dynamitards. They did not live up to their name, however, losing 7-2 to Clyde F.C. in the first round of the 1894–95 Scottish Cup.

In high culture
Mocked as a neologism by Robert Louis and Fanny van de Grift Stevenson (""Any writard who writes dynamitard shall find in me a never-resting fightard""), its presence in dictionaries regretted by purists, there it has remained.

Backyard cricket,"Backyard cricket, also known as bat ball, street cricket, beach cricket, corridor cricket, garden cricket, gully cricket (on the Indian subcontinent) and box cricket (in instances of shorter grounds), is an informal variant of cricket. It is typically played in various non-traditional venues such as gardens, backyards, streets, parks, carparks, beaches, and any area not specifically designed for the sport.
Backyard cricket has connections to the pastimes of Australian, South African and New Zealand and English children who frequently lived on properties with large backyards, providing the facility to play this informal game of sport often with friends, family and neighbors. In South Asia, backyard cricket is very popular.

Overview
Though loosely based upon the game of cricket, many aspects are improvised: the playing ground, the rules, the teams, and the equipment. Quite often there are no teams at all; the players take turns at batting and there is often no emphasis on actually scoring runs. 
Equipment and field:

The bat can be anything, as long as it can hit the ball and can be suitably held in the hands. However, usage of a bat is necessary.
A ball is the other essential item.
Tennis balls are often used as they are less likely to inflict injuries or cause damage than a cricket ball. They are also much cheaper and more readily available than a leather cricket ball and are easier to hit due to their slower air-speed and relative lightness. Tennis balls also bounce more than normal cricket balls, especially at low speeds.
Sometimes a tennis ball will be heavily taped on one side to give the ball extra 'swing'. This is known as a 'swing ball' or 'tape ball'—swing balls may be made with: gaffer tape, electrical tape, plumbing tape or any other kind of tape available. A completely taped tennis ball is very popular for street cricket in Pakistan as the electric tape makes the ball heavier and less bouncy as compared to a normal tennis ball but it is still relatively harmless as compared to a real cricket ball.
The pitch can be any stretch of ground that is reasonably flat.
The wicket may be any convenient object – a chair, a cardboard box, a set of long twigs or sticks, a rubbish bin, tree or a drawing on the wall.  Often, the wicket is by no means close to the official size, but it is used anyway.
A wicket at the non-striker's end is generally a single stump if proper stumps are available and in the absence of larger objects may be just a hat or a shoe.  Its main purpose is to mark the bowler's crease, but can be instrumental when there are two batters and one may be run out.
Games with relatively few players typically forgo the teams and innings format of professional cricket, opting instead for a batters-vs-everyone format.
Garden/backyard cricket in South Africa and Australia is considered by many to be the pinnacle event of social and sporting excellence in the summer period. Many games are paired with a barbecue which often has a carnival at",sports
Geography,"Geography (from Ancient Greek γεωγραφία geōgraphía; combining gê 'Earth' and gráphō 'write', literally 'Earth writing') is the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of Earth. Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but also how they have changed and come to be. While geography is specific to Earth, many concepts can be applied more broadly to other celestial bodies in the field of planetary science. Geography has been called ""a bridge between natural science and social science disciplines.""
Origins of many of the concepts in geography can be traced to Greek Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who may have coined the term ""geographia"" (c. 276 BC – c. 195/194 BC). The first recorded use of the word γεωγραφία was as the title of a book by Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy (100 – 170 AD). This work created the so-called ""Ptolemaic tradition"" of geography, which included ""Ptolemaic cartographic theory."" However, the concepts of geography (such as cartography) date back to the earliest attempts to understand the world spatially, with the earliest example of an attempted world map dating to the 9th century BCE in ancient Babylon. The history of geography as a discipline spans cultures and millennia, being independently developed by multiple groups, and cross-pollinated by trade between these groups. The core concepts of geography consistent between all approaches are a focus on space, place, time, and scale.
Today, geography is an extremely broad discipline with multiple approaches and modalities. There have been multiple attempts to organize the discipline, including the four traditions of geography, and into branches. Techniques employed can generally be broken down into quantitative and qualitative approaches, with many studies taking mixed-methods approaches. Common techniques include cartography, remote sensing, interviews, and surveying.

Fundamentals
Geography is a systematic study of the Earth (other celestial bodies are specified, such as ""geography of Mars"", or given another name, such as areography in the case of Mars), its features, and phenomena that take place on it. For something to fall into the domain of geography, it generally needs some sort of spatial component that can be placed on a map, such as coordinates, place names, or addresses. This has led to geography being associated with cartography and place names. Although many geographers are trained in toponymy and cartology, this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the Earth's spatial and temporal distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the interaction of humans and their environment. Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as economics, health, climate, plants, and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship ",science
Mycenaean Greece,"Mycenaean Greece (or the Mycenaean civilization) was the last phase of the Bronze Age in ancient Greece, spanning the period from approximately 1750 to 1050 BC. It represents the first advanced and distinctively Greek civilization in mainland Greece with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art, and writing system. The Mycenaeans were mainland Greek peoples who were likely stimulated by their contact with insular Minoan Crete and other Mediterranean cultures to develop a more sophisticated sociopolitical culture of their own. The most prominent site was Mycenae, after which the culture of this era is named. Other centers of power that emerged included Pylos, Tiryns, and Midea in the Peloponnese, Orchomenos, Thebes, and Athens in Central Greece, and Iolcos in Thessaly. Mycenaean settlements also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia, on islands in the Aegean Sea, on the south-west coast of Asia Minor, and on Cyprus, while Mycenaean-influenced settlements appeared in the Levant and Italy.
The Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language, and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic pantheon. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace-centered states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social, and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as a wanax.
Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the Greek Dark Ages, a recordless transitional period leading to Archaic Greece where significant shifts occurred from palace-centralized to decentralized forms of socio-economic organization (including the extensive use of iron). Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the Dorian invasion or activities connected to the ""Sea Peoples"". Additional theories such as natural disasters and climatic changes have also been suggested. The Mycenaean period became the historical setting of much ancient Greek literature and mythology, including the Trojan Epic Cycle.

Chronology
The Bronze Age in mainland Greece is generally termed as the ""Helladic period"" by modern archaeologists, after Hellas, the Greek name for Greece. This period is divided into three subperiods: The Early Helladic (EH) period (c. 3200–2000 BC) was a time of prosperity with the use of metals and a growth in technology, economy and social organization. The Middle Helladic (MH) period (c. 2000–1700/1675 BC) faced a slower pace of development, as well as the evolution of megaron-type dwellings and cist grave burials. The last phase of Middle Helladic, the Middle Helladic III (c. 1750–1675 BC), along with the Late ",history
Neolithic Revolution,"The Neolithic Revolution, also known as the First Agricultural Revolution, was the wide-scale transition of many human cultures during the Neolithic period in Afro-Eurasia from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement, making an increasingly large population possible. These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants, learning how they grew and developed. This new knowledge led to the domestication of plants into crops.
Archaeological data indicate that the domestication of various types of plants and animals happened in separate locations worldwide, starting in the geological epoch of the Holocene 11,700 years ago, after the end of the last Ice Age. It was humankind's first historically verifiable transition to agriculture. The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, resulting in a decrease in the quality of human nutrition compared with that obtained previously from foraging, but because food production became more efficient, it released humans to invest their efforts in other activities and was thus ""ultimately necessary to the rise of modern civilization by creating the foundation for the later process of industrialization and sustained economic growth"".
The Neolithic Revolution involved much more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia, it transformed the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated human prehistory into sedentary (non-nomadic) societies based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their natural environment by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as irrigation and deforestation which allowed the production of surplus food. Other developments that are found very widely during this era are the domestication of animals, pottery, polished stone tools, and rectangular houses. In many regions, the adoption of agriculture by prehistoric societies caused episodes of rapid population growth, a phenomenon known as the Neolithic demographic transition.
These developments, sometimes called the Neolithic package, provided the basis for centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical ideologies, depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g. writing), densely populated settlements, specialization and division of labour, more trade, the development of non-portable art and architecture, and greater property ownership. The earliest known civilization developed in Sumer in southern Mesopotamia (c. 6,500 BP); its emergence also heralded the beginning of the Bronze Age.
The relationship of the aforementioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and their empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate. It is usually understood to vary from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal laws of soc",history
Historicism,"Historicism is an approach to explaining the existence of phenomena, especially social and cultural practices (including ideas and beliefs), by studying the process or history by which they came about. The term is widely used in philosophy, anthropology, and sociology.
This historical approach to explanation differs from and complements the approach known as functionalism, which seeks to explain a phenomenon, such as for example a social form, by providing reasoned arguments about how that social form fulfills some function in the structure of a society. In contrast, rather than taking the phenomenon as a given and then seeking to provide a justification for it from reasoned principles, the historical approach asks ""Where did this come from?"" and ""What factors led up to its creation?""; that is, historical explanations often place a greater emphasis on the role of process and contingency.
Historicism is often used to help contextualize theories and narratives, and may be a useful tool to help understand how social and cultural phenomena came to be.
The historicist approach differs from individualist theories of knowledge such as strict empiricism and rationalism, which does not take into account traditions. Historicism can be reductionist, often tends to be, and is usually contrasted with theories that posit that historical changes occur entirely at random.
David Summers, building on the work of E. H. Gombrich, defines historicism negatively, writing that it posits ""that laws of history are formulatable and that in general the outcome of history is predictable,"" adding ""the idea that history is a universal matrix prior to events, which are simply placed in order within that matrix by the historian."" This approach, he writes, ""seems to make the ends of history visible, thus to justify the liquidation of groups seen not to have a place in the scheme of history"" and that it has led to the ""fabrication of some of the most murderous myths of modern times.""

History of the term
The term historicism (Historismus) was coined by German philosopher Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel. Over time, what historicism is and how it is practiced have developed different and divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher G. B. Vico (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the dialectic of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of Karl Marx, influenced by Hegel, also occasionally include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of Franz Boas. Historicism tends to be hermeneutic because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or relativist, because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.

Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation,"The Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation (PPNF) is a U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit organization established ""to teach the public and professionals about foods, lifestyle habits, healing modalities, and environmental practices.""

History
Founded in 1952, it was first known as the Santa Barbara Medical Research Foundation and later renamed the Weston A. Price Memorial Foundation, in 1965, after the Canadian researcher Weston A. Price who emphasized the importance of nutrition for health and dentistry. The other half of the foundation's name is for Francis M. Pottenger, Jr. whose study of nutrition in cats sparked interest in a diet high in raw animal products including uncooked meats and unpasteurized dairy. In 1969, after Pottenger's death, the organization became the Price Pottenger Foundation, and then the Price Pottenger Nutrition Foundation in 1972.
PPNF now houses over 10,000 books and publications, including the works of Dr. Royal Lee, Dr. Melvin Page, Dr. Emanuel Cheraskin, Dr. William Albrecht, and others. It owns and protects the copyright to the works by Price and Pottenger, and continues to republish Price's Nutrition and Physical Degeneration and Pottenger's Pottenger's Cats – A Study in Nutrition. It publishes its own journal, the Journal of Health and Healing.

History of Caxias do Sul,"The history of Caxias do Sul, one of the main municipalities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, officially begins with the Italian colonization of the region, which started in 1875. However, indigenous tribes had lived there since ancient times, but were displaced to make way for the European settlers. The beginning of the settlement was difficult, being an area of thick virgin forest. However, quickly the forest was opened up and the first crops and livestock began to bear fruit. In 1890 trade was already flourishing and industries started to multiply. The primitive village, at the time a district of São Sebastião do Caí, was already showing signs of self-sufficiency enough to be emancipated, becoming a village governed by a provisional Council, and soon by a Municipal council and an Intendancy.

Overview
The first decades of the new municipality were turbulent. Settler groups came from various regions of Italy, some even from other countries, and had often conflicting worldviews and interests. At the same time, the state political context was agitated by constant ideological and partisan disputes, which had repercussions in the colonial area. Many episodes of violence and disagreement occurred, and the power structure proved unstable. In the midst of the disparities, the Catholic religion, common to all, revealed itself as a powerful gathering element, through which the divergences converged for the achievement of collective purposes, the Church acquiring a great influence in the destiny of the city for many decades.
At the beginning of the 20th century, society had already been structured, the initial difficulties related to survival had been overcome, and a solid cultural body began to form through the activity of artists, intellectuals, journalists, and other actors. Several social, recreational and sports clubs were founded, education improved, the urban nucleus grew rapidly and was embellished by monuments and stylish buildings, the urban infrastructure gained body, industry and commerce were solidly based in a network of cooperatives and associations, and the rural area developed great productivity, beginning a phase of important exports of a variety of fresh and processed products. In the political sphere, disputes continued, although the crises were less frequent and less dramatic. The result of this period is the formation of a differentiated and original local culture, in a mixture of Italian and Brazilian elements, in which the awareness of an inheritance from the ancient Italian civilization and the progress achieved become a reason for pride and self-affirmation.
With the establishment of the Estado Novo the federal government imposed a rapid ""Brazilianment"" of the region and began a process of repression and suppression of the signs of ""Italianness"". The compulsory cultural uprooting generated a deep identity crisis for the locals, which would only begin to be overcome in the 1950s. At this point, Caxias had already beco",history
Cura annonae,"In Imperial Rome, Cura Annonae (""care of Annona"") was the logistics system which procured and distributed grain for the cities of Rome and, after its foundation, Constantinople. The term was used in honour of the goddess Annona. The city of Rome imported all the grain consumed by its population, estimated to number 1,000,000 by the 2nd century AD. This included recipients of the grain dole or corn dole, a state-run social welfare program which gave out heavily subsidized and later free grain or bread to about 200,000 of Rome's adult male citizens.  
Rome's grain subsidies were originally ad hoc emergency measures taken to import cheap grain from trading partners and allies at times of scarcity, to help feed growing numbers of indebted and dispossessed citizen-farmers. The programmes expanded over time, such that by the end of the Republican era, the grain dole was a permanent social welfare program which comprised a substantial part of the state budget. The grain dole was reluctantly adopted by Augustus and later emperors as a free monthly issue to those who qualified to receive it. In 22 AD, Augustus' successor Tiberius publicly acknowledged the Cura Annonae as a personal and imperial duty, which if neglected would cause ""the utter ruin of the state"".
During the Imperial Era, a regular and predictable supply of subsidised grain, the grain dole, and sumptuous public games such as gladiator contests and chariot racing earned the obedience of potentially restive lower-class urban citizens, providing what the poet Juvenal sarcastically summed up as ""bread and circuses"". Sufficient capacity to supply the Cura system required both adequate production in the provinces and the operation of massive numbers of ships, generally privately-owned and hired by the government, to transport it to Rome. Most of Rome's grain supply was grown, imported, stored and traded as a profitable commodity, funded by speculators and hoarders, using loans, not state subsidies. Some provinces were almost entirely given over to the production of grain for consumption in Roman cities. The most important sources of bread grain, mostly durum wheat, were Roman Egypt, North Africa (21st century Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco), and Sicily. When the Vandals took over most of these provinces (c. 439), the Western Roman Empire lost the greater part of its grain supply.
Some form of Cura Annonae may have persisted as late as the 6th century for Rome, but far less grain was shipped compared to earlier periods; in Constantinople, capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, it lasted as late as the 7th century, in reduced form. The population of the city of Rome declined precipitously during the last years of the Western Roman Empire. Until the introduction of the railway in the 19th century, no other city was able to organize the extensive logistics needed to sustain a program resembling the Cura Annona.

Napoleonic era,"The Napoleonic era is a period in the history of France and Europe. It is generally classified as including the fourth and final stage of the French Revolution, the first being the National Assembly, the second being the Legislative Assembly, and the third being the French Directory. The Napoleonic era begins roughly with Napoleon Bonaparte's coup d'état on 18 Brumaire, overthrowing the Directory (9 November 1799), establishing the French Consulate, and ends during the Hundred Days and his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815).
The Congress of Vienna soon set out to restore Europe to pre-French Revolution days. Napoleon brought political stability to a land torn by revolution and war. He made peace with the Catholic Church and reversed the most radical religious policies of the National Convention. In 1804, Napoleon promulgated the Civil Code, a revised body of civil law, which also helped stabilize French society. The Civil Code affirmed the political and legal equality of all adult men and established a merit-based society in which individuals advanced in education and employment because of talent rather than birth or social standing. The Civil Code confirmed many of the moderate revolutionary policies of the National Assembly but retracted measures passed by the more radical Convention. The Civil Code restored patriarchal authority in the family, for example by making women and children subservient to male heads of households.
Whilst working to stabilise France, Napoleon sought to extend his authority throughout Europe. Napoleon's armies conquered the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, occupied lands, and he forced Austria, Prussia, and Russia to ally with him and respect French hegemony in Europe. The United Kingdom refused to recognize French hegemony and continued the war throughout.
The First French Empire began to unravel in 1812, when he decided to invade Russia. Napoleon underestimated the difficulties his army would have to face whilst occupying Russia. Convinced that the Tsar was conspiring with his British enemies, Napoleon led an army of 600,000 soldiers to Moscow. He defeated the Russian army at Borodino before capturing Moscow, but the Tsar withdrew and Moscow was set ablaze, leaving Napoleon's vast army without adequate shelter or supplies. Napoleon ordered a retreat, but the bitter Russian winter  and repeated Russian attacks whittled down his army, and only a battered remnant of 30,000 soldiers managed to limp back to French territory. The allies then continued a united effort against Napoleon until they had seized Paris forcing his abdication in 1814. His return to power the next year was resisted by all the allies and his army was defeated by a Prussian and Anglo-Allied force at Waterloo.

List of nuclear power accidents by country,"Worldwide, many nuclear accidents and serious incidents have occurred before and since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Two thirds of these mishaps occurred in the US. The French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) has concluded that technical innovation cannot eliminate the risk of human errors in nuclear plant operation.

Nuclear safety
The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly. Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an unexpected large earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety. Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable. An interdisciplinary team from MIT has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 to 2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.

Overview
Globally, there have been at least 99 (civilian and military) recorded nuclear power plant accidents from 1952 to 2009 (defined as incidents that either resulted in the loss of human life or more than US$50,000 of property damage, the amount the US federal government uses to define nuclear energy accidents that must be reported), totaling US$20.5 billion in property damages. Property damage costs include destruction of property, emergency response, environmental remediation, evacuation, lost product, fines, and court claims. Because nuclear power plants are large and complex, accidents on site tend to be relatively expensive.
The 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania was caused by a series of failures in secondary systems at the reactor, which allowed radioactive steam to escape and resulted in the partial core meltdown of one of two reactors at the site, making it the most significant accident in U.S. history.
The world's worst nuclear accident has been the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union, one of two accidents that has been rated as a level 7 (the highest) event on the International Nuclear Event Scale. Note that the Chernobyl disaster may have scored an 8 or 9, if the scale continued. The accident occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant after an unsafe systems test led to a series of steam explosions that destroyed reactor number four. The plume spread in the near distance primarily over Belarus and after that covered extensive portions of Europe with traces of radioactivity, leaving reindeer in Northern Europe and sheep in portions of England unfit for human consumption. A 30 kilometres (19 mi) ""Zone of alienation"" has been formed around the reactor.

Virtual environment software,"Virtual environment software refers to any software, program or system that implements, manages and controls multiple virtual environment instances (self definition). The software is installed within an organization's existing IT infrastructure and controlled from within the organization itself. From a central interface, the software creates an interactive and immersive experience for administrators and users.

Uses
Virtual environment software can be purposed for any use, from advanced military training in a virtual environment simulator to virtual classrooms. Many Virtual Environments are being purposed as branding channels for products and services by enterprise corporations and non-profit groups.
Virtual events and virtual tradeshows have been the early accepted uses of virtual event services. More recently, virtual environment software platforms have offered choices to enterprises – with the ability to connect people across the Internet. Virtual environment software enables organizations to extend their market and industry reach while reducing (all travel-related) costs and time.

Background
Providers of virtual environments have tended to focus on the early marketplace adoption of virtual events. These providers are typically software as a service (SaaS)-based. Most have evolved from the streaming media/gaming arena and social networking applications.
This early virtual event marketplace is now moving towards 3D persistent environments, where enterprises combine e-commerce, social media as core operating systems, and is evolving into virtual environments for branding, customer acquisition, and service centers. A persistent environment enables users, visitors and administrators to re-visit a part or parts of the event or session. Information gathered by attendees and end users is typically stored in a virtual briefcase typically including contact information and marketing materials.

Economics of defense,"The economics of defense  or defense economics is a subfield of economics, an application of the economic theory to the issues of military defense. It is a relatively new field. An early specialized work in the field is the RAND Corporation report The Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age by Charles J. Hitch and Roland McKean ([2] 1960, also published as a book [3]).
It is an economic field that studies the management of government budget and its expenditure during mainly war times, but also during peace times, and its consequences on economic growth. It thus uses macroeconomic and microeconomic tools such as game theory, comparative statistics, growth theory and econometrics. It has strong ties to other subfields of economics such as public finance, economics of industrial organization, international economics, labour economics and growth economics.

History
The roots of the science can be tracked back to the 1920s when The Political Economy of War by Arthur Cecil Pigou was originally published. A major step forward can be then accredited to Charles J. Hitch and Roland McKean and their work The Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age from 1960. A great contribution to the subject came in 1975 when the British economist G. Kennedy published his book The Economics of Defence. However, importance of the field grew especially in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to political instability caused by the breakup of the Soviet Union and liberation of Eastern Europe. This resulted in the publication of a complex overview of the current state of the field in 1995 from Todd Sandler and Keith Hartley called The Handbook of Defense Economics.
While the science as such started developing in the 20th century, many of its topics can be found long before then. For example, the first written set of laws called the Code of Hammurabi from the 18th century BC can be considered one of the earliest works dealing with problems and questions of the economics of defense. Similarly, economic aspects of war and military operations are broken down in a great detail in Sun Tzu's The Art of War from the 5th century BC. During the Middle Ages, political institutions emerged and a great step forward was made in military with the invention of devices using gunpowder.
Generally, developments in defense economics reflect current affairs. During the Cold War, the main topics included superpower arms races, establishment of strong and lasting alliances and nuclear weapon research. Afterwards, the focus shifted to conversion opportunities, disarmament and the peace dividend availability. And at the beginning of the new millennium, the research shifted its attention to an increasing number of regional and ethnic conflicts (Africa, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq), international terrorist threats (terrorist attacks on the USA) and weapons of mass destruction. Besides that, much work was dedicated to NATO, the European Union and other alliances that accepted new members and continue",economics
Ringette,"Ringette is a winter team sport played on an ice rink using ice hockey skates, straight sticks with drag-tips, and a blue, rubber, pneumatic ring designed for use on ice surfaces. While the sport was originally created exclusively for female competitors, it has expanded to now include participants of all gender identities. Although ringette looks ice hockey-like and is played on ice hockey rinks, the sport has its own lines and markings, and its offensive and defensive play bear a closer resemblance to lacrosse or basketball.
The sport was created in Canada in 1963 by Sam Jacks from West Ferris, Ontario, and Red McCarthy from Espanola, Ontario. Since then, it has gained popularity to the point where, in 2018, more than 50,000 individuals, including coaches, officials, volunteers, and over 30,000 players, registered to take part in the sport in Canada alone. The sport has continued to grow and has spread to other countries including the United Arab Emirates. Two different floor variants of ringette are also played: in-line ringette, and gym ringette.
Ringette is especially popular in Canada and Finland, having come to prominence as national pastimes in both countries. The premier international competition for ringette is the World Ringette Championships (WRC) which is organized by the International Ringette Federation (IRF). On the international stage, Canadian teams and Finnish teams have proved to be the most successful and are regularly at the top of the rankings. Several other countries currently organize and compete in the sport including Sweden, the United States, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, all of whom have national ringette teams though Slovakia has not competed since the 2016 World Ringette Championships. National organizations for the sport include Ringette Canada, Ringette Finland, the Sweden Ringette Association, USA Ringette, the Czech Ringette Association, and the Slovakia Ringette Association.
The sport is also played at the semi-professional level in Canada (National Ringette League), in Finland (SM–Ringette), and in Sweden (Ringette Dam-SM), as well as the university and college level. In Canada, the sport is a part of the Canada Winter Games programme and the annual Canadian Ringette Championships serves as the country's premier competition for the sport's elite amateur athletes. The sport's first international tournament was hosted in Finland in 1986.

Play
Two teams compete against each other on an ice rink while wearing ice hockey skates and using other ringette-specific equipment. The objective is to score more goals than the opposing team by shooting a blue, hollow, rubber ring into the opponent's goal net. Skaters use a long straight stick with a tapered end and a drag-tip. Ringette Canada creates the ""Official Rules and Case Book of Ringette"" for participating parties competing in Canada; it contains the forms, rules, and codes which are used in the sport nationwide.

Economics in film,"Portrayals of economics in film include the depiction of economic principles, themes, and concepts within cinematic narratives. Films often use economic elements as part of their stories, even when not explicitly focused on economics. Films can incorporate economic ideas into their narratives, often without the audience consciously recognizing them.
The integration of economic principles include portrayals of consumption decisions, resource allocation, and production costs. Film has been used as a tool to illustrate economic principles, and numerous academic and popular works explore its potential in teaching economics. By embedding economic ideas into storytelling, films reveal the pervasive nature of economic principles and their relevance to everyday life, illustrating the connections between theoretical concepts and real-world decision-making.

Background
Economics is an inescapable reality of human existence, as noted by Alfred Marshall, who described the discipline as examining ""that part of individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of the material requisites of well-being"". The omnipresence of economics in daily life, from personal budgeting decisions to global resource allocation, ensures its inevitable presence in cinematic storytelling. Films as diverse as Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory (1895) and A Corner in Wheat (1909) illustrate how economic themes have been central to film since its inception.
Film's depiction of economic principles mirrors the work of economists. Just as economic models simplify reality to focus on critical factors, films create symbolic worlds with enough realism to be credible. This parallelism extends to the exploration of human behavior under constraints such as laws, institutions, and social norms. For instance, films like The Big Short (2015) and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) not only depict financial crises and speculative behavior but also challenge audiences to reflect on the motivations and consequences of economic decision-making.
The bidirectional relationship between film and economics is noteworthy. While economic conditions influence the content and themes of films, films significantly shape public perceptions of economics and economic policies. The disparity between the reach of films like The Big Short, which sold 8.2 million tickets in the United States alone, and Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013), which sold 2.5 million copies worldwide, underscores film's broader cultural impact. Additionally, films such as Blood Diamond (2006) and Dark Waters (2019) have served as catalysts for socio-economic discourse and policy change.
Cinematic narratives often convey a dismissive attitude toward economics and markets, reflecting broader societal anxieties and misunderstandings. Such portrayals reveal valuable insights into public attitudes and the generational perspectives of filmmakers and audiences. While critics ofte",economics
Medical education in Nigeria,"Undergraduate medical education in Nigeria started in 1948 in Ibadan, based wholly on a British curriculum. Since then, medical schools expanded across the country, and medical universities now exist in almost every state, including federal, state and private universities. Medical education in Nigeria is controlled by the National Universities Commission (NUC), and the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN).

Background
In 1927, the government set up a five-year diploma programme to train medical manpower; but it was ineffective as the teachers and facilities were inadequate to train doctors to standards acceptable outside the country. The doctors were trained to practice only in Nigeria and were subjected to differential conditions of service compared to foreign-trained doctors; the ineffectiveness eventually led to its abolishment. In 1948, a college branch of the University of London was set up in Ibadan, and the graduates were to be trained at par with British counterparts and awarded a degree of the University of London. This birthed undergraduate medical education in Nigeria.

Education
Undergraduate
The undergraduate medical education in Nigeria lasts at least six years in the University. The first year is spent in the Faculty of Science studying mainly Physics, Chemistry and Zoology, and some other general subjects. The pre-clinical years last about 18months following involve didactic classroom lectures and laboratory work for about 9 hours every day and more time for dedicated self-study. The courses taken are all compulsory and include Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry. Success in the professional examination qualifies the student to proceed to the clinical years of study. Most of this next three and a half years is spent in the Teaching hospital. The courses studied include Pharmacology, Pathology, which is laboratory-based and continue till the fourth year of study.
The final two years of medical school are spent in the clinical sciences. All the principles learnt in the preceding years are applied to the care of real human patients. Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Community Medicine, Surgery, Medicine are taught at this level. Following success in the final Professional Medical School Examination, the individual obtains a Provisional License to practice medicine under supervision for a year in Nigeria by the MDCN. The accreditation of medical and dental schools in Nigeria and minimum training standards is the joint responsibility of the National Universities Commission (NUC) and the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN).1 Currently, in Nigeria, there exist 42 medical schools, of which; 17 are Federal, 18 are State institutions, and seven are privately owned.

Postgraduate Medical Education broadly includes pre-registration training of house-officers, specialist and sub-specialist training obtained after undergraduate medical education. This means academic diplomas, Masters and PhD training undertake",medicine
Real economy,"The real economy concerns the production, purchase and flow of goods and services (like oil, bread and labour) within an economy. It is contrasted with the financial economy, which concerns the aspects of the economy that deal purely in transactions of money and other financial assets, which represent ownership or claims to ownership of real sector goods and services.
In the real economy, spending is considered to be ""real"" as money is used to effect non-notional transactions, for example wages paid to employees to enact labour, bills paid for provision of fuel, or food purchased for consumption. The transaction includes the deliverance of something other than money or a financial asset. In this way, the real economy is focused on the activities that allow human beings to directly satisfy their needs and desires, apart from any speculative considerations. Economists became increasingly interested in the real economy (and its interaction with the financial economy) in the late 20th century as a result of increased global financialization, described by Krippner as ""a pattern of accumulation in which profits accrue primarily through financial channels rather than through trade and commodity production"".
The real sector is sensitive to the effect liquidity has on asset prices like, for example, if the market is saturated and asset prices collapse. In the real sector this uncertainty can mean a slowdown in aggregate demand (and in the monetary sector, an increase in the demand for money).

Schools of thought
In the neoclassical school of economics, the classical dichotomy dictates that real and nominal values in the economy can be analysed distinctly. Thus, the real sector value is determined by an actor's tastes and preferences and the cost of production, while the monetary sector only plays the part of influencing the price level, so in this simplified example the role of the supply and demand is generally limited to the quantity theory of money).
Keynesian theory rejects the classical dichotomy. Keynesians and monetarists reject it on the basis that prices are sticky – prices fail to adjust in the short run, so that an increase in the money supply raises aggregate demand and thus alters real macroeconomic variables. Post-Keynesians reject the classic dichotomy as well, for different reasons, emphasizing the role of banks in creating money, as in monetary circuit theory.
Dichotomous market theory proposes that real sector outcomes are independent of the monetary sector, related also to the idea of money neutrality.

Real property
Higher interest rates in the 1980s and 1990s reduced cash flows and decreased asset prices in several OECD countries especially as declining prices in real estate and loan losses reduced equity in the banking sector lending decreased. As real estate values declined sharply in the Northeastern United States lending also decreased.

Vernon Wesley Ruttan,"Vernon Wesley Ruttan (1924–2008) was a development economist at the University of Minnesota, where he was Regents Professor Emeritus in the Departments of Economics and Applied Economics. Ruttan's research focused on agricultural development, induced innovation, technical change and productivity growth, institutions, and development assistance policy. His book with Yujiro Hayami, Agricultural Development: An International Perspective (1971) was considered a classic in the field and was translated into four other languages.

Education and early career
Ruttan received a B.A. at Yale University in 1948,
an M.A. at the University of Chicago in 1950, and a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1952.
At the University of Chicago, Ruttan studied with Theodore Schultz, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1979.
Ruttan held positions earlier in his career at the Tennessee Valley Authority, Purdue University, the President's Council of Economic Advisors, the Rockefeller Foundation at the International Rice Research Institute in The Philippines, and President of the Agricultural Development Council.

Induced Innovation and Agricultural Development
In the book, Agricultural Development: An International Perspective, Ruttan and Hayami outline their hypothesis as follows:

The [induced innovation] model attempts to make more explicit the process by which technical and institutional changes are induced through the responses of farmers, agribusiness entrepreneurs, scientists, and public administrators to resource endowments and to changes in the supply and demand of factors and products. The state of relative endowments and accumulation of the two primary resources, land and labor, is a critical element in determining a viable patterns of technical change in agriculture. Agriculture is characterized by much stronger constraints of land on production than most other sectors of the economy. Agricultural growth may be viewed as a process of easing the constraints on production imposed by inelastic supplies of land and labor. Depending on the relative scarcity of land and labor, technical change embodied in new and more productive inputs may be induced primarily either (a) to save labor or (b) to save land. (Hayami and Ruttan, 2nd ed., p. 4).

Government investment in general purpose technology
In his book, Is War Necessary for Economic Growth? (2006), Ruttan argues that large scale and long term government investment is necessary for the development of general purpose technologies and economic growth. He analyzed the development of six different technology complexes and concluded that government investments have been important in speeding up the development of all of these, and that nuclear power would, most probably, not have been developed at all in the absence of large government investments in development.
The six technologies that were analyzed by Ruttan are:

Santa María de Óvila,"Santa María de Óvila is a former Cistercian monastery built in Spain beginning in 1181 on the Tagus River near Trillo, Guadalajara, about 90 miles (140 km) northeast of Madrid. In 1835 it was confiscated by the Spanish government and sold to private owners.
American publisher William Randolph Hearst bought parts of the monastery in 1931 with the intention of using its stones in the construction of a grand and fanciful castle at Wyntoon, California, but after some 10,000 stones were removed and shipped, they were abandoned in San Francisco for decades. These stones are now in various locations around California: the old church portal was erected at the University of San Francisco, and the chapter house was reassembled by Trappist monks at the Abbey of New Clairvaux in Vina, California. Other stones are serving as simple decorative elements in Golden Gate Park's botanical garden.
In Spain, the new government of the Second Republic declared the monastery a National Monument in June 1931, but not in time to prevent the mass removal of stones. Today, the remnant buildings and walls stand on private farmland.

History
Foundation
The monastery of Santa María de Óvila was founded in 1175 by a grant of land from King Alfonso VIII of Castile to the Cistercian monks of Valbuena Abbey in Valbuena de Duero, Valladolid Province, Castile-Leon, Spain. In this endeavor, the king was following a general strategy of establishing Catholic institutions on land he had recently won in battle from the Moors of Iberia. The Cistercian ""white monks"" (wearing undyed habits) first chose a site in Murel (now called Carrascosa de Tajo) on the Tagus, but after a few years, had to relocate to more fertile zone a few miles nearer to Trillo, Guadalajara, where a flat hilltop by the river commanded a modest view.
The construction began in 1181. The monastic quarters and the church were built over the following three decades. The central cloister was bordered on the north by the church, on the west by a barrel-vaulted great nave, on the east by the sacristy, the priory cell, and the chapter house, and on the south by the kitchen, the pantry and the refectory (dining hall). Some of the buildings were given seven-foot-thick (2 m) walls with slit windows, to serve as a refuge in case the Moors returned to the area. The church was built in the shape of a Latin cross with a nave divided into four sections, and a sanctuary with three square apses. Its presbytery had a central square topped by a pentagon.
In 1191, the king confirmed the monastery and its surrounding fields as belonging to the Cistercian Order. The aged abbot of Santa María de Huerta, bishop Martín de Finojosa (later canonized), consecrated the church in September 1213 and died days later. The surrounding area of Murel and Trillo along the Tagus prospered, giving tithes and gifts of land to the monastery. The cartulary, Cartulario de Óvila, is preserved at the University of Madrid.

Nadal formula,"The Nadal formula, also called Nadal's formula, is an equation in railway design that relates the downward force exerted by a train's wheels upon the rail, with the lateral force of the wheel's flange against the face of the rail. This relationship is significant in railway design, as a wheel-climb derailment may occur if the lateral and vertical forces are not properly considered.
The Nadal formula is represented by:

  
    
      
        
          (
          
            
              L

    {\displaystyle \left({\frac {L}{V}}\right){=}\left({\frac {\tan(\delta )-\mu }{1+\mu *\tan(\delta )}}\right)}
  

In this equation, L and V refer to the lateral and vertical forces acting upon the rail and wheel, δ is the angle made when the wheel flange is in contact with the rail face, and μ is the coefficient of friction between the wheel and the rail.
Typically, the axle load for a railway vehicle should be such that the lateral forces of the wheel against the rail should not exceed 50% of the vertical down-force of the vehicle on the rail. Put another way, there should be twice as much downward force holding the wheel to the rail, as there is lateral force which will tend to cause the wheel to climb in turns. This ratio is accomplished by matching the wheelset with the appropriate rail profile to achieve the L/V ratio desired. If the L/V ratio gets too high, the wheel flange will be pressing against the rail face, and during a turn this will cause the wheel to climb the face of the rail, potentially derailing the railcar.

Wagner Formula
The Nadal formula assumes the wheel remains perpendicular to the rail—it does not take into account hunting oscillation of the wheelset, or the movement of the wheel flange contact point against the rail.
A variation of the Nadal formula, which does take these factors into consideration, is the Wagner formula. As the wheelset yaws relative to the rail, the vertical force V is no longer completely vertical, but is now acting at an angle to the vertical, β. When this angle is factored into the Nadal formula, the result is the Wagner formula:

Castellane,"Castellane (French pronunciation: [kastɛlan]; Provençal Occitan: Castelana) is a commune in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in Southeastern France. With a population of 1,470 (2019), it has the distinction of being France's least populated subprefecture, ahead of Largentière in Ardèche.
Its inhabitants are referred to as Castellanais (masculine) and Castellanaises (feminine).

Geography
Castellane is a very old city located upstream of the Gorges du Verdon. The city is 724 metres (2,375 feet) above sea level.
The Roc, or the Roc of Notre-Dame, overlooks the city from 184 m (604 ft) above. It has been occupied since the High Middle Ages and is a registered historical site. It can be accessed from the centre of town behind the old Church of St. Andrew. The walk takes about 25 minutes.

Two reservoirs are located in the territory of Castellane:

Lake Castillon
Lake Chaudanne, created by the dam of the same name, the Barrage de Chaudanne.
The area has two water gaps: 

the clue de Taulanne containing the Asse de Blieux river and the Route Napoléon along its banks.
the clue de Chasteuil, which contains the Verdon valley.

The GR 4 hiking trail crosses through the town. The neighboring municipalities are:

Climate
Castellane features a warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb), bordering on a mediterraneran continental climate (Köppen: Dsb). Summers are warm to hot and dry, while winters are cold and snowy.

Geology
The commune is part of the Jurassic limestone area of the French Prealps in Provence, formed by the tectonic upheaval of the Alps during the Tertiary. Limestone deposits run the length of the Verdon river, giving rise to spectacular gorges formed through karst erosion. Around Castellane older formations surface, such as gypsum and Triassic black marl.
Neighboring mountains and passes

Castellard (1,725 m or 5,659 ft)
Pré Chauvin (1,741 m or 5,712 ft)
Lèques Pass, the route taken by Napoleon
Blaches Pass, on the road to Saint-André-les-Alpes

Environment
The commune contains 7,000 acres (2,800 hectares) of wood and forests (about 59% of its surface area). The Massif du Montdenier extends over the western part of the commune (former communes of Taulanne, Chasteuil and Villars-Brandis).

History of place names
Castellane's name appeared in texts for the first time circa 965–977 as Petra Castellana. The name breaks down into three Occitan terms, pèira, castel and the suffix -ana, which means fortified rock and village, and could be translated as ""Castellane rock"", in other words, the rock that has a fortified village, or simply the stronghouse or stronghold. Castellane is called Castelana in the Provençal dialect in the classical norm, or Castelano in the Mistralian.

The former commune of Castillon, now beneath the lake, appeared around 1300 as de Castilhone, an Occitan word for a small castle.
The first part of the name ""Chasteuil"" is obscure, but the second, -ialo, is a Celtic suffix for ",history
Posts and telecommunications in Lebanon,"Postal services and telecommunications have long played an essential role in Lebanon, a small country with an expansive diaspora, a vivid media landscape, and an economy geared toward trade and banking. The sector's history has nonetheless been chaotic, marked by conflict but also, and perhaps most importantly, a deeply rooted legacy of state control, weak competition, and intense politicization. A combination of poor services and high prices culminated in popular protests against the government's attempt, in October 2019, to tax the widely used messaging service WhatsApp. The anger this measure triggered captured a more general sense of dissatisfaction, and contributed to tipping the country into a protracted crisis. Civil unrest coincided with Lebanon's default on its ballooning debt; in the ensuing economic collapse, telecommunications have been among the infrastructure most affected.

Postal services
France first established a post office (or ""bureau de recette"") in the port of Beirut in November 1845. It would use French stamps and was designed primarily to facilitate French trade absent an effective Ottoman postal service. Indeed, although Lebanon was an integral part of the Ottoman Empire, the latter was in a state of growing disarray. Its overland postal services were notoriously slow and unreliable; moreover, the Ottoman Empire lacked any steamship capacity in the Mediterranean, and was thus incapable of effectively connecting coastal cities in its own empire, not to mention beyond.
By contrast, French postal services could rely on the private shipping company Paquebots de la Mediterrannee, which ran a steamship line between Marseille, Alexandria, and Beirut three times a month. On 4 October 1851, the French government allocated the concession to a state-run company, which was incorporated the following year as the Compagnie des Services Maritimes des Messageries Nationales. The latter changed names on various occasions over the years, but retains a presence in Lebanon to this day: What was known as of 1853 as the Compagnie des Messageries Imperiales was renamed in 1871 Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes, which ultimately would become, in 1996, part of CMA-CGM, which is still the main shipping operator in the port of Beirut.
The Ottoman Empire's technological disadvantage created space for empires other than France. Back in 1845, Austria may in fact have set up the first foreign post office in Beirut, although the exact date is unconfirmed. Russia inaugurated its own in 1857, Britain in 1873, and Germany in 1900. Although imperial attention focused on Beirut, France opened in Tripoli a second post office in September 1852, followed by Austria and Russia. Ottoman authorities repeatedly petitioned against this encroachment on its sovereignty, and attempted to improve their own postal services to compete, but to no avail. On the contrary, foreign networks continued to expand their coverage and range of services, notably through money trans",technology
Boomerang,"A boomerang () is a thrown tool typically constructed with airfoil sections and designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight. A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower, while a non-returning boomerang serves as a weapon to be thrown straight. Various forms of boomerang-like designs are traditionally used by some Aboriginal Australians for hunting, which were known by various names
prior to colonization.
Historically, boomerangs have been used for hunting, sport, and entertainment and are made in various shapes and sizes to suit different purposes. Although considered an Australian icon, ancient boomerangs have also been discovered in Egypt, the Americas, and Eurasia.

Description
A boomerang is a throwing stick with aerodynamic properties, traditionally made of wood, but also of bone, horn, tusks and even iron. Modern boomerangs used for sport can be made from plywood or plastics such as ABS, polypropylene, phenolic paper, or carbon fibre-reinforced plastics.
Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function, including the traditional Australian type, the cross-stick, the pinwheel, the tumble-stick, the Boomabird, and other less common types. 

Returning boomerangs fly, and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air human-made flight. A returning boomerang has two or more aerofoil section wings arranged so that when spinning they create unbalanced aerodynamic forces that curve its path into an ellipse, returning to its point of origin when thrown correctly. Their typical L-shape makes them the most recognisable form of boomerang. Although used primarily for leisure or recreation, returning boomerangs are also used to decoy birds of prey, thrown above the long grass to frighten game birds into flight and into waiting nets. Non-traditional, modern, competition boomerangs come in many shapes, sizes and materials.
Throwing sticks, valari, or kylies, are primarily used as weapons. They lack the aerofoil sections, are generally heavier and designed to travel as straight and forcefully as possible to the target to bring down game. The Tamil valari variant, of ancient origin and mentioned in the Tamil Sangam literature ""Purananuru"", was one of these.  The usual form of the Valari is two limbs set at an angle; one thin and tapering, the other rounded as a handle. Valaris come in many shapes and sizes. They are usually made of iron and cast from moulds. Some may have wooden limbs tipped with iron or sharpened edges.

Etymology
The origin of the term is uncertain. One source asserts that the term entered the language in 1827, adapted from an Aboriginal language of New South Wales, Australia, but mentions a variant, wo-mur-rang, which it dates to 1798. The first recorded encounter with a boomerang by Europeans was at Farm Cove (Port Jackson), in December 1804, when a weapon was witnessed during a tribal skirmish:

Vale Tudo,"Vale Tudo or vale-tudo (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈvali ˈtudu]; English: Everything Goes/Everything Allowed), also known as No Holds Barred (NHB) in the United States, is an unarmed, full-contact combat sport with relatively few rules. It became popular in Brazil during the 20th century and would eventually evolve into modern mixed martial arts (MMA). For years, ""Vale Tudo"" was used as a synonym for MMA in Brazil, but the term fell into disuse due to the emergence of stricter rules and the influence of the media to have a more ""civilized"" name. It is now used to refer to an early, more rules-free stage of the modern sport.
Vale Tudo initially started as an informal ruleset for fighters from different martial arts to fight each other. The Gracie family was known to organize their famous ""Gracie Challenge"", where they would fight other martial artists in Vale Tudo bouts to prove the efficiency and superiority of their own Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. Many fighters eventually started to train specifically for Vale Tudo events, mixing striking and grappling, eventually advertising ""Vale Tudo"" as its own standalone style. For example, Marco Ruas referred to his hybrid style of Luta Livre and Muay Thai striking simply as ""Vale Tudo"".

History
1920s–1980s
Fighting sideshows called vale tudo became popular in Brazilian circuses during the 1920s. Examples of such bouts were described in the Japanese-American Courier on October 4, 1928:

One report from Brasil declares that Jiu Jitsu is truly an art and that in an interesting exhibition in the side tent to the big circus a Bahian of monstrous dimensions met his waterloo at the hands of a diminutive Japanese wrestler. The man was an expert at Capoeira, an old South American style of fighting, but after putting the Japanese on his back and trying to kick his head ... the little oriental by the use of a Jiu Jitsu hold threw the Bahian and after a short struggle he was found sitting on the silent frame of the massive opponent.
However, this circus term did not enter popular use until 1959–1960, when it was used to describe the style-versus-style bouts featured in a Rio television show called Heróis do Ringue (""Heroes of the Ring""). The matchmakers and hosts of the show included members of the Gracie family, including Carlson Gracie and Carley Gracie. The participants were all legitimate practitioners of their styles. The Gracie family, which had origins in the circus business, devised the ""Gracie Challenge"", where they would invite or be challenged by opponents from other martial arts to a Vale Tudo match to prove the effectiveness of their Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. The Gracies would hold their challenges behind closed doors at their gyms, but in some cases they realised public events too.
One night during the show, João Alberto Barreto (later a referee for UFC 1) was competing against a man trained in Luta Livre. Barreto caught his opponent in an armbar and the man refused to submit. Barreto broke the man's arm. Consequently, ",sports
Dominion (political theory),"In political theory, dominion (Latin: dominium) is the exercise of authority, possession, and/or domination.

Etymology
The term comes from Latin dominium, meaning ""property, ownership"", itself derived from dominus, ""lord, master"".

In John Wyclif's thought
The term is particularly associated with the thought of John Wyclif, whose works De dominio divino libri tres (""three books on divine dominion"") and Tractatus de civili dominio (""a discourse on civil domination"") developed his concepts of divine dominion (Latin: dominium divinum) and civil dominion (Latin: dominium civilis). Wyclif argued that divine dominion determined the fundamentals of the existence of any created thing: all other kinds of power derived from divine dominion. In Wyclif's thought, humans were granted dominion by the grace of the Christian God. Prior to the Fall of Man, this dominion was absolute and he called it natural dominion. After the Fall, humans accessed only a more limited form of dominion, constrained by human sinfulness, such as individual humans' selfish desire to exercise exclusive ownership of property. Civil dominion was the dominion exercised by fallen humans over other humans or property.: 676–77 : 1434  Wyclif's ideas were influential on Jan Hus and Hussite thought.: 676–77  Wyclif's ideas about dominion have been explored in detail by Stephen E. Lahey.

The BBC World Service broadcasts on 88.2 FM in the capital, Suva.

Media control
Under the military government's Media Decree, the directors and 90 percent of the shareholders of locally based media must be citizens of, and permanently reside in Fiji. The Media Industry Development Authority of Fiji is responsible for enforcing these provisions. The authority has the power to investigate journalists and media outlets for alleged violations of the decree, including powers of search and seizure of equipment.
A code of ethics contained in the Media Decree requires that all stories run by the media be balanced, with comment obtained from both sides where there is any disagreement on the facts. This requirement enables government departments and private businesses to prevent stories from being published by not responding to media questions, thus making it impossible for the media to fulfill the decree's requirement for comment from both sides. However, media sources report that if the story is positive toward the government, the balance requirement could be ignored without consequence.

Artificial wisdom,"Artificial wisdom (AW) is an artificial intelligence (AI) system which is able to display the human traits of wisdom and morals while being able to contemplate its own “endpoint”. Artificial wisdom can be described as artificial intelligence reaching the top-level of decision-making when confronted with the most complex challenging situations. The term artificial wisdom is used when the ""intelligence"" is based on more than by chance collecting and interpreting data, but by design enriched with smart and conscience strategies that wise people would use.
The goal of artificial wisdom is to create artificial intelligence that can successfully replicate the “uniquely human trait[s]” of having wisdom and morals as closely as possible. Thus, artificial wisdom, must “incorporate [the] ethical and moral considerations” of the data it uses.
There are also many significant ethical and legal implications of AW which are compounded by the rapid advances in AI and related technologies alongside the lack of the development of ethics, guidelines, and regulations without the oversight of any kind of overarching advisory board. Additionally, there are challenges in how to develop, test, and implement AW in real world scenarios. Existing tests do not test the internal thought process by which a computer system reaches its conclusion, only the result of said process.
When examining computer-aided wisdom; the partnership of artificial intelligence and contemplative neuroscience, concerns regarding the future of artificial intelligence shift to a more optimistic viewpoint. This artificial wisdom forms the basis of Louis Molnar's monographic article on artificial philosophy, where he coined the term and proposes how artificial intelligence might view its place in the grand scheme of things.

Definitions
There are no universal or standardized definitions for human intelligence, artificial intelligence, human wisdom, or artificial wisdom. However, the DIKW pyramid, describes the continuum of relationship between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom, puts wisdom at the highest level in its hierarchy. Gottfredson defines intelligence as “the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience”.
Definitions for wisdom typically include requiring:

The ability for emotional regulation,
Pro-social behaviors (e.g., empathy, compassion, and altruism),
Self-reflection,
“A balance between decisiveness and acceptance of uncertainty and diversity of perspectives, and social advising.”
As previously defined, Artificial Wisdom would then be an AI system which is able to solve problems via “an understanding of…context, ethics and moral principles,” rather than simple pre-defined inputs or “learned patterns.” Some scientists have also considered the field of artificial consciousness. However, Jeste states that “…it is generally agreed that only humans can have consciousness, autonomy, will, and theory of min",science
Coattail effect,"The coattail effect or down-ballot effect is the tendency for a popular political party leader to attract votes for other candidates of the same party in an election. For example, in the United States, the party of a victorious presidential candidate will often win many seats in Congress as well; these Members of Congress are voted into office ""on the coattails"" of the president.
This theory is prevalent at all levels of government. Popular statewide candidates for governor or senator can also attract support for down ballot races of their party.
This is prevalent in the United Kingdom and Canada especially in a general election. People have a tendency to vote based on a political party instead of the MP for their area.
This also refers to the phenomenon that same-party members of the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives are more likely to be voted for on a year of the presidential election than a midterm.
The ""coattail effect"" is not usually caused by popular candidates convincing swing voters to cast their ballots for their party, although this is not unheard of. Rather, the effect often stems from popular candidates driving voter turnout among their own party base, people who are likely to vote for down-ballot party candidates anyway.
The ""coattail effect"" has also been used to derogatorily describe the effect of Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) in Singapore, where candidates for Parliament run on a party slate of 3 to 6 candidates. This allows weak candidates to get elected ""riding on the coattails"" of strong candidates on their slate.
Riding the coattails can be used as a generic metaphor that refers to one who achieves some level of success or notability primarily through association with someone else.

Presidential coattails
Presidential coattails is the ability of a presidential candidate to bring out supporters who then vote for his party's candidates for other offices. In effect, the other candidates are said to ride on the presidential candidate's coattails.

In the United States
Before the introduction of the secret ballot in the late 19th century, voters cast their ballots by taking a ticket provided by a party worker and putting it in the ballot box. The party-column ballot listed all candidates of the party in a single column and allowed the voter to mark off the party box at the top, which encouraged straight-party voting and the coattails effect. Straight-party voting was the norm, and winners in presidential elections often had long coattails. They almost always began their term with majorities in the House and Senate.
In modern times voting machines have replaced the party-column ballot with the office-column ballot: candidates are grouped by office rather than party. Often there is no way to cast a party-line vote, and each office must be voted on separately. The proportion of voters choosing House and presidential candidates of different parties increased from 13 percent in 1952 to more than 40 percent in the ele",politics
Medical racism in the United States,"Medical racism in the United States refers to racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare, including discriminatory medical practices and misrepresentations in medical education. Medical racism is usually driven by biases based on characteristics of patients' race and ethnicity and especially affects vulnerable subgroups such as women, children and the poor. As an ongoing phenomenon since at least the 18th century, examples of medical racism include various unethical studies, forced procedures, and differential treatments administered by health care providers, researchers, and government entities. 
While medical racism can stem from social factors like explicit prejudice or implicit bias,  structural elements also play a significant role. Government policies allowed for segregated medical facilities, and federal programs have often failed to equitably serve racial and ethnic minorities, contributing to disparities in access to and quality of care. Underfunded safety-net hospitals, low Medicaid reimbursement rates, and inequitable coverage policies—further perpetuate these disparities.
Despite legislative efforts like the Affordable Care Act aimed at reducing disparities, gaps in access to care persist, disproportionately affecting racial and ethnic minorities. The enduring influence of structural factors in healthcare contributes to these inequities, suggesting a need for continued examination and consideration of reforms to improve healthcare access and outcomes.

History
The history of medical racism has created distrust of health professionals and their practices among many people in marginalized racial and ethnic groups. Studies within the last couple decades have elucidated ongoing disparate treatment from health professionals, revealing racial biases. These racial biases have impacted the way in which treatments such as painkillers are prescribed and the rate at which diagnostic tests are given. Black patients in particular have a long history of receiving contrasting medical treatment based on different perceptions of the pain thresholds of Black people. The eugenics movement is an example of how racial bias affected the treatment of women of color, specifically African American women. However, medical racism has not been limited to Black people in the United States. While studies like the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male are infamous, the U.S. Public Health Service Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Inoculation Study of 1946-1948 harmed Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, and mental health patients by purposely infecting victims with STDs such as syphilis and gonorrhea. Forcible sterilization of Indigenous women as young as 15 years old occurred from 1970 to 1976 by the Indian Health Service as revealed in researcher Jane Lawrence's paper ""The Indian Health Service and the Sterilization of Native American Women."" Many other examples exist in American history of the unethical actions of health care providers,",medicine

Electronics industry in South Korea,"South Korea is the world's third-largest producer of electronics after China and the United States, accounting for 6.8 percent of global production. South Korea's electronics industry ranked third by production last year, and fifth by consumption. As of 2017, South Korea's electronics industry recorded a production volume of $121.7 billion.

History
For several years after Goldstar produced South Korea's first radio in 1959, the country's electronics industry was mainly focused on internally oriented import substitution, and there were no government agencies or policies to promote the electronics industry. However, the Park Chung-hee government drafted a comprehensive plan to foster the electronics industry as an export-oriented strategic industry in December 1966 after designating 'radio and electrical equipment' as one of 13 export-specialized industries in July 1965.

1966–1979
In the formative years of the electronics industry, the government strategically protected the domestic market and provided incentives for private companies to develop, produce, and export electronics for fostering. Technology has improved, ranging from assembling relatively basic products such as radios to producing more sophisticated products such as color TVs to preparing for the development of core components such as semiconductors.

1980–1992
After its formation, South Korea's electronics industry entered a period of rapid growth, during which the government shifted its focus from consumer electronics to information and communication technology, and South Korean companies greatly expanded their R&D to diversify their products and develop core components and materials. During the same period, private companies also greatly expanded their R&D. As a result, Korea developed a digital transformation system in 1982 and 64K DRAM (world's third largest after the United States and Japan) in 1983.

1993–present
Then, during the period of sophistication, the government and the private sector actively invested in improving core competencies and quality, taking Korea's electronics industry to a world level. The government provided key infrastructure for informatization and e-government, and sought and promoted new growth engines in cooperation with the private sector.

Manufacturers
The following electronics industry have marketed and sold within South Korea:

CAS Corporation
HCT Co., Ltd.
Jinwoo SMC
LG Display
LG Electronics
LG Energy Solution
Samsung Electronics

Healing Simurgh,"The Healing Simurgh (Simorgh, Seemorgh) (Persian: سیمرغ درمانگر) is the symbol of medicine in Iran. The name is inspired by Simurgh the Persian mythical flying creature, to which healing capacities have been attributed in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh.

History of Simurgh
The concept and the logo design of the Healing Simurgh was approved by the supreme board of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Medical Council in November 2013 as the emblem of the Physicians Guild of Iran, replacing the Caduceus.
In the summer of 2013, the emblem was introduced by Mahmoud Fazel, MD, the vice president of Iran's Medical Council. It was later developed by a group of renowned scholars including Jalal al-Din Kazzazi, Persian literary scholar, Mehdi Mohaghegh, author and director of the Society for the Appreciation of Cultural works and Dignitaries, Alireza Zali, President of Iran's Medical Council, Professor Nasrin Moazzemi, Biologist and member of UNESCO's Scientific Board of the International Basic Sciences Programme, and Ali Javadi Pouya, sustainable development activist and the CEO of Iran's Sustainable Development Strategy Group. The board formed a permanent association to continue with the subsequent activities required for the overhaul of Iran's national emblem for medicine, and for safeguarding this intangible cultural heritage.
The previous sign (bowl and snakes) was considered to be primarily focused on physical health. However, in the works of the prominent Iranian scholar and one of the precursors of medicine in the world, Avicenna, there is a more comprehensive understanding of health. He claims that health (sihha) is the ""disposition of human body with respect to its temperament and structure such that all of [its] actions [or functions] proceed from it in a sound and unimpaired way."" Thus the board argued that the Healing Simurgh can better represent the Iranian historical concept of health.

The Healing Simurgh's Logo
The official logo of the Healing Simurgh was designed by Touraj Saberivand, an Iranian graphic designer, and was also published as a posting stamp by the Islamic Republic of Iran Post Company.

Crony-capitalism index,"The crony-capitalism index is an index published by the British newspaper The Economist that claims to calculate whether the livelihood of the people from a certain country or city with a capitalist economy is ""easily affected by crony capitalism"". It is a measurement of crony capitalism designed based on the work by Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Aditi Gandhi and Michael Walton of Indian think-tank Centre for Policy Research, and others"" in 2014.

Aims
The index aims to be a measuring trend in the number of economic rent-seekers. The assumption behind is because of the favorable political policies set by the government officials, the tycoons are increasing their wealth and interest. As a result, they get a larger part of people's fruits of labor, instead of generating more wealth for the whole society. In some extreme cases, some favored suppliers are influential on the establishment and application of the business-impacting laws and citizens pay the tax for purchasing the overpriced products supplied by the favored corporations.

Methodology
Ten of the industries that are susceptible to monopoly or require licensing or highly depend on the government have been selected: casinos; coal, palm oil and timber; defense; deposit-taking banking and investment banking; infrastructure and pipelines; ports; airports; real estate and construction; steel and other metals; mining and commodities; utilities and telecoms services. Then, the total wealth of world's billionaires who actively involve in rent-heavy industries from the data of Forbes will be calculated. Results can be achieved from the ratio of billionaire wealth to GDP in their own countries; higher ratio of billionaire wealth to GDP indicates higher possibility of suffering from crony capitalism.

Result
2023
The 2023 index was published on 2 May 2023. Russia, by far, was the highest, with billionaire wealth from crony sectors amounting to 19% of its GDP. China recorded significant decreases in crony wealth, with total billionaire wealth from crony sectors decreasing from nearly half in 2010 to around a quarter in 2023.

2021
The 2021 index featured, Russia, Malaysia and Singapore as the top three crony-capitalism countries. Russia topped the list with 70% of the 120 billionaires holding 80% of billionaire wealth.

2016
The 2016 index was published on May 7, 2016. India is ranked in ninth position in crony-capitalism with crony sector wealth accounting for 3.4 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), according to a study by The Economist. In India, the non-crony sector wealth amounts to 8.3 per cent of the GDP, as per the latest crony-capitalism index.

2014
The results of the crony-capitalist Index of 23 countries were published on March 15, 2014. The five largest developed countries, ten largest developing countries and eight other countries where cronyism was thought to be a big problem being included.

Commodity Credit Corporation,"The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is a wholly owned United States government corporation that was created in 1933 to ""stabilize, support, and protect farm income and prices"" (federally chartered by the CCC Charter Act of 1948 (P.L. 80-806)). The CCC is authorized to buy, sell, lend, make payments, and engage in other activities for the purpose of increasing production, stabilizing prices, assuring adequate supplies, and facilitating the efficient marketing of agricultural commodities.
The CCC is essentially a financing institution for the USDA's farm price and income support commodity programs, commodity export credit guarantees, and agricultural export subsidies. The programs funded through CCC are administered by employees of the Farm Service Agency, the Agricultural Marketing Service, and the Foreign Agricultural Service.
The CCC has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the US Treasury to carry out its obligations. Net losses from its operations subsequently are restored by the Congressional appropriations process. It issues payments in the form of commodity certificates.

History and charter
The CCC was incorporated on October 17, 1933, under a Delaware charter pursuant to Executive Order 6340 issued the previous day by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It had a capitalization of $3 million subscribed by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration.
It was initially managed and operated in close affiliation with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which funded its operations. On July 1, 1939, the CCC was transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Secretary of Agriculture was granted the authority to exercise all rights of ownership of the corporation by Executive Order 8219 of 1939.
It was reincorporated on July 1, 1948, as a federal corporation within USDA by the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (62 Stat.1070; 15 U.S.C. 714).
During the 1948 presidential election campaign, Harry Truman criticized Republicans in the 80th Congress for supporting revisions to the CCC that were unpopular with farmers.
The CCC was created to stabilize, support and protect farm income and prices. The CCC is also the Federal government's primary financing arm for many domestic and international agricultural programs. The CCC helps maintain balanced and adequate supplies of agricultural commodities and aids in their orderly distribution.
The CCC helps America's agricultural producers through commodity and farm storage facility loans, purchases, and income support payments. The CCC also works to make available materials and facilities required in the production and marketing of agricultural commodities. In addition, the CCC provides incentives and payments to landowners to establish conservation practices on their land.
The CCC provides agricultural commodities to other Federal agencies and foreign governments. The CCC also donates commodities to domestic and international re",economics
Caesarism,"In political science, the term Caesarism identifies and describes an authoritarian, populist, and autocratic ideology inspired by Julius Caesar, the leader of Rome, from 49 BC to 44 BC.

History
The German historian Johann Friedrich Böhmer first used the term Caesarism in 1846, to describe the state's political subordination of the Roman Catholic Church. Published in 1850, Auguste Romieu's L'ère des Césars defined Caesarism as the military rule and régime of a warlord, and ""following Romieu's polemic, 'Caesarism' quickly gained vogue status."" In 1857, the religious writer Orestes Brownson used the term Caesarism to mean rule and régime of absolute monarchy. In 1858, the mainstream usage of the term occurs in a Westminster Review article of political criticism about the ""clumsy eulogies of Caesarism as [being] incarnate in the dynasty of Bonaparte"".
As an admirer of Julius Caesar, Napoléon Bonaparte espoused Caesarism as a justification of his rule and régime of France. Napoleon III's policy under the Second French Empire, which combined an authoritarian regime and a proactive social policy, notably with the Ollivier law of 1864, can be described as a form of ""social Caesarism"". According to historian Louis Girard (historian), this policy aims in particular to rally the workers to the regime in the face of hostile liberal bosses.
Benjamin Disraeli was accused of Caesarism in March 1878 when, in anticipation of war with Russia, he mobilised British reserves and called Indian troops to Malta. G. K. Chesterton made one of the most ringing denunciations of Caesarism in his work Heretics, calling it ""the worst form of slavery"".
Sociologist Max Weber believed that every mass democracy went in a Caesarist direction. Professor of law Gerhard Casper writes, ""Weber employed the term to stress, inter alia, the plebiscitary character of elections, disdain for parliament, the non-toleration of autonomous powers within the government and a failure to attract or suffer independent political minds.""

20th century
A so-called ""democratic"" form of Caesarism has been advocated by theorists like Venezuela's Laureano Vallenilla Lanz in Cesarismo Democrático (1919). Italian Duce Benito Mussolini and the ideology of Italian fascism espoused Caesarism.
Antonio Gramsci stated that the roots of Caesarism lie at the level of a ""crisis of authority,"" which is also a crisis of representation that occurs when social groups no longer identify with political parties. These then become anachronistic, allowing a Caesarist solution to emerge. In the Italian case, Gramsci locates the causes of this socio-political disintegration in the destabilizing experience of the First World War, where the large peasant masses were forced to fight. At the same time, they had been passive during the Risorgimento. Caesarism is a macro-social phenomenon and cannot be driven by the emergence of an individual; this phenomenon, therefore, fulfills a political function. Furthermore, Gramsci evokes the ",politics
Aromatherapy,"Aromatherapy is a practice based on the use of aromatic materials, including essential oils and other aroma compounds, with claims for improving psychological well-being. It is used as a complementary therapy or as a form of alternative medicine, and typically is used via inhalation and not by ingestion. 
Fragrances used in aromatherapy are not approved as prescription drugs in the United States. Although there is insufficient medical evidence that aromatherapy can prevent, treat or cure any disease, aromatherapy is used by some people with diseases, such as cancer, to provide general well-being and relief from pain, nausea or stress.
People may use blends of essential oils as a topical application, massage, inhalation, or water immersion. Due to the low quality of research evidence, it is uncertain if aromatherapy provides any benefit to people experiencing nausea after surgery.
Essential oils comprise hundreds to thousands of aromatic constituents, like terpinoids and phenylpropanoids, and to sufficiently research the pharmacological effects of essential oil constituents, each isolated constituent in the selected essential oil would have to be studied.

History
Oils and the belief that they had healing properties, along with other beliefs of the time, are described by Dioscorides in his De Materia Medica, written in the 1st century A.D. Distilled cedarwood oil was used by the ancient Egyptians, and the process of distilling essential oils like rose essence was refined by the 11th century Persian scholar Ibn Sina. Hildegard of Bingen used distilled lavender oil for medicinal treatments in the 12th century, and by the 15th century, oils were commonly distilled from various plant sources.
In the era of modern medicine, the name ""aromatherapy"" first appeared in print in 1937 in a French book on the subject: Aromathérapie: Les Huiles Essentielles, Hormones Végétales by René-Maurice Gattefossé, a chemist. An English version was published in 1993.
Jean Valnet, a French surgeon, pioneered the supposed medicinal uses of essential oils, which he used as antiseptics in the treatment of wounded soldiers during World War II.

Choice and purchase
Aromatherapy products, and essential oils in particular, may be regulated differently depending on their intended use. Products that are marketed with a therapeutic use in the US are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); products with a cosmetic use must meet safety requirements, regardless of their source. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates any aromatherapy advertising claims.
There are no standards for determining the quality of essential oils in the United States; while the term ""therapeutic grade"" is in use, it does not have a regulatory meaning.
Analysis using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry has been used to identify bioactive compounds in essential oils. These techniques are able to measure the levels of components to a few parts per billion. This does not make it possib",medicine
Vaquejada,"The vaquejada is a sport typical to Northeastern Brazil, in which two cowboys (""vaqueiros"") on horseback pursue a bull, seeking to pin it between the two horses and direct it to a goal (often consisting of chalk marks), where the animal is then knocked over.
On October 6, 2016, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that the vaquejada is illegal and against the Brazilian Constitution. The subject came into matter when the Government of the State of Ceará approved a state law regarding the practice. The General Attorney appealed against it to the Supreme Court, stating in the lawsuit that the animals were treated with cruelty. In its favor, the Government of Ceará sustained that it was a cultural event and represented an important part of the local economy. According to the Government of Ceará, the vaquejada creates over 200 thousand jobs. On 6 June 2017, Congress passed a constitutinal amendment overturning the Supreme Court's ban.
The city with the largest vaquejada in the world is Serrinha, in Bahia state.
The Supreme Court's decision had national coverage.

Telecommunications in the Bahamas,"Telecommunications in the Bahamas is accomplished through the transmission of information by various types of technologies within The Bahamas, mainly telephones, radio, television, and the Internet.

Status
Internet censorship and surveillance
Access to the Internet is unrestricted. There were no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without judicial oversight.
The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. An independent press combined with a relatively effective—albeit extremely backlogged—judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system ensures freedom of speech and press. The constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice. Strict and antiquated libel laws dating to British legal codes are seldom invoked.
In April 2013, the Bahamas Commissioner of Police Ellison Greenslade warned that the police would press charges against people who post “lewd” or “obscene” pictures on social media websites and Attorney General Allyson Maynard-Gibson announced that the government was working on legislation that will police information posted on the Internet. ""We have to balance freedom of the press with protecting the public,” she added. Also in April Rodney Moncur was charged with ""committing a grossly indecent act"" by posting autopsy photographs of a man who died in police custody on his Facebook page.
Phone calls to the Bahamas are monitored by the U.S. National Security Agency's MYSTIC program.

Rangeland management,"Rangeland management (also range management, range science, or arid-land management) is a natural science that centers around the study of rangelands and the ""conservation and sustainable management [of Arid-Lands] for the benefit of current societies and future generations"". Range management is defined by Holechek et al. as the ""manipulation of rangeland components to obtain optimum combination of goods and services for society on a sustained basis"". The United Nations (UN) has declared 2026 the International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists, with the Food and Agriculture Organization leading the initiative.

History
The earliest form of Rangeland Management is not formally deemed part of the natural science studied today, although its roots can be traced to nomadic grazing practices of the Neolithic Revolution when humans domesticated plants and animals under pressures from population growth and environmental change. Humans might even have altered the environment in times preceding the  Neolithic through hunting of large-game, whereby large losses of grazing herbivores could have resulted in altered ecological states; meaning humans have been inadvertently managing land throughout prehistory.
Rangeland management was developed in the United States in response to rangeland deterioration and in some cases, denudation, due to overgrazing and other misuse of arid lands as demonstrated by the 20th century ""Dust Bowl"" and described in Hardin's 1968 ""Tragedy of the Commons"". Historically, the discipline focused on the manipulation of grazing and the proper use of rangeland vegetation for livestock.

Modern application
Global
Range management's focus has been expanded to include the host of ecosystem services that rangelands provide to humans world-wide. Key management components seek to optimize such goods and services through the protection and enhancement of soils, riparian zones, watersheds, and vegetation complexes, sustainably improving outputs of consumable range products such as red meat, wildlife, water, wood, fiber, leather, energy resource extraction, and outdoor recreation, as well as maintaining a focus on the manipulation of grazing activities of large herbivores to maintain or improve animal and plant production. With increasing levels of rangeland degradation, for example as evident through woody plant encroachment, active rehabilitation efforts become part of rangeland management.
Pastoralism has become a contemporary anthropological and ecological study as it faces many threats including fragmentation of land, conversion of rangeland into urban development, lack of grazing movement, impending threats on global diversity, damage to species with large terrain, decreases in shared public goods, decreased biological movements, threats of a ""tragedy of enclosures"", limitation of key resources, reduced biomass and invasive plant species growth. Interest in contemporary pastoralist cultures like the Maasai has continued to increase, espec",science
Ideology,"An ideology is a set of beliefs or values attributed to a person or group of persons, especially those held for reasons that are not purely about belief in certain knowledge, in which ""practical elements are as prominent as theoretical ones"". Formerly applied primarily to economic, political, or religious theories and policies, in a tradition going back to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, more recent use treats the term as mainly condemnatory.
The term was coined by Antoine Destutt de Tracy, a French Enlightenment aristocrat and philosopher, who conceived it in 1796 as the ""science of ideas"" to develop a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational impulses of the mob. In political science, the term is used in a descriptive sense to refer to political belief systems.

Etymology
The term ideology originates from French idéologie, itself coined from combining Greek: idéā (ἰδέα, 'notion, pattern'; close to the Lockean sense of idea) and -logíā (-λογῐ́ᾱ, 'the study of').

History
The term ""ideology"" and the system of ideas associated with it were developed in 1796 by Antoine Destutt de Tracy (1754-1836), who crystallised his ideas while in prison (November 1793 to October 1794) pending trial during the Reign of Terror of c. 1793 to July 1794. While imprisoned he read the works of Locke and Étienne Bonnot de Condillac.
Hoping to form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences, Tracy devised the term for a ""science of ideas"", basing such upon two things: (1) the sensations that people experience as they interact with the material world; and (2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. Tracy conceived of ideology as a liberal philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property, free markets, and constitutional limits on state power. He argues that, among these aspects, ideology is the most generic term because the 'science of ideas' also contains the study of their expression and deduction. The coup d'état that overthrew Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794 allowed Tracy to pursue his work. Tracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution (during the Napoleonic regime of 1799 to 1815 as part of the Napoleonic Wars) by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob-impulses that had nearly destroyed him.
A subsequent early source for the near-original meaning of ideology is Hippolyte Taine's work on the Ancien Régime, Origins of Contemporary France (French: Les Origines de la France Contemporaine) volume I (1875). He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy via the Socratic method, though without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Tracy but also with his milieu, and includes Condillac as one of its precursors.
Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) came to view ideology as a term of abuse, which he often hurled against hi",politics
Actuarial science,"Actuarial science is the discipline that applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance, pension, finance, investment and other industries and professions.
Actuaries are professionals trained in this discipline. In many countries, actuaries must demonstrate their competence by passing a series of rigorous professional examinations focused in fields such as probability and predictive analysis.
Actuarial science includes a number of interrelated subjects, including mathematics, probability theory, statistics, finance, economics, financial accounting and computer science. Historically, actuarial science used deterministic models in the construction of tables and premiums. The science has gone through revolutionary changes since the 1980s due to the proliferation of high speed computers and the union of stochastic actuarial models with modern financial theory.
Many universities have undergraduate and graduate degree programs in actuarial science. In 2010, a study published by job search website CareerCast ranked actuary as the #1 job in the United States. The study used five key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress. In 2024, U.S. News & World Report ranked actuary as the third-best job in the business sector and the eighth-best job in STEM.

Subfields
Life insurance, pensions and healthcare
Actuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial, life insurance, and annuities. These long term coverages required that money be set aside to pay future benefits, such as annuity and death benefits many years into the future. This requires estimating future contingent events, such as the rates of mortality by age, as well as the development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested. This led to the development of an important actuarial concept, referred to as the present value of a future sum. Certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern financial economics.

In traditional life insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of mortality, the production of life tables, and the application of compound interest to produce life insurance, annuities and endowment policies. Contemporary life insurance programs have been extended to include credit and mortgage insurance, key person insurance for small businesses, long term care insurance and health savings accounts.
In health insurance, including insurance provided directly by employers, and social insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of rates of disability, morbidity, mortality, fertility and other contingencies. The effects of consumer choice and the geographical distribution of the utilization of medical services and procedures, and the utilization of drugs and therapies, is also of great importance.

Chuiwan,"Chuiwan (Chinese: 捶丸; pinyin: chuíwán; lit. 'ball-hitting') was a game in ancient China. Its rules resemble modern  golf.
The book Dongxuan lu (東軒錄), written by Wei Tai (魏泰; fl. 1050–1100) of the Song dynasty, describes how a southern Tang official teaches his daughter how to dig goals in the ground and drive a ball into them. The game became popular by the Song dynasty; and a work called Wan jing (丸經, lit. 'ball-treatise') of the Yuan dynasty was specially devoted to it. The latest documents about chuiwan in China are from the two paintings of the Ming dynasty from the 15th century. There is a color image of the mural painting still preserved on the wall of a Water God Temple in Hongdong, Shanxi. Ling Honglin, a Chinese professor at Lanzhou University, suggested the game was exported to Europe and then Scotland by Mongol travellers in the late Middle Ages.
The rules for chuiwan are remarkably similar to that of modern golf, in that players use restricted number of clubs (up to 10 in chuiwan, 14 in golf), holes are spread on terrains of varying difficulty, and marked by colored flags; and there is also strict etiquette and rules with regard to player honesty, with penalties for cheating. Chuiwan balls are of different sizes and made of wood. The tee-off areas are called ji (基; lit. 'base').
The popularity of chuiwan peaked in the Song dynasty, during which time Emperor Huizong is reported to have been a dedicated player, and it remained a favorite sport during the Yuan and Ming dynasties.  In the Qing dynasty the game of Chuiwan steadily declined, and it eventually became a casual game for women and children.

Systems ecology,"Systems ecology is an interdisciplinary field of ecology, a subset of Earth system science, that takes a holistic approach to the study of ecological systems, especially ecosystems.  Systems ecology can be seen as an application of general systems theory to ecology.  Central to the systems ecology approach is the idea that an ecosystem is a complex system exhibiting emergent properties.  Systems ecology focuses on interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems, and is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions.  It uses and extends concepts from thermodynamics and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems.

Overview
Systems ecology seeks a holistic view of the interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems. Systems ecologists realise that the function of any ecosystem can be influenced by human economics in fundamental ways.  They have therefore taken an additional transdisciplinary step by including economics in the consideration of ecological-economic systems. In the words of R.L. Kitching:

Systems ecology can be defined as the approach to the study of ecology of organisms using the techniques and philosophy of systems analysis: that is, the methods and tools developed, largely in engineering, for studying, characterizing and making predictions about complex entities, that is, systems..
In any study of an ecological system, an essential early procedure is to draw a diagram of the system of interest ... diagrams indicate the system's boundaries by a solid line. Within these boundaries, series of components are isolated which have been chosen to represent that portion of the world in which the systems analyst is interested ... If there are no connections across the systems' boundaries with the surrounding systems environments, the systems are described as closed. Ecological work, however, deals almost exclusively with open systems.
As a mode of scientific enquiry, a central feature of Systems Ecology is the general application of the principles of energetics to all systems at any scale. Perhaps the most notable proponent of this view was Howard T. Odum - sometimes considered the father of ecosystems ecology. In this approach the principles of energetics constitute ecosystem principles. Reasoning by formal analogy from one system to another enables the Systems Ecologist to see principles functioning in an analogous manner across system-scale boundaries. H.T. Odum commonly used the Energy Systems Language as a tool for making systems diagrams and flow charts.
The fourth of these principles, the principle of maximum power efficiency, takes central place in the analysis and synthesis of ecological systems. The fourth principle suggests that the most evolutionarily advantageous system function occurs when the environmental load matches the internal resistance of the system.

Grain trade,"The grain trade refers to the local and international trade in cereals such as wheat, barley, maize, and rice,  and other food grains. Grain is an important trade item because it is easily stored and transported with limited spoilage, unlike other agricultural products. Healthy grain supply and trade is important to many societies, providing a caloric base for most food systems as well as important role in animal feed for animal agriculture.
The grain trade is as old as agricultural settlement, identified in many of the early cultures that adopted sedentary farming.  Major societal changes have been directly connected to the grain trade, such as the fall of the Roman Empire. From the early modern period onward, grain trade has been an important part of colonial expansion and international power dynamics. The geopolitical dominance of countries like Australia, the United States, Canada and the Soviet Union during the 20th century was connected with their status as grain surplus countries.
More recently, international commodity markets have been an important part of the dynamics of food systems and grain pricing. Speculation, as well as other compounding production and supply factors leading up to the 2007–2008 financial crises, created rapid inflation of grain prices during the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. More recently, the dominance of Ukraine and Russia in grain markets such as wheat meant that the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused increased fears of a global food crises in 2022. Changes to agriculture caused by climate change are expected to have cascading effects on global grain markets.

History
The grain trade is probably nearly as old as grain growing, going back the Neolithic Revolution (around 9,500 BCE). Wherever there is a scarcity of land (e.g. cities), people must bring in food from outside to sustain themselves, either by force or by trade.  However, many farmers throughout history (and today) have operated at the subsistence level, meaning they produce for household needs and have little leftover to trade.  The goal for such farmers is not to specialize in one crop and grow a surplus of it, but rather to produce everything his family needs and become self-sufficient.  Only in places and eras where production is geared towards producing a surplus for trade (commercial agriculture), does a major grain trade become possible.

Classical world
In the ancient world, grain regularly flowed from the hinterlands to the cores of great empires: maize in ancient Mexico, rice in ancient China, and wheat and barley in the ancient Near East.  With this came improving technologies for storing and transporting grains; the Hebrew Bible makes frequent mention of ancient Egypt's massive grain silos.
Merchant shipping was important for the carriage of grain in the classical period (and continues to be so). A Roman merchant ship could carry a cargo of grain the length of the Mediterranean for the cost of moving the same amount 15 miles by",economics
Big tent,"A big tent party, or catch-all party, is a political party having members covering a broad spectrum of beliefs. This is in contrast to other kinds of parties, which defend a determined ideology, seek voters who adhere to that ideology, and attempt to convince people towards it.

Examples
Armenia
Following the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election, the My Step Alliance rose to power on an anti-corruption and pro-democracy platform. The alliance has been described as maintaining a big tent ideology, as the alliance did not support any one particular political position. Instead, it focused on strengthening Armenia's civil society and economic development.

Australia
The Liberal Party of Australia and its predecessors originated as an alliance of liberals and conservatives in opposition to the Australian Labor Party, beginning with the Commonwealth Liberal Party in 1909. This ideological distinction has endured to the present day, with the modern Liberal Party frequently described as a ""broad church"", a term popularised by former leader and Prime Minister John Howard. In this context, ""broad church"" is largely synonymous with ""big tent"". In the 21st century, the party is often characterised as having a ""small-l liberal"" wing and a conservative wing, which frequently come into conflict with each other. The party has historically found strong support primarily from the middle-class, though it has in recent decades appealed to socially conservative working-class voters.

Argentina
From its foundation the Justicialist Party has been a Peronist catch-all party, which focuses on the figure of Juan Perón and his wife Eva. Since Nestor Kirchner took the presidency in 2003, the party is considered as part of center-left coalition. It has divided into left-wing and right-wing factions, with left-wing populist Kirchnerists now dominating the party. Despite this, the right-wing faction still exists.
Juntos por el Cambio is an Argentine big tent political coalition. It was created in 2015 as Cambiemos. It is composed of Republican Proposal (centre-right), Civic Coalition ARI (centre) and Radical Civic Union (centre), with common goals to oppose Peronist parties. It is considered as part of center-right coalition.

Bangladesh
In Bangladesh Awami League's Grand Alliance (Bangladesh) and BNP's 20 Party Alliance forms coalition with a wide range of parties, thus being catch all parties.

Brazil
In Brazil, the Centrão (lit. 'big centre') is a term for a large bloc of political parties that do not have a specific or consistent ideological orientation and whose aim is to maintain proximity to the executive branch in order to guarantee advantages and allow them to distribute privileges through clientelistic networks. The Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) is one of the oldest and most notable ""Centrão"" and Big Tent parties in Brazil; despite being Brazil's largest party, both in number of members and number of officials elected, it has never elected a President, but has ",politics
War studies,"War studies, sometimes called polemology, is the multi-disciplinary study of war. It pertains to the military, diplomatic, philosophical, social, political, psychological or economic dimensions of human conflict. The word polemology derives from Ancient Greek: πόλεμος, romanized: pólemos, lit. 'war, battle' + -logy.

History
In 1943, King's College London reestablished its military science department as the Department of War Studies. The department was discontinued in 1948, and the field of war studies was taught in the Department of Medieval and Modern History until the Department of War Studies was reinstated in 1962.

The Great Binge,"The Great Binge is a 21st-century neologism, coined by amateur historian Gradus Protus van den Belt, describing the period in history covering roughly 1870 to 1914.

History
It is so known because of the widespread use and availability of narcotics such as opium, heroin, cocaine, morphine, and absinthe. During this period these drugs were widely available and incredibly popular among both men and women of many social classes in many parts of the world. They were marketed to both adults and children, often included in patent medicines such as cough syrups, pain relievers, and asthma medicines. They were administered to infants and women with menstrual cramps, and included in food and beverages such as Coca-Cola. Literary characters such as Sherlock Holmes were portrayed using morphine and cocaine. Holmes is described as having a particular penchant for overt injections of a 7% solution of cocaine, though only when lacking adequate mental stimulation.
The period ended with a series of laws regulating narcotic drugs in various countries and internationally.  The International Opium Convention, signed in The Hague in 1912 by 11 countries and entering into force in 1915, was the first stab at a comprehensive drug control treaty internationally and inspired domestic drug control laws such as the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act in the United States.

Slang
""Binge"" is 19th century slang, although the meaning has evolved. However, the specific application of the term ""great binge"" relative to drug use and popular attitudes towards drug use circa 1870–1914 is relatively recent. As well as its use by Bryars and Harper cited above, it was used by British author and comedian Stephen Fry to describe this period in ""More Fool Me"" and by academic Nicholas J. Saunders in 'The Poppy: A History of Conflict, Loss, Remembrance, and Redemption', speaking primarily of the US, to describe a 19th-century ""characterised by various narcotics that were legal, widely available, widely consumed and deeply embedded in popular culture"". Popular use goes back a little further. Esquire Magazine used it in this context in 2009: Dracula ""appeared right in the middle of what historians call the Great Binge, a period in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when cocaine and heroin use ran rampant"". A Canadian psychologist, Romeo Vitelli, used the term online in a post dated September 2, 2007.

Nudity,"Nudity is the state of being in which a human is without clothing. While estimates vary, for the first 90,000 years of pre-history, anatomically modern humans were naked, having lost their body hair, living in hospitable climates, and not having developed the crafts needed to make clothing. 
As humans became behaviorally modern, body adornments such as jewelry, tattoos, body paint and scarification became part of non-verbal communications, indicating a person's social and individual characteristics. Indigenous peoples in warm climates used clothing for decorative, symbolic or ceremonial purposes but were often nude, having neither the need to protect the body from the elements nor any conception of nakedness being shameful. In many societies, both ancient and contemporary, children might be naked until the beginning of puberty. Women may not cover their breasts due to the association with nursing babies more than with sexuality.
In the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, from Mesopotamia to the Roman Empire, proper attire was required to maintain social standing. The majority might possess a single piece of cloth that was wrapped or tied to cover the lower body; slaves might be naked. However, through much of Western history until the modern era, people of any status were also unclothed by necessity or convenience when engaged in labor and athletics; or when bathing or swimming. Such functional nudity occurred in groups that were usually, but not always, segregated by sex. Although improper dress might be socially embarrassing, the association of nudity with sin regarding sexuality began with Judeo-Christian societies, spreading through Europe in the post-classical period. Traditional clothing in temperate regions worldwide also reflect concerns for maintaining social status and order, as well as by necessity due to the colder climate. However, societies such as Japan and Finland maintain traditions of communal nudity based upon the use of baths and saunas that provided alternatives to sexualization.
The spread of Western concepts of modest dress was part of colonialism, and continues today with globalization. Contemporary social norms regarding nudity reflect cultural ambiguity towards the body and sexuality, and differing conceptions of what constitutes public versus private spaces. Norms relating to nudity are different for men than they are for women. Individuals may intentionally violate norms relating to nudity; those without power may use nudity as a form of protest, and those with power may impose nakedness on others as a form of punishment.
While the majority of contemporary societies require clothing in public, some recognize non-sexual nudity as being appropriate for some recreational, social or celebratory activities, and appreciate nudity in the arts as representing positive values. A minority within many countries assert the benefits of social nudity, while other groups continue to disapprove of nudity not only in public but",science
Political economy in anthropology,"Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including but not limited to non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Most anthropologists moved away from modes of production analysis typical of structural Marxism, and focused instead on the complex historical relations of class, culture and hegemony in regions undergoing complex colonial and capitalist transitions in the emerging world system.
Political economy was introduced in American anthropology primarily through the support of Julian Steward, a student of Kroeber. Steward's research interests centered on “subsistence” — the dynamic interaction of man, environment, technology, social structure, and the organization of work. This emphasis on subsistence and production - as opposed to exchange - is what distinguishes the political economy approach. Steward's most theoretically productive years were from 1946 to 1953, while teaching at Columbia University.  At this time, Columbia saw an influx of World War II veterans who were attending school thanks to the GI Bill. Steward quickly developed a coterie of students who would go on to develop Political Economy as a distinct approach in anthropology, including Sidney Mintz, Eric Wolf, Eleanor Leacock, Roy Rappaport, Stanley Diamond, Robert Manners, Morton Fried, Robert F. Murphy, and influenced other scholars such as Elman Service, Marvin Harris and June Nash. Many of these students participated in the Puerto Rico Project, a large-scale group research study that focused on modernization in Puerto Rico.
Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the ""pre-capitalist"" societies that were subject to evolutionary ""tribal"" stereotypes. Sahlins' work on hunter-gatherers as the ""original affluent society"" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.
More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

Theory
Cultural materialism
Cultural materialism is a research orientation introduced by Marvin Harris in 1968 (The Rise of Anthropological Theory), as a theoretical paradigm and research strategy. Indeed, it is said to be the most enduring achievement of that work. Harris subsequently developed a defense of the paradigm in his 1979 book Cultural Materialism. To Harris, cultural materialism ""is based on the simple premise that human social life is a response to the practical problems of earthly existence"".
Harris' approach was influ",economics
Drought tolerance,"In botany, drought tolerance is the ability by which a plant maintains its biomass production during arid or drought conditions. Some plants are naturally adapted to dry conditions, surviving with protection mechanisms such as desiccation tolerance, detoxification, or repair of xylem embolism. Other plants, specifically crops like corn, wheat, and rice, have become increasingly tolerant to drought with new varieties created via genetic engineering. From an evolutionary perspective, the type of mycorrhizal associations formed in the roots of plants can determine how fast plants can adapt to drought.
The plants behind drought tolerance are complex and involve many pathways which allows plants to respond to specific sets of conditions at any given time. Some of these interactions include stomatal conductance, carotenoid degradation and anthocyanin accumulation, the intervention of osmoprotectants (such as sucrose, glycine, and proline), ROS-scavenging enzymes. The molecular control of drought tolerance is also very complex and is influenced other factors such as environment and the developmental stage of the plant. This control consists mainly of transcriptional factors, such as dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (DREB), abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element-binding factor (AREB), and NAM (no apical meristem).

Physiology of drought tolerance
Plants can be subjected to slowly developing water shortages (ie, taking days, weeks, or months), or they may face short-term deficits of water (ie, hours to days). In these situations, plants adapt by responding accordingly, minimizing water loss and maximizing water uptake. Plants are more susceptible to drought stress during the reproductive stages of growth, flowering and seed development. Therefore, the combination of short-term plus long-term responses allow for plants to produce a few viable seeds. Some examples of short-term and long-term physiological responses include:

Short-term responses
In the leaf: root-signal recognition, stomatal closure, decreased carbon assimilation
In the stem: inhibition of growth, hydraulic changes, signal transport, assimilation of transport
In the root: cell-drought signalling, osmotic adjustment

Long-term responses
In the above-ground portion of the plant: inhibition of shoot growth, reduced transpiration area, grain abortion, senescence, metabolic acclimation, osmotic adjustment, anthocyanin accumulation, carotenoid degradation, intervention of osmoprotectants, ROS-scavenging enzymes
In the below-ground portion of the plant: turgor maintenance, sustained root growth, increased root/shoot, increased absorption area

Regulatory network of drought tolerance
In response to drought conditions, there is an alteration of gene expression, induced by or activated by transcription factors (TFs). These TFs bind to specific cis-elements to induce the expression of targeted stress-inducible genes, allowing for products to be transcribed that help with stress response ",economics
International rules football,"International rules football (Irish: Peil na rialacha idirnáisiunta; also known as international rules in Australia and compromise rules or Aussie rules in Ireland) is a team sport consisting of a hybrid of football codes, which was developed to facilitate international representative matches between Australian rules football players and Gaelic football players.
The first tour, known as the Australian Football World Tour, took place in 1967, with matches played in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The following year, games were played between Australia and a touring County Meath Gaelic football team, Meath being the reigning All-Ireland senior football champions. Following intermittent international tests between Australia and Ireland, the International Rules Series between the senior Australia international rules football team and Ireland international rules football team has been played intermittently since 1984, and has generally been a closely matched contest.  The sport has raised interest and exposure in developing markets for Gaelic and Australian football and has been considered a development tool by governing bodies of both codes, particularly by the AFL Commission.
International rules football does not have any dedicated clubs or leagues. It is currently played by men's, women's, and junior teams only in tournaments or Test matches. The University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom holds an annual International Rules tournament between its Australian Rules and Gaelic Football teams.

Rules
Overview
The rules are designed to provide a compromise or combine between those of the two codes, with Gaelic football players being advantaged by the use of a round ball and a rectangular field measured about 145 m (159 yards) long by 90 m (98 yards) wide (Australian rules uses an oval ball and field), while the Australian rules football players benefit from the opportunity to tackle by grabbing between the shoulders and thighs and pulling to the ground, something banned in Gaelic football. The game also introduces the concept of the mark, from Australian rules football, with a free kick awarded for a ball caught from a kick of over 15 metres (16 yd), where the kick must be in the forward direction if originating from a teammate.
A player must bounce, solo (kick into one's own hands) or touch the ball on the ground once every 10 metres (11 yd) or six steps. A maximum of two bounces per possession are allowed, while players can solo the ball as often as they wish on a possession. Unlike in Gaelic football, the ball may be lifted directly off the ground, without putting a foot underneath it first. Players however cannot scoop the ball off the ground to a team-mate, nor pick up the ball if they are on their knees or on the ground. If a foul is committed, a free kick will be awarded, though referees (called umpires in Australian Rules) can give the fouled player advantage to play on at their discretion.

The game uses two large posts ",sports
Austerity,"In economic policy, austerity is a set of political-economic policies that aim to reduce government budget deficits through spending cuts, tax increases, or a combination of both. There are three primary types of austerity measures: higher taxes to fund spending, raising taxes while cutting spending, and lower taxes and lower government spending. Austerity measures are often used by governments that find it difficult to borrow or meet their existing obligations to pay back loans. The measures are meant to reduce the budget deficit by bringing government revenues closer to expenditures. Proponents of these measures state that this reduces the amount of borrowing required and may also demonstrate a government's fiscal discipline to creditors and credit rating agencies and make borrowing easier and cheaper as a result.
In most macroeconomic models, austerity policies which reduce government spending lead to increased unemployment in the short term. These reductions in employment usually occur directly in the public sector and indirectly in the private sector. Where austerity policies are enacted using tax increases, these can reduce consumption by cutting household disposable income. Reduced government spending can reduce gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the short term as government expenditure is itself a component of GDP. In the longer term, reduced government spending can reduce GDP growth if, for example, cuts to education spending leave a country's workforce less able to do high-skilled jobs or if cuts to infrastructure investment impose greater costs on business than they saved through lower taxes. In both cases, if reduced government spending leads to reduced GDP growth, austerity may lead to a higher debt-to-GDP ratio than the alternative of the government running a higher budget deficit. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, austerity measures in many European countries were followed by rising unemployment and slower GDP growth. The result was increased debt-to-GDP ratios despite reductions in budget deficits.
Theoretically in some cases, particularly when the output gap is low, austerity can have the opposite effect and stimulate economic growth. For example, when an economy is operating at or near capacity, higher short-term deficit spending (stimulus) can cause interest rates to rise, resulting in a reduction in private investment, which in turn reduces economic growth. Where there is excess capacity, the stimulus can result in an increase in employment and output. Alberto Alesina, Carlo Favero, and Francesco Giavazzi argue that austerity can be expansionary in situations where government reduction in spending is offset by greater increases in aggregate demand (private consumption, private investment, and exports).

History
The origin of modern austerity measures is mostly undocumented among academics. During the United States occupation of Haiti that began in 1915, the United States utilized austerity policies where American co",politics
Ancient history,"Ancient history is a time period from the beginning of writing and recorded human history through late antiquity. The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with the development of Sumerian cuneiform script. Ancient history covers all continents inhabited by humans in the period 3000 BC – AD 500, ending with the expansion of Islam in late antiquity. The three-age system periodises ancient history into the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age, with recorded history generally considered to begin with the Bronze Age. The start and end of the three ages vary between world regions. In many regions the Bronze Age is generally considered to begin a few centuries prior to 3000 BC, while the end of the Iron Age varies from the early first millennium BC in some regions to the late first millennium AD in others.
During the time period of ancient history, the world population was already exponentially increasing due to the Neolithic Revolution, which was in full progress. While in 10,000 BC, the world population stood at 2 million, it rose to 45 million by 3000 BC. By the Iron Age in 1000 BC, the population had risen to 72 million. By the end of the ancient period in AD 500, the world population is thought to have stood at 209 million. In 10,500 years, the world population increased by 100 times.

Prehistory
Prehistory is the period before written history. Most of our knowledge of that period comes from the work of archaeologists.
The early human migrations in the Lower Paleolithic saw Homo erectus spread across Eurasia 1.8 million years ago. Evidence for the use of fire has been dated as early as 1.8 million years ago, a date which is contested, with generally accepted evidence for the controlled use of fire dating to 780,000 years ago. Actual use of hearths first appears 400,000 years ago. Dates for the emergence of Homo sapiens (modern humans) range from 250,000 to 160,000 years ago, with the varying dates being based on DNA studies and fossils respectively. Some 50,000 years ago, Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa. They reached Australia about 45,000 years ago, southwestern Europe about the same time, southeastern Europe and Siberia around 40,000 years ago, and Japan about 30,000 years ago. Humans migrated to the Americas about 15,000 years ago.
Evidence for agriculture emerges in about 9000 BC in what is now eastern Turkey and spread through the Fertile Crescent. Settlement at Göbekli Tepe began around 9500 BC and may have the world's oldest temple. The Nile River Valley has evidence of sorghum and millet cultivation starting around 8000 BC and agricultural use of yams in Western Africa perhaps dates to the same time period. Cultivation of millet, rice, and legumes began around 7000 BC in China. Taro cultivation in New Guinea dates to about 7000 BC also with squash cultivation in Mesoamerica perhaps sharing that date. Animal domestication began with the domestication of dogs, which dates to at least 15,000 years ago, and perh",history

Confocal endoscopy,"Confocal endoscopy, or confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), is a modern imaging technique that allows the examination of real-time microscopic and histological features inside the body. In the word ""endomicroscopy"", endo- means ""within"" and -skopein means ""to view or observe"". CLE, also known as ""optical biopsy"", can analyse histology and cytology features of a tissue which otherwise is only possible by tissue biopsy.
Similar to confocal microscopy, the laser in CLE filtered by the pinhole excites the fluorescent dye through a beam splitter and objective lens. The fluorescent emission then follows similar paths into the detector. A pinhole is used to select emissions from the desired focal plane. Two categories of CLE exist, namely probe-based (pCLE) and the less common endoscopy-based endoscopy (eCLE).
CLE can be intubated to study the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and accessory digestive organs with a fluorescent dye. A variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Barrett's oesophagus, can be diagnosed by the magnified and in-depth view in combination with traditional endoscopy.

Significance
CLE can identify the lesions with a small depths of view under the tissue, in contrast to the surface level in conventional endoscopy. It also allows clinicians to discriminate benign or malignant lesions through real-time histological diagnosis by revealing the properties of the lamina at a cellular level.
An example is Whipple's disease. Conventional endoscopy presents a whitish-patterned duodenal mucosa. CLE, in comparison, generates two images –– the superficial images show capillary leak in duodenal mucosa while the deep images show cells of duodenal mucosa, including goblet cells and foamy macrophages in lamina propria. Compared to histological examination of the same duodenal site after periodic acid-Schiff staining, CLE identifies similar patterns of goblet cells and foamy macrophages.

Types
Two types of CLE have been invented, namely probe-based (pCLE) and endoscope-based CLE (eCLE).

Probe-based CLE
pCLE, developed by Mauna Kea Technologies, is a fibre bundle transit through the 2.8 mm working channel (the hollow hole) of the standard endoscope into the GI tract. With a fixed plane of imaging, each fibre acts as a pinhole to filter unwanted noise. The frame rate lies between 9 and 12 images/second.

Endoscope-based CLE
eCLE, developed by Pentax, is a confocal microscopy fixed at the end of the endoscopic tube. The integrated machine of eCLE is larger than the pCLE in diameter, making GI tract endoscopic intubation more difficult. eCLE has ceased commercially due to the camera's inflexibility.

Medical uses
Oesophagus
CLE is effective in detecting premalignant, including Barrett's oesophagus, and malignant (cancerous) lesions in the upper GI tract. The modifications of mucosa shown in histopathology as an index of malignancy can be identified under CLE, such as high-grade dysplasia. CLE can also be implemented to refer to the",medicine
Telecommunications in Kazakhstan,"Telecommunications in Kazakhstan include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the internet.
The largest telecommunications company in Kazakhstan is Kazakhtelecom, which is responsible for infrastructure such as cables and exchanges, and provides internet, television and telephone connections to individuals and businesses. The state of Kazakhstan is a major shareholder in Kazakhtelecom.

Telephones
Telephone numbers
Kazakhstan's international calling code is +7, it is used in combination with the zone codes 6xx and 7xx. It is the only former Soviet country except Russia not yet to have transitioned away from +7, but that does not mean there were not attempts to switch their code. In 2021, the number +997 was allocated by the ITU, and was set in motion to be activated in 2023. However in early 2023, the country applied instead for the number +77 before finally deciding to keep +7.
Telephone numbers, both fixed and mobile, are 10 digits long.
Kazakhstan's telephone numbering system is structured with zone codes 6xx for fixed-line services and 7xx for mobile phone services. The country has several major telecom providers offering services ranging from fixed-line telephony to mobile and internet packages. The introduction of mobile number portability (MNP) has increased competition among operators by allowing users to switch carriers without changing their phone numbers.
Efforts to improve telecommunications infrastructure have led to expanded 4G coverage in urban areas, with pilot projects for 5G networks being tested in cities such as Almaty, Astana, and Shymkent. Government initiatives also aim to improve connectivity in rural and remote areas as part of a national push to bridge the digital divide.

Fixed-line
Telephone density of fixed telephone subscriptions is decreasing, standing at 16 per 100 people in 2021, compared to its peak of 26 per 100 in 2012.

Mobile
As of 2021, there were estimated to be over 24 million cellular subscriptions; 127 per 100 inhabitants of Kazakhstan.

Kazakhstan has 4G mobile internet and has begun work on 5G as of 2021.

Satellite
Kazakhstan's national DAMA satellite communication network was established in 1999 in order to provide communication services to sparsely populated areas with poor road access.

Wushu (sport),"Wushu (traditional Chinese: 武術; simplified Chinese: 武术; pinyin: wǔshù) (), or kung fu, is a competitive Chinese martial art. It integrates concepts and forms from various traditional and modern Chinese martial arts, including Shaolin kung fu, tai chi, and Wudangquan. ""Wushu"" is the Chinese term for ""martial arts"" (武 ""Wu"" = combat or martial, 術 ""Shu"" = art), reflecting the art's goal as a compilation and standardization of various styles. To distinguish it from Traditional Chinese Martial Arts, it is sometimes referred to as 'Modern Wushu'. 
Wushu is practiced both through forms, called taolu, and as a full-contact combat sport, known as sanda.  It has a long history of Chinese martial arts and was developed in 1949 to standardize the practice of traditional Chinese martial arts, though attempts to structure the various decentralized martial arts traditions date back earlier when the Central Guoshu Institute was established at Nanjing in 1928.
In contemporary times, wushu has become an international sport under the International Wushu Federation (IWUF), which holds the World Wushu Championships every two years. Wushu is an official event at the Asian Games, East Asian Youth Games, Southeast Asian Games, World Combat Games, and in various other multi-sport events.

History
History and Etymology of the Term 'Wushu'
Traditional Chinese Martial Arts have existed for thousands of years. The earliest term for 'Martial Arts', which can be found in the Han History (206BC-23CE), was ""Military Fighting Techniques"" (兵技巧; bīng jìqiǎo). During the Song period (circa 960CE) the name changed to ""martial arts"" (武藝; Wǔ Yì). The term 'Wushu' ('Martial Arts') was also occasionally used. The term 'Wushu' was, for example, found in a poem by Cheng Shao (1626–1644) from the Ming dynasty. In 1928 the 'officially sanctioned' name was changed to ""national arts"" (國術; guóshù) when the National Martial Arts Academy was established in Nanjing. The term reverted to Wushu under the People's Republic of China during the early 1950s.

The word Wǔ (武) means ""Martial"" and  is composed of two parts:  “walk” or “stop” (止; zhǐ) and  “lance” (戈; gē). The term wushu being used for 'martial arts' goes back as far as the Liang Dynasty (502–557) in an anthology compiled by Xiao Tong (蕭通), (Prince Zhaoming; 昭明太子 d. 531), called ""Selected Literature"" (文選; Wénxuǎn). The term is found in the second verse of a poem by Yan Yanzhi titled: Huang Taizi Shidian Hui Zuoshi (皇太子釋奠會作詩).The great man grows the many myriad things . . .

History of the Martial Sport of Wushu
Wushu, as a 'martial sport', was created by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the 20th Century. This was part of an over-arching social, cultural and political movement lead by that Party, to modernize China as it saw fit. In 1958CE, the CCP government established an organization for martial arts training. The Chinese State Commission for Physical Cultu",sports
Kangchu system,"The Kangchu system was a socio-economic system of organisation and administration developed by Chinese agricultural settlers in Johor during the 19th century. The settlers organised themselves into informal associations (similar to the Kongsi organisations found in other Chinese communities), and chose a leader from among themselves.
In Chinese, ""Kangchu"" (Chinese: 港主; Hokkien Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Káng-chú; Teochew Pe̍h-ūe-jī: Káng-tsú) literally means ‘master of the riverbank’, and was the title given to the Chinese headmen of these river settlements. The ""Kangchu"" leaders are also called ""Kapitan"".
The Kangchu system traces its origins from the 18th century when Chinese coolies settled in Penang and Riau and set up gambier and pepper plantations there. The sovereign rulers of Johor, Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim and his son and successor, Sultan Abu Bakar, took up the Kangchu system during the first half of the 19th century to provide a more organised form of administration as Chinese immigrants began to settle in the state in great numbers and developed the state's agricultural economy.
The term ""Kangchu"" became widely used during the 19th century, as Chinese immigrants began to settle in and around Johor state and set up gambier and pepper plantations. The social and economic welfare of the early Chinese settlers came under the charge of local Chinese leaders, who were responsible for running these agricultural plantations, which were situated along the river banks.  In 1917, the British colonial government in Johor implemented an act which abolished the Kangchu system in the state, and the value for gambier declined during the early 20th century.
Variants of the Kangchu system thrived in other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, where gambier and pepper were cultivated and where there were significant Chinese populations. The Kangchu and coolies who worked in the gambier and pepper plantations were mainly of Teochew origin, and were generally first- or second-generation Chinese immigrants.

History
Early years
The origins of the Kangchu system dates back to the mid-18th century, when early Chinese settlers in Penang experimented in cash crop plantations with various types of crops, including pepper, gambier, betelnut and clove. The plantations were abandoned by the late 18th-century, as Penang experienced wars from Buginese seafarers that resulted in many gambier plantations being destroyed; contributing to the decline in plantations was the growing popularity of the spice trade that reaped much greater profits. At the beginning of the 19th century, these Chinese settlers began to look south to Malacca and Singapore, where gambier and pepper plantations had also been established.
In the late 1820s, Chinese settlers from Singapore also began to look towards Johor for gambier and pepper cultivation at the encouragement of Temenggong Abdul Rahman and his successor, Daeng Ibrahim. As more Chinese settlers established gambier and pepper plantations in Johor duri",economics
Telecommunications in Macau,"With Macau's small population (about 680,000) and market, only a few local media options are available for the local people. Because radio signals, newspapers and magazines from Hong Kong are available in Macau, the local media are always a minority group in terms of sales and number of viewers.

Newspapers
There are eighteen newspapers (twelve in Chinese, four in Portuguese and two in English). O Mun Yat Po or Macau Daily News) is owned by the Chinese Communist Party and has the largest circulation (4,000). Additionally, Chinese-language newspapers from Hong Kong are popular.
Macau has eight Chinese-language, three Portuguese-language and two English-language dailies. The Macau Daily Times is Macau's only English-language newspaper edited seven days a week. Macau Post Daily is published from Monday to Friday. It is owned by a local publishing company, Everbright Co. Ltd., which is locally owned.

Radio
There are 250,000 radios; two twenty-hour FM radio stations, one Portuguese, one Chinese; and four AM stations. Hong Kong radio stations also are popular in Macau.

Swamp football,"Swamp football (sometimes called Swamp soccer, and Suopotkupallo in Finnish) is a form of association football that is played in bogs or swamps. The sport originated in Finland, where it initially was used as an exercise for athletes and soldiers due to the strength needed to move through a bog. Swamp football is especially popular in the Kainuu region. The swamp football world championship is held annually at Hyrynsalmi, Kainuu. The first organized championship was the 1998 Finnish championship. There are currently an estimated 300 swamp football teams around the world.
The officially recognized global body for Swamp Football is Swamp Soccer UK Ltd, based in Scotland. Swamp Soccer UK's mission is to introduce the sport to other countries, primarily by organizing the Swamp Soccer World Cup. From 2011 to 2015, official tournaments have been launched in China (Beijing), Turkey (Istanbul) and India (Mumbai), led by Stewart Miller.

Swamp football in the UK
Swamp Soccer in the UK was managed by Swamp Soccer UK Ltd, headed by Stewart Miller.
The annual tournament ran from 2004 to 2015. At its peak, when FRijj (Muller) was the title sponsor, the event attracted over 100 teams from 25 countries. Other event sponsors have included Ardbeg (part of LVMH group), Springbank Distillery, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, SealSkinz, and many others 
The World Cup event in Scotland attracted global media coverage.
The world cup event was moved to Istanbul in Turkey in 2016
Stewart Miller now organizes exhibition games for brands, television programs and key intermediaries.

Rules
The standard football rules have been modified significantly to suit the more demanding sport:

The game is played in two halves of 12 to 13 minutes
Corner kicks, penalties, and throw-ins are made by dropping the ball on to a chosen foot
There is no offside rule
There are 6 players on the field, with no limit on the size of squads
The players can be substituted as often as necessary
The World Cup is held in Scotland annually, usually on the last weekend in June
The World Championship is held in Finland annually, usually in the middle of June a week before the World Cup
The penalty area is five meters deep, but the goalkeeper is only allowed to hold the ball in a three meter radius from the goal.

Poison exon,"Poison exons (PEs); also called premature termination codon (PTC) exons or nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) exons] are a class of cassette exons that contain PTCs. Inclusion of a PE in a transcript targets the transcript for degradation via NMD. PEs are generally highly conserved elements of the genome and are thought to have important regulatory roles in biology. Targeting PE inclusion or exclusion in certain transcripts is being evaluated as a therapeutic strategy.

Discovery
In 2002, a model termed regulated unproductive splicing and translation (RUST) was proposed based on the finding that many (~one-third) alternatively spliced transcripts contain PEs. In this model, coupling alternative splicing to NMD (AS-NMD) is thought to tune transcript levels to regulate protein expression. Alternative splicing may also lead to NMD via other pathways besides PE inclusion, e.g., intron retention.
PEs were initially characterized in RNA-binding proteins from the SR protein family. Genes for other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) such as those for heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) also contain PEs. Numerous chromatin regulators also contain PEs, though these are less conserved than PEs within RBPs such as the SR proteins. Multiple spliceosomal components contain PEs. Certain PEs may occur only in specific tissues.
PE-containing transcripts generally represent a minority of the overall transcript population, in part due to their active degradation via NMD, though this relative abundance can be elevated upon inhibition of NMD or certain biological states. Certain PE-containing transcripts are resistant to NMD and may be translated into truncated proteins.

Regulation
Cis-regulatory elements neighboring PEs have been found to affect PE inclusion.
Many proteins whose corresponding genes contain PEs autoregulate PE inclusion in their respective transcripts and thereby control their own levels via a feedback loop. Cross-regulation of PE inclusion has also been observed.
Differential splicing of PEs is implicated in biological processes such as differentiation, neurodevelopment, dispersal of nuclear speckles during hypoxia, tumorigenesis, organism growth, and T cell expansion.
Protein kinases that regulate phosphorylation of splicing factors can affect splicing processes, thus kinase inhibitors may affect inclusion of PEs. For example, CMGC kinase inhibitors and CDK9 inhibitors have been found to induce PE inclusion in RBM39.
Small molecules that modulate chromatin accessibility can affect PE inclusion.
Mutations in splicing factors can lead to inclusion of PEs in certain transcripts.
PE inclusion can be regulated by external variables such as temperature and electrical activity. For example, PE inclusion in RBM3 transcript is lowered during hypothermia. This is mediated by temperature-dependent binding of the splicing factor HNRNPH1 to the RBM3 transcript. The neuronal RBPs NOVA1/2 are translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during pilocarpine-induc",medicine
Outline of history,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to history:
History – discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented (the beginning of recorded history).

Nature of history
History can be described as all of the following:

Academic discipline – body of knowledge given to – or received by – a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
one of the humanities – academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
Field of science  – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer-reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
Social science  – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

Essence of history
Chronology – science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time, such as in historical timelines.
Past – totality of events which occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. The past is the domain of history.
Time – measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. History describes what happened where, but also when (in time) those events took place.

Historical disciplines
Archaeology – study of past human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data
Archontology – study of historical offices and important positions in state, international, political, religious and other organizations and societies
Art history – study of changes in and social context of art
Chronology – locating events in time
Cultural history – study of culture in the past
Diplomatic history – study of the historical foreign policy and diplomacy of states
History of science – study of the emergence and development of scientific inquiry
Economic history – the study of economics in the past
Environmental history – study of natural history and the human relationship with the natural world
Futurology – study of the future: researches the medium to long-term future of societies and of the physical world

Drone-Enhanced Emergency Medical Services,"Drone-enhanced Emergency Medical Services (DEMS) involve the use of highly autonomous Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drones to deliver critical medical supplies, such as Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), life-saving medications, and remote diagnostic equipment, directly to emergency situations. This innovative approach is gaining traction globally, as it significantly reduces response times, thereby improving patient outcomes in time-sensitive scenarios like cardiac arrests and other emergencies where every second counts.
The evolution of drone technology in EMS has been fueled by advancements in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and the growing recognition of their capabilities in addressing logistical challenges, particularly in remote or underserved areas. Initial trials in the early 2010s laid the groundwork for delivering medical supplies, while subsequent pilot programs have focused on specialized applications, including rapid delivery of emergency medical equipment and live video feeds to support first responders before their arrival at the scene. Despite the promising benefits of drone-enhanced EMS, some challenges remain, including public acceptance, regulatory hurdles, and the technological complexity of integrating these systems into existing emergency response frameworks. As healthcare organizations seek innovative solutions to improve emergency medical responses, addressing these challenges will be crucial.

History
However, their versatility has led to a broader range of use cases, including EMS.

Early developments
The use of drones for healthcare logistics can be traced back to early trials in the 2010s, which focused on delivering medical supplies to remote areas, aiming to address logistical challenges such as extreme weather, natural disasters, and limited transport infrastructure. These early implementations demonstrated the potential for drones to significantly improve medical delivery efficiency, particularly in emergencies where time is critical.

Expansion into Emergency medicine
As drone technology matured, EMS began to explore more specialized applications. By the mid-2010s, pilot programs were developed to test drones for the delivery of critical medical supplies, such as Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), particularly for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases. These programs often involved collaboration between healthcare providers, technology developers, and regulatory agencies to ensure safety and operational compliance.

Future directions
Today, drones are increasingly being integrated into EMS, with applications ranging from rapid assessment of emergency situations to delivering medical supplies like AEDs and medical supplies and remote diagnostic equipment. The potential of drone technology continues to expand as regulatory frameworks evolve, and ongoing research promises further innovations in the field.

National Agricultural Policy Center,"The National Agricultural Policy Center (NAPC) (Arabic: المركز الوطني للسياسات الزراعية), was established in 2000 through the work of the Project GCP/SYR/006/ITA of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, funded by the Government of Italy, to be part of the Syrian Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform. The project is now in its third phase. It is a center of research and analysis in the field of agricultural policies in Syria, and therefore strives to provide policy analysis for relevant stakeholders and policymakers in the field.

History
The FAO Project GCP/SYR/006/ITA started in April 1998, and sought to respond to the Government of Syria's initiative to move from a socially planned economy to a social market economy. After background work and training from the Project the NAPC was established in 2000 as part of the Project's first phase (April 1998 - October 2001). In the second phase (November 2001 - October 2004) of the Project training was delivered to the now fully staffed NAPC, an organizational structure was developed and a mid-term work-plan established. In third phase (November 2004 - October 2007), the Project assisted in consolidating the work of the NAPC with a view to its future independence and sustainability.

Establishment Aims
To meet the long as well as short-term needs of decision-makers for in-depth and rigorous analysis for policy options on issues of relevance. Including:

undertaking policy analysis studies enabling the formulation of integrated, coherent and effective agricultural strategies and policies
suggesting policy directives to help relieve and overcome agricultural problems and constraints
preparing and publishing policy studies and reports to enable the integration of the agricultural sector within the economy
conducting training courses with a view to helping in the capacity building in policy analysis and planning within the Syrian Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform and other related Ministries and Institutions.

NAPC Structure and Focus Areas
The NAPC is divided into four different divisions, each with a specific mandate related to the subject of agricultural policy analysis in Syria. These divisions are as follows: Trade Policy (TPD), Agro-Food (AFD), Rural Development (RDD) and Information and Communications (InfoCom). The focus areas of each division can be given as follows:

Michael Hargrave,"Michael John Hargrave (8 December 1923 – 25 July 1974) was a British general practitioner  in Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, who in 1945 assisted British Army occupation forces at the recently-liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp when he volunteered as a medical student from Westminster Hospital at the age of 21.
After graduating in medicine in 1947, Hargrave took a house job at Westminster Hospital after which he completed his national service with the Royal Air Force in Egypt and Kenya. Upon returning to Wootton Bassett in 1950, he became a general practitioner and a clinical assistant to the ear, nose and throat clinic at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Swindon. By 1956, he had a purpose-built surgery with an appointment system and radiotelephone.
His memoirs, written for his mother, were used by historian Ben Shephard in his 2005 book After Daybreak: The Liberation of Belsen, 1945, and were published by Imperial College Press in 2014, in a book titled Bergen-Belsen 1945: A Medical Student's Journal.

Early life
Michael Hargrave was born on 8 December 1923, in Simla, British India, the elder of two sons of a decorated First World War pilot who was posted there by the Royal Air Force. Hargrave was sent to England to attend Harcourt Preparatory School at Weyhill, following which he attended St Edward's School, Oxford. In 1942, he gained admission to King's College London and then to Westminster Hospital for his clinical education in medicine.

Belsen
Hargrave had, until May 1945, spent the Second World War at school and studying medicine. In April 1945, he was among eleven medical students from Westminster who volunteered to help relieve a famine in Holland, a part of the Netherlands still occupied by the Germans but awaiting liberation. On the day of departure, the students were informed that they were instead being sent to help at the recently liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.
At Belsen, army medics were trying to prevent the spread of disease and save those they could. Hargrave described in his daily journal the process by which the huts in Camp One were cleaned, disinfected and turned into basic temporary hospitals, after which its inmates were cleaned, disinfected and then moved out. He led this process in hut 210 and performed treatments including the excision of eyelid cysts and tuberculous glands in the neck. He became accustomed to seeing boils, gangrene, diarrhoea, typhus and severe malnutrition. Supervision and briefings were given by nutritionist Arnold Peter Meiklejohn, Brigadier Hugh Glyn-Hughes and Colonel James Johnston. Hargrave also taught a Polish girl, Zosia Wiśniowska, how to speak English.

Career
In 1947, Hargrave graduated in medicine and took up his first house job at Westminster Hospital.

"History of Lagos, Portugal","Lagos is a city in the District of Faro, in Portugal. According to tradition, the city was founded about 2,000 years before the Birth of Christ, having been under rule by the Carthaginians, Romans and Muslims. After the Christian reconquest, it played a leading role in the Portuguese Discoveries, becoming the main city in the Algarve, a position it lost to Faro after the devastating earthquake of 1755. Recovery was hampered by the French invasions and the Portuguese Civil War, only regaining some importance in the mid-19th century, with the development of industries, mainly canning. After World War II, a phase of replacement of industrial activities by tourism is witnessed, whose economic importance marks the transition to the Third Millennium.

Prehistory and early colonization
The human presence in the territory that would later become Portugal began in the Lower Paleolithic, as can be proven by the remains of a pre-Acheulean lithic industry. During the Stone Age there was already a rudimentary fishing activity on the Lagos coast, using hooks made from deer antlers, which were found by archaeologist Estácio da Veiga in caves. It is estimated that at that time there were a large number of deer in the region, as more tools made from the antlers have been found, and which were used for harvesting and sowing wheat, barley, vegetables, etc... Until the Roman conquest, boats made of leather were used for fishing, as hides for waterproofing, and with masts made of thin wood, so that they were easy to bend and thus not damaged by the wind. The products of the Lagos fishery, especially tuna and sardines, which were exported salted, became very famous during the ancient civilizations, and were part of the trade between Turdetania and North Africa. The historian Faria e Castro reported that in his time there were still traces of the great fisheries that took place in antiquity, especially of tuna, which was transported in brine to Carthage, where it was highly appreciated. To confirm this theory, Faria e Castro cited several ancient authors, such as Athenaeus, Pliny and Strabo, who claimed that tuna fishing was already quite old on the coast of Lusitania. The historian also mentioned that the transport of salted fish even reached Greece, during the time of Hippocrates. One of the known habits of sailors was to sacrifice a tuna to the god Neptune, when the fishing was very abundant.
During the period before the Christian era, the Iberian Peninsula was inhabited mainly by the Iberian people, and invaded by the Celts in the 4th century BC, who eventually merged into the Celtiberians. According to tradition, in about 1899 BC, a settlement called Lacobriga was founded in the area where present-day Lagos is located, although the location of this urban nucleus has not been completely determined, with Fonte Coberta, Serro da Amendoeira, Paúl, Figueira da Misericórdia, and Monte Molião having been put forward as hypotheses, the latter being considered the most pro",history

The No. 1 Armoured Train
During World War II, the Canadian high command implemented this armoured train for protection of the Canadian National Railway line between Prince Rupert, an important naval port for the Aleutian Island campaign, and Terrace, from potential attack by Japanese aircraft, submarines/gunboats, and infantry.  The train eventually was composed of a gondola with a WWI-era 75mm gun and searchlight, a gondola with two 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns, a troop boxcar, a kitchen car, and a steam locomotive, with all the cars outfitted with armour.  A diesel engine was also experimentally outfitted with armoured plate but by the time it was finished, the train had been taken out of service as the Japanese threat was no longer an issue.

Toad Day Out,"Toad Day Out is a pest control event which takes place in Queensland, Australia on the 29 March of each year. Its focus is to reduce the population of the invasive cane toad. The toads are caught live and unharmed. The day was originally advocated by politician Shane Knuth. Toads are captured and taken to be humanely destroyed. Prizes are awarded for children who find the heaviest toads, and schools which capture the most toads (by weight). Before they are destroyed, the toads are inspected, weighed and bagged. They are euthanized via exposure to CO₂ gas, ensuring a quick and painless death. Most end up being turned into fertilizer, some are used for research, and a few have been stuffed by taxidermists.
The cane toad has been a pest since it was introduced to Australia in 1935  by farmers who hoped the toad would control the spread of the cane beetle. As of 2018, no national eradication program has been implemented due to a lack of resources and technology.
Toad Day Out has been held since 2009. The event was inspired by an episode of The Simpsons called ""Whacking Day"".

History of Santa Catalina Island,"The history of human activity on Santa Catalina Island, California begins with the American Indians who had inhabited the island since 7000 BC. The first European colonists to arrive on Catalina claimed it for the Spanish Empire. Over the years, territorial claims to the island transferred to Mexico and then to the United States. During this time, the island was sporadically used for smuggling, otter hunting, and gold-digging. Catalina was successfully developed into a tourist destination by chewing gum magnate William Wrigley, Jr. beginning in the 1920s, with most of the activity centered around the only incorporated city of Avalon, California. Since the 1970s, most of the island has been administered by the Catalina Island Conservancy.

Pre-Columbian settlement
Prior to the modern era, the island was inhabited by people of the Gabrielino/Tongva tribe, who, having had villages near present-day San Pedro and Playa del Rey, regularly traveled back and forth to Catalina for trade. Archeological evidence shows Pimugnan settlement beginning in 5000 BC. The Pimugnans had settlements all over the island at one time or another, with their biggest villages being at the Isthmus and at present-day Avalon, Shark/Little Harbor, and Emerald Bay. The Pimugnans (also known as Tongva) were renowned for their mining, working and trade of soapstone which was found in great quantities and varieties on the island. This material was in great demand to make stone vessels for cooking and was traded along the California coast.
Archaeologists have learned much about these tribes from middens, ancient dumps where they tossed everything they no longer needed. These middens can today be identified by mounds of crumbled abalone shells. It is estimated that there are over 2,000 middens on Catalina Island, only half of which have been discovered. Evidence from these middens indicate that around 2000 BCE as many as 2,500 lived on Catalina Island.

European explorers
The first European to set foot on the island was the Portuguese explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who sailed in the name of the Spanish crown.  On October 7, 1542, he claimed the island for Spain and christened it San Salvador after his ship (Catalina has also been identified as one of the many possible burial sites for Cabrillo). Over half a century later, another Spanish explorer, Sebastián Vizcaíno, rediscovered the island on the eve of Saint Catherine's day (November 24) in 1602.  Vizcaino renamed the island in the saint's honor.
The colonization of California by the Spanish coincided with the decline of the Pimugnans. They suffered from the introduction of new diseases to which they had little immunity and the disruption of their trade and social networks caused by the establishment of the California missions.

Agricultural & Applied Economics Association,"The Agricultural and Applied Economics Association (AAEA) is a professional association of people working in agricultural and applied economics.

History
In 1910, the American Farm Management Association was founded at Iowa State University. In 1919, ithe association was renamed the American Farm Economics Association. In 1968, a group left the organization and formed the American Agricultural Economics Association. The organisation was later renamed the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association.
The association holds an annual meeting. The Journal of the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association was launched in 2021.
Fellows of the association include Scott H. Irwin and Elisabeth Sadoulet.

Journals
The association publishes three journals, all of which are published by Wiley:

Carthaginian peace,"A Carthaginian peace is the imposition of a very brutal peace intended to permanently cripple the losing side. The term derives from the peace terms imposed on the Carthaginian Empire by the Roman Republic following the Punic Wars. After the Second Punic War, Carthage lost all its colonies, was forced to demilitarize, paid a constant tribute to Rome and was barred from waging war without Rome's permission. At the end of the Third Punic War, the Romans systematically burned Carthage to the ground and enslaved its population.

Origin
The term was popularized by the 20th century economist John Maynard Keynes.
The term refers to the outcome of a series of wars between Rome and the Phoenician city of Carthage, known as the Punic Wars. The two empires fought three separate wars against each other, beginning in 264 BC and ending in 146 BC.
At the end of the Third Punic War, the Romans laid siege to Carthage. When they took the city, they killed most of the inhabitants, sold the rest into slavery, and destroyed the entire city. There is no ancient evidence for modern accounts that the Romans sowed the ground with salt.
By extension, a Carthaginian peace can refer to any brutal peace treaty demanding total subjugation of the defeated side.

Modern use
Modern use of the term is often extended to any peace settlement in which the peace terms are overly harsh and designed to accentuate and perpetuate the inferiority of the loser. Thus, after World War I, many (the economist John Maynard Keynes among them) described the so-called peace brought about by the Treaty of Versailles as a ""Carthaginian peace.""
The Morgenthau Plan put forward after World War II has also been described as a Carthaginian peace, as it advocated the deindustrialization of Germany. It was intended to severely curb the influence of German power in the region and to prevent its remilitarization, as had occurred after World War I (German rearmament and the Remilitarization of the Rhineland).  The Morgenthau Plan was dropped in favor of the Marshall Plan (1948–1952), which entailed the rebuilding of Western European infrastructure, particularly in West Germany.
General Lucius D. Clay, a deputy to General Dwight D. Eisenhower and, in 1945, Military Governor of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany, would later remark that ""there was no doubt that JCS 1067 contemplated the Carthaginian peace which dominated our operations in Germany during the early months of occupation. This is while the US was following the Morgenthau Plan."" Clay would later replace Eisenhower as governor and as commander-in-chief in Europe. The Marshall Plan was favored as a revival of the West German economy was considered to be necessary for the recovery of the economy of Europe. West Germany was regarded as a key bulwark against the Eastern Bloc.

Telecommunications in Jordan,"Jordan has a highly developed communications infrastructure. Jordan's telecom infrastructure is growing at a very rapid pace and continually being updated and expanded. Communications in Jordan occur across many media, including telephone, radio, television, and internet.

Telephone
50% of households have at least one main line telephone. As of 2010, 103% of the population has a cell phone; 15% have more than one.

Telephones - main lines in use: 622,600 (as of 2003)
Telephones - mobile cellular: 6,250,000 (as of September 2010)
Digital Radio Trunking:100,000 (Unofficial, Nov'07)
In mid 2004, XPress Telecom was launched as the country's digital radio trunking operator.

Telephone system: The service has improved recently with the increased use of digital switching equipment, but better access to the telephone system is needed in some rural areas and easier access to pay telephones is needed by the urban public.
domestic: Microwave radio relay transmission and coaxial and fiber-optic cable are employed on trunk lines; considerable use is made of mobile cellular systems; Internet service is available.
international: satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat, 1 Arabsat, and 29 land and maritime Inmarsat terminals; fiber-optic cable to Saudi Arabia and microwave radio relay link with Egypt and Syria; connection to international submarine cable FLAG (Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe); participant in MEDARABTEL; international links total about 4,000.

Television broadcast stations: 20 (plus 96 repeaters) (as of 1995)
Televisions: 500,000 (as of 1997)

PCs
40% of Jordanian households have a PC.  This is expected to double in the coming years when the government reduces the sales tax on PCs and internet service in an effort to make Jordan the high-tech capital of the Middle East.  The Jordanian Government is also providing every university student with a laptop in partnership with the private sector.  All Jordan's schools are connected with internet service and the Jordanian Government is heavily purchasing computers and smart technology to be equipped in Jordan's classrooms.

Internet
As of 2013, Internet penetration in Jordan was 63%. It was 50.5 percent by the end of 2011. Internet usage more than doubled from 2007 to 2009 with the rapid growth expected to continue. Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) figures indicate that Internet penetration stood at 29 per cent by the end of 2009 and 38 per cent by the end of 2010.
The Jordanian government has announced that the sales tax on computers and internet connection would be removed in order to further stimulate the ICT industry in Jordan. King Abdullah II told the BBC in 2004 that he hoped to make his country the tech hub of the Middle East. Jordan has more internet start up companies than any other country in the Middle East, and thus was dubbed the Middle",technology
Economic methodology,"Economic methodology is the study of methods, especially the  scientific method,  in relation to economics,  including principles underlying economic reasoning.  In contemporary English, 'methodology' may reference  theoretical or systematic aspects of a method (or several methods). Philosophy and economics also takes up methodology at the intersection of the two subjects.

Scope
General methodological issues include similarities and contrasts to the natural sciences and to other social sciences and, in particular, to:

the definition of economics
the scope of economics as defined by its methods
fundamental principles and operational significance of economic theory
methodological individualism versus holism in economics
the role of simplifying assumptions such as rational choice and profit maximizing in explaining or predicting phenomena
descriptive/positive, prescriptive/normative, and applied uses of theory
the scientific status and expanding domain of economics
issues critical to the practice and progress of econometrics
the balance of empirical and philosophical approaches
the role of experiments in economics
the role of mathematics and mathematical economics in economics
the writing and rhetoric of economics
the relation between theory, observation, application, and methodology in contemporary economics.
Economic methodology has gone from periodic reflections of economists on method to a distinct research field in economics since the 1970s. In one direction, it has expanded to the boundaries of philosophy, including the relation of economics to the philosophy of science and the theory of knowledge. In another direction of philosophy and economics, additional subjects are treated including decision theory and ethics.

Dance science,"Dance science is the scientific study of dance and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance. Its aims are the enhancement of performance, the reduction of injury, and the improvement of well-being and health.

Overview
Dance medicine and science as a field of study developed in the 1970s and '80s out of the field of sports medicine. In the early 1980s, the American Dance Festival (ADF) started including dance medicine courses in their coursework for dancers. When ADF moved to Duke University, physicians from Duke University Hospital became interested in dancers. Then, in 1990, the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science (IADMS) was formed by an international group of dance medicine practitioners, dance educators, dance scientists, and dancers. Membership of IADMS began with 48 members in 1991, and has grown to over 900 members in 35 countries as of 2016.
Dance science as an academic discipline has been evolving over the past 20 years. In the United Kingdom, three degrees (at master's level) now exist: one at the University of Bedfordshire, one at the University of Wolverhampton, and one at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London. With regards to dance research, another UK institution which has staff and students active in the area is the University of Birmingham. Some undergraduate degrees in dance, or other dance courses, also include one or several modules in dance science, with the aim of promoting healthy dance practices. These include the University of Wolverhampton, the Royal Academy of Dance, and Bird College.
Several universities in the United States also offer dance science courses as part of their dance curriculum, accommodating both undergraduate and graduate-level students. These include, but are not limited to: Cornish College of the Arts, Columbia College of Chicago, California State - Long Beach, Elon University, Florida State University, Goucher College, Long Island University - Brooklyn Campus, Ohio State University, Ohio University, Texas A&M University, UCLA - Irvine, University of Colorado, University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign, the University of Oregon, and the University of South Florida.
Typically, the subject areas within dance science are similar to those studied in ""sports science"", though naturally with a focus on dance and the special considerations that this involves. They include: physiology, anatomy, kinesiology, psychology, biomechanics, nutrition, and similar. However, unlike sports science, dance science sometimes also studies related topics such as creativity and somatic techniques, including the practices of Pilates, yoga, Alexander technique, Feldenkrais method, etc.
Some dance companies employ dance scientists to provide support services, such as physiological testing, psychological support, conditioning and nutritional counseling. Such professionals include physical therapists, nutritionists, pilates instructors, massage therapi",science
Palin (game),"Palin (Mapuche: palin, Spanish: palín) is a traditional game of the Mapuche people of South America. It is broadly similar to field hockey, with two teams using sticks to move a ball across a goal line defended by their opponents. The Spanish conquistadors called it chueca, because it resembled a Spanish game of that name. Palin is the only pre-Columbian Mapuche game that has survived into the present day.

History
Nineteenth-century scholars, such as Chilean historian Diego Barros Arana, believed that the Spanish had introduced the game of chueca to the Mapuche. However, more recent scholarship indicates that palin was already widely played by the Mapuche when the Spanish first conquered the region, and was most likely an ancient indigenous custom that the Spanish named after the similar game from their own homeland.
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, palin was often played for ritual purposes or as preparation for warfare. Because of these associations, the Spanish colonial government of Chile repeatedly banned palin during the 17th and 18th centuries, but it was revived when Chile gained independence in the early 19th century. In more recent times it has been played primarily as a recreational sport, although some communities still hold palin games as a ritual for special occasions and other social gatherings.

Description
Palin is played by two opposing teams on a long, narrow, rectangular field on flat ground. Exact dimensions vary, but a typical field would be 200 meters long and 12 meters wide. The number of players on the teams can vary, as long both teams are of equal size.
Play begins with a wood or leather ball placed in the center of the field. Players use curved wooden sticks to move the ball down the long axis of the field and across the goal line on the opposing team's side. Score is kept as the difference in goals between the two teams. Each goal is worth one point, and when the trailing team makes a goal, a point is deducted from score of the team in the lead. A team must score four consecutive unanswered points to win a game.
Players often make strong physical contact as they maneuver for control of the ball; injuries during a game are common.

Beach racing,"Beach racing is a motorsport offshoot of enduro and motocross racing. As the name implies, riders on solo motorcycles, quad bikes, or sidecar combinations compete on a course marked out on a beach, often with man made jumps and sand dunes being constructed to make the course tougher. 
Beach races are usually held annually, generally at seaside resorts with large beaches. Typically, beach races follow the format of hare scrambles, with riders competing on a circuit of 1–3 miles (1.5–5 km) in length, usually for a time period of 1–3 hours. 
Due to their unique nature, beach races tend to be very popular with riders and spectators, with some of the larger races attracting several hundred riders. However beach racing is known to be very tough on motorcycles, small sand particles can damage wheel bearings, chains and sprockets, and the soft, sandy surface increases the demand on engines and clutches. 
Beach races are generally held in early spring or late autumn. This is because seasonal tourist trade at seaside resorts is low during these periods, there is more space for riders and competitors to park, and local authorities are more willing to allow their beaches to be closed off and used as a motorcycle course, due to the extra trade brought by riders, families and spectators.

Popular beach races
Sellicks Beach, South Australia has organised motorcycle racing on the beach and was held as early as 1917 with annual speed trials being held during summer until 1953 and with re-enactments in both 1986 and 1992.  Annual racing resumed in 2017 after a 20 year period of no activity.
The Enduropale (formerly named the Enduro du Touquet) has been held every spring since 1975 at the seaside town of Le Touquet with some 1,000 motorbikes, Quad bikes and 250,000 spectators. The event attracts riders and spectators from across Europe.
From 1981 to 1991 the Veronica Beach Race was held in Scheveningen, The Netherlands. The event which features quad, sidecar and motorbikes races was broadcast in more than 15 countries. Since 2006 the Red Bull Knock Out beach race will take place in Scheveningen, only for motorbikes. New Red Bull Knock Out editions are scheduled in 2018, 2020 and 2022.
Beach races are popular in the United Kingdom, and one of the most famous beach races is the Weston Beach Race, (previously known as the Weston Enduro) held on Weston-super-Mare beach in Somerset. The event which features quad, sidecar, solo and junior races, has been held since 1983, and regularly attracts entries of over 1,000 riders, with crowds of up to 100,000 watching the event over the weekend. In addition to Weston Beach Race the Amateur Motor Cycle Association run the Skegness Beach Race, this event attracts 25,000 spectators over the weekend.
Beach races are held each year from October to March in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire on the east coast of England. The events, organised by the Mablethorpe Sandracing Club, cover a number of different solo and quad classes. A beach race is",sports
Freedom fighter,"A freedom fighter is a person engaged in a struggle to achieve political freedom, particularly against an established government. The term is typically reserved for those who are actively involved in armed or otherwise violent rebellion.

Terminology
Generally speaking, freedom fighters are people who use physical force to cause a change in the political and or social order. Notable examples include uMkhonto we Sizwe in South Africa, the Sons of Liberty in the American Revolution, the Irish Republican Army in Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front in Eritrea, the Mukti Bahini in Bangladesh Liberation War, and the National Resistance Army in Uganda, which were considered freedom fighters by supporters. However, a person who is campaigning for freedom through peaceful means may still be classed as a freedom fighter, though in common usage they are called political activists, as in the case of the Black Consciousness Movement. In India, ""Freedom fighter"" is an officially recognized category by the Indian government covering those who took part in the country's independence movement; people in this category, which can also include dependant family members, get pensions and other benefits like special railway counters.
People who are described as ""freedom fighters"" are often also referenced as assassins, rebels, insurgents, or terrorists. This leads to the aphorism ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"". The degree to which this occurs depends on a variety of factors specific to the struggle in which a given freedom fighter group in engaged. During the Cold War, freedom fighter was first used with reference to the Hungarian rebels in 1956. Ronald Reagan picked up the term to explain America's support of rebels in countries controlled by communist states or otherwise perceived to be under the influence of the Soviet Union, including the Contras in Nicaragua, UNITA in Angola and the multi-factional mujahideen in Afghanistan. 
A freedom fighter is different from a mercenary as they gain no direct material benefit from being involved in a conflict, though they may have no personal reason for being involved. Thus they are not considered mercenaries under the Geneva Convention and thus may in certain circumstances be protected by it (Mercenaries are not protected under the Geneva Convention and can be tried as criminals). In the media, the BBC tries to avoid the phrases ""terrorist"" or ""freedom fighter"", except in attributed quotes, in favor of more neutral terms such as ""militant"", ""guerrilla"", ""assassin"", ""insurgent"", ""rebel"", ""paramilitary"", or ""militia"".

Wife-carrying,"Wife carrying (Finnish: eukonkanto or akankanto, Estonian: naisekandmine, Swedish: kärringkånk) is a contest in which competitors race while each carrying a partner. Whilst most teams consist of a man carrying a woman there are generally no rules about gender or marital status. The objective is for the runner to carry their team-mate through a special obstacle track in the fastest time. The sport was first introduced in 1992 in Sonkajärvi, Finland.
Several types of carrying may be practised: either a classic piggyback, a fireman's carry (over the shoulder), or Estonian-style (""wife"" upside-down on his back with their legs over the neck and shoulders).

History
Eukonkanto originated in Finland. Tales have been passed down of a man named Herkko Rosvo-Ronkainen (aka Ronkainen the Robber). This man was thought to be a robber in the late 1800s who lived in a forest. He supposedly ran around with his gang of thieves causing harm to villagers. From what has been found, there are three ideas as to why/how this sport was invented. Firstly, that Rosvo-Ronkainen and his thieves were accused of stealing food and abducting women from villages in the area he lived in, then carrying these women on their backs as they ran away (hence the ""wife"" or woman carrying). The second suggestion is that young men would go to neighbouring villages, and abduct women to forcibly marry, often women who were already married. These wives were also carried on the backs of the young men; this was referred to as ""the practice of wife stealing"". Lastly, is the idea that Rosvo-Ronkainen trained his thieves to be ""faster and stronger"" by carrying big, heavy sacks on their backs, from which this sport evolved. Though the sport is often considered a joke, competitors take it very seriously, just like any other sport.
Wife carrying contests have taken place in Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, India, Germany, the UK and other parts of the world besides Finland and nearby Sweden, Estonia and Latvia, and the sport has a category in the Guinness Book of Records.

Rules
The original course was a rough, rocky terrain with fences and brooks, but it has been altered to suit modern conditions. There is now sand instead of full rocks, fences, and some kind of area filled with water (a pool). These are the following rules set by the International Wife Carrying Competition Rules Committee:

The most important rule is to have fun when carrying a wife
The length of the official track is 253.5 metres (832 ft).
The track has two dry obstacles and a water obstacle about one metre deep.
The wife to be carried may be your own, or the neighbour's, or you may have found her further afield; the wife must, however, be over 17 years of age.
The wife is a gender free term that is used over the carried person (Gender rule changed in February 2023)
The minimum weight of the wife to be carried is 49 kilograms (108 lb). If she weighs less than 49 kg, she will be burdened with a rucksack containing additiona",sports
Appeasement,"Appeasement, in an international context, is a diplomatic negotiation policy of making political, material, or territorial concessions to an aggressive power with intention to avoid conflict. The term is most often applied to the foreign policy between 1935 and 1939 of the British governments of Prime Ministers Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin and most notably Neville Chamberlain towards Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Under British pressure, appeasement of Nazism and Fascism also played a role in French foreign policy of the period but was always much less popular there than in the United Kingdom.
In the early 1930s, appeasing concessions were widely seen as desirable because of the anti-war reaction to the trauma of World War I (1914–1918), second thoughts about the perceived vindictive treatment by some of Germany during the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, and a perception that fascism was a useful form of anti-communism. However, by the time of the Munich Agreement, which was concluded on 30 September 1938 between Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, the policy was opposed by the Labour Party and by a few Conservative dissenters such as future Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War Duff Cooper, and future Prime Minister Anthony Eden. Appeasement was strongly supported by the British upper class, including royalty, big business (based in the City of London), the House of Lords, and media such as the BBC and The Times.
As alarm grew about the rise of fascism in Europe, Chamberlain resorted to attempts at news censorship to control public opinion. He confidently announced after Munich that he had secured ""peace for our time"".
Academics, politicians and diplomats have intensely debated the 1930s appeasement policies ever since they occurred. Historians' assessments have ranged from condemnation (""Lesson of Munich"") for allowing Hitler's Germany to grow too strong to the judgment that Germany was so strong that it might well win a war and that postponing a showdown was in the best interests of the West.

History
Failure of collective security
Appeasement policy, the policy of appeasing Hitler and Mussolini, operating jointly at that time, during 1937 and 1938 by continuous concessions granted in the hope of reaching a point of saturation when the dictators would be willing to accede to international collaboration.... It came to an end when Hitler seized Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939, in defiance of his promises given at Munich, and Prime Minister Chamberlain, who had championed appeasement before, decided on a policy of resistance to further German aggression.
Chamberlain's policy of appeasement emerged from the failure of the League of Nations and the failure of collective security. The League of Nations was set up in the aftermath of World War I in the hope that international co-operation and collective resistance to aggression might prevent another war. Members of the League were entitled to the assistance of oth",politics

Seamless branching,"Seamless branching is a space-saving mechanism used on Blu-ray Discs and, rarely, DVDs, to allow multiple versions of a film to be stored on a disc without storing redundant scenes several times.
One example is the Signature Edition DVD of The Iron Giant, where the user can select between the original theatrical version and an extended version. The two versions differ only in a few scenes. The DVD player is instructed to play the film normally except for these scenes, then jump to the appropriate scene as selected by the user before the commencement of the film, and then jump back to play the rest of the film. The disc is authored in a way which allows the joins to be invisible, hence the term seamless. (An example of a non-seamless branched title is the DVD version of The Lion King). Larger scale examples of the same technique are seen in the 2000 Ultimate Edition DVD of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the 2007 DVD rerelease of Blade Runner, the Platinum and Diamond Edition DVDs of Beauty and the Beast, and the 4K Ultra HD version of Conan the Barbarian, in which three different cuts of the films are playable from the same discs.
Another possible use of seamless branching is for the localisation (translation) of on-screen visible text. The Star Wars DVDs with their opening crawl are a prime example. Normally, only the audio track of films is translated into other languages, but when text central to the plot is visible on-screen, the scene may be created once for every language, and the DVD player can be instructed to select the appropriate version of the scene depending on the user's language preference. However, for this purpose a technique called multi-angle is used more often.

Cartel theory,"Cartel theory is usually understood as the doctrine of economic cartels. However, since the concept of 'cartel' does not have to be limited to the field of the economy, doctrines on non-economic cartels are conceivable in principle. Such exist already in the form of the state cartel theory and the cartel party theory. For the pre-modern cartels, which existed as rules for tournaments, duels and court games or in the form of inter-state fairness agreements, there was no scientific theory. Such has developed since the 1880s for the scope of the economy, driven by the need to understand and classify the mass emergence of entrepreneurial cartels. Within the economic cartel theory, one can distinguish a classical and a modern phase. The break between the two was set through the enforcement of a general cartel ban after Second World War by the US government.

Definitions
Cartel is an ambiguous concept, which usually refers to a combination or agreement between rivals, but – derived from this – also designates organized crime. The main use of ‘cartel’ is that of an anticompetitive association in the economy. In politics, it refers to a temporary alliance of several parties in election campaigns, for example. The scientific analysis of cartels is done by cartel theory.

Different spellings
In other languages, ""cartel"" might have different spellings. It is called cartello in Italian, kartell in German, Hungarian and Estonian, kartel in Dutch, Turkish and Slavic languages, kartelli in Finnish, and kartelis in Lithuanian. Even in the same languages, the spelling has varied over time. In German, for example, the spelling has gone back and forth between the c-initial form and the k-initial form.
Nevertheless, ""cartel"" is the most widespread worldwide because of its use in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese.
Though there is no difference in meaning between ""cartel"" with a ""c"" and ""kartel"" with a ""k"", they are not always interchangeable. Some institutions and organizations differ in name mainly in this letter, like the Kartellverband katholischer deutscher Studentenvereine and the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen, which are both umbrella organizations of Catholic student associations in Germany.

Etymology
The word ""cartel"" has its root in the Greek χάρτης (= papyrus scroll, paper, map) and came about the Latin ""charta"" (see Magna Carta, the English medieval law), the Italian ""cartello"" (diminutive of carta = paper, map) and the French ""cartel"" into the English and German language.: 51  In the Middle Ages, it designated an agreement on the fighting rules in the knightly tournament, then for duels. Until the 18th century, also the rules for noble games and courtly contests were named so. In modern times, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries, the term ""cartel"" was also used for intergovernmental agreements of technical kind: The guiding idea of a conflict confining clause came to light in various treaties between belligere",politics
Ghost surgery,"A ghost surgery is a surgery in which the person who performs the operation, the ""ghost surgeon"" or ""ghost doctor"", is not the surgeon that was hired for and is credited with the operation. The term ""ghost doctor"" can be interchangeably used with the term ""shadow doctor"" in South Korea. The ghost doctor substitutes the hired surgeon while the patient is unconscious from anesthesia. Ghost doctors are often unlicensed and unqualified to perform the operations they are hired for. Ghost surgery is widely considered to be unethical.
Today, ghost surgery is particularly common in the South Korean cosmetic surgery industry, in which it is ""rampant.""

History
The term ""ghost surgery"" was originally used to refer to qualified surgeons performing operations in the place of the unqualified physicians credited with the operation. By the late 1970s, following multiple highly publicized cases of medical equipment salesmen participating in surgery, it came to refer to multiple kinds of scenarios in which one individual substitutes the officially credited surgeon in an operation.
The Lifflander Report, a 1978 investigation commissioned by Speaker of the State Assembly of New York Stanley Steingut, found that 50-95% of surgeries in teaching hospitals were performed by residents under supervision, rather than by the lead surgeon. The report concluded that this generally does not decrease the quality of care, and is necessary for medical students to gain experience. However, patients typically do not understand and are not properly notified of the extent to which persons besides the lead surgeon will participate in the surgery.
Ghost surgery has continued as a practice into the present day; most reports of ghost surgery in the United States involve associates or residents performing operations to a greater extent than the patient consented to.
In South Korea, ghost surgery boomed in the 2010s with the increase in demand for plastic surgery, following the government's promotion of medical tourism. Ghost surgeries allow surgeons to double-book operations and otherwise maximize the number of patients they accept. Reports of ghost surgery in South Korea often involve dentists, nurses, or salespeople. One former ghost doctor reported that most substitutes were dentists.

Prevalence
As ghost surgeries are untracked, it is unclear how common they are. Patients typically discover a ghost surgery took place after undergoing an unsuccessful operation.
Hospital records from Parkland Hospital in 2007-2008 showed that there were 161 surgeries in which residents operated for some time without supervision. Of these surgeries, 18% of the time the surgeon was not present for any part of the operation. Overall, across these surgeries, the surgeon was absent from 83% of the total operating time.
Ghost surgeries are ""rampant"" in the South Korean cosmetic surgery industry today, and are increasingly common nationwide in other areas such as spinal surgeries. The Korean Society of Plasti",medicine
Rock climbing,"Rock climbing is a climbing sports discipline that involves ascending routes consisting of natural rock in an outdoor environment, or on artificial resin climbing walls in a mostly indoor environment.  Routes are chronicled in guidebooks, and on online databases, with the details of how to climb the route (called the beta), and who made the first ascent (or FA) and the coveted first free ascent (or FFA).  Climbers will try to ascend a route onsight, however, a climber can spend years  projecting a route before they make a redpoint ascent.
Routes range from a few metres to over a 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) in height, and traverses can reach 4,500 metres (14,800 ft) in length.  They include slabs, faces, cracks and overhangs/roofs. Popular rock types are granite (e.g. El Capitan), limestone (e.g.  Verdon Gorge), and sandstone (e.g. Saxon Switzerland) but 43 types of climbable rock types have been identified.  Artificial indoor climbing walls are popular and competition climbing — which takes place on artificial walls — became an Olympic sport in 2020.
Contemporary rock climbing is focused on free climbing where — unlike with aid climbing —  no mechanical aids can be used to assist with upward momentum.  Free-climbing includes the discipline of bouldering on short 5-metre (16 ft) routes, of single-pitch climbing on up to 60–70-metre (200–230 ft) routes, and of multi-pitch climbing — and big wall climbing — on routes of up to 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). Free-climbing can be done as free solo climbing with no climbing protection whatsoever, or as lead climbing that uses either removable temporary protection (called traditional climbing), or permanently fixed bolted protection (called sport climbing).
The evolution in technical milestones in rock climbing is tied to the development in rock-climbing equipment (e.g. rubber shoes, spring-loaded camming devices, and campus boards) and of rock-climbing technique (e.g. jamming, crimping, and smearing).  The most dominant grading systems worldwide are the 'French numerical' and 'American YDS' systems for lead climbing, and the V-grade and the Font-grade for bouldering. As of January 2025, the hardest lead climbing grade is 9c (5.15d), and the hardest bouldering grade is V17 (9A).
The main types of rock climbing can trace their origins to late 19th-century Europe, with bouldering in Fontainebleau, big wall climbing in the Dolomites, and single-pitch climbing in both the Lake District and in Saxony.  Climbing ethics initially focused on ""fair means"" and the transition from aid climbing to free climbing and latterly to clean climbing; the use of bolted protection on outdoor routes is a source of ongoing debate in climbing. The sport's profile was increased when lead climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing became medal events in the Summer Olympics, and with the popularity of films such as Free Solo and The Dawn Wall.
